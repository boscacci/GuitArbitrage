{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for grabs is a 1989 Fender Squier ll Stratocaster. This little gem is a player. This guitar has no pick guard, a barrel jack, and is H/S/S configuration. I have heard about these , but never had the chance to own one until now. There are surface cracks around the neck pocket (not cracks in the wood) from different temperature and moisture throughout the years. If you don't know the difference between a surface crack in the paint, and a crack in the wood, this guitar is probably not for you. The neck has a small separation crack at the fret board near the nut on the high E part of the neck. Once again, if you are not familiar with surface cracks, or separation cracks, this guitar is probably not for you. One of the tuners is missing the \"cap\" but if I was to keep this guitar, the tuners would be the first thing replaced. The tuner still functions 100% flawlessly. There is a waterslide of the word \" Celebration\" on the back of the head stock. This can be easily removed. This guitar was born in 1989 at the Sammick plant. I do my best to describe in detail every minuscule flaw any of my guitars may have. The surface/separation cracks do not affect the play-ability of this guitar whatsoever. I was surprised at the sound of the pickups in this little gem. The humbucker definitely growls and reminds me of early 80's alnico's. If you plan on bidding on this guitar and know you can't pay within 48 hours of the auction ending, please email me BEFORE the auction ends.
