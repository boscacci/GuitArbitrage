{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Nice 2006(?) Alvarez RF23SLB Baby Blue Regent Series Folk Guitar. Very comfortable neck and folk sized body in a gorgeous baby blue finish. The neck and folk size body feel great to me and are great for my style of playing. I've had this for several years and sadly it just hangs on the wall or stays in a case (not included) in the closet. I really do like this one and love playing it but I never do and I really need to slim down so someone is going to be very happy! Very nice used condition with very minimal wear or scratching. The original flat/satin finish was very thin which let's the guitar ring nicely and shows through a bit on the sides some as seen in pics.This is a nice playing and sounding unmodified original Light Blue Alvarez Folk Acoustic Guitar model RF23SLB that just wants to be played! No disappointments! Please take a good look at the pictures posted and ask any questions before purchasing. Winner is expected to contact and/or pay me within 24 hours of listing close or item may be relisted. Ships to lower 48 continental US states only. Shipping rate is calculated by eBay based on actually box weight and size. Guitar will be packed snug with strings loosened to assure safe transit and will be insured for purchase price.
