{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Kramer Focus Guitar! Extremely yellowed \"white\" paint \u2026 Needs strings and some tender loving care! Case handle is broke but come with new handle (needs to be installed) \u2026 Please see pics! Thanks for Looking! On Feb-03-19 at 04:59:09 PST, seller added the following information: In response to the numerous questions I've received \u2026 This was my first guitar, and was purchased somewhere right around 1987 from Strings & Things in Memphis, TN \u2026 I played it for a few years then gave it to my brother. He played it most of the early 90's, then it pretty much just hung in a smoke-filled studio for around 12 or so years \u2026 then into the case and the attic until recently discovered during a clean out last year. Debated on keeping it for sentimental value, but I only play bass now, and wouldn't really do anything with this \u2026 and from my research, these are still fairly popular! So, I've decided to let it go \u2026 There has never been any major damage or repairs to the guitar \u2026 no breaks, cracks. etc. It is all original including the case. The neck is straight with no bows or imperfections and the frets are in pretty good shape for it's age! Obviously the Floyd needs some attention (and that is one of the original Floyd Rose tremolos!) \u2026 The strap buttons are missing and not included, as well as the spring cover on the back. My brother had eye hooks for the strap like Eddie Van Halen had on Frankenstein & his Kramer guitars during the time he endorsed them \u2026 The eye hooks are not on the guitar any more either \u2026 The headstock \u2026 It was originally white with the Kramer Focus logo. It was sanded (stripped?) I believe by Strings & Things as well \u2026 It was painted with gloss black with a light coat of clear lacquer \u2026 How it got to how it looks now is anybody's guess! The guitar weighs 7.15 lbs on my digital scale \u2026 so, just shy of 8 lbs! Thanks for all the questions and the interest!", "ItemID": "123625974951", "EndTime": "2019-02-09T19:45:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-02T19:45:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-KRAMER-FOCUS-GUITAR-/123625974951", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cordova, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236259749518080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CVYAAOSwDsZcVfPn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dWQAAOSwa1hcVfPw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ScYAAOSwy6NcVfPm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/v2IAAOSwfTlcVfPr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wB4AAOSwUHBcVfPk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4M8AAOSwgQ1cVfPj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zWIAAOSwIkNcVfPu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pcIAAOSwxLFcVfPt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z28AAOSw3K1cVfPp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qYEAAOSwUh5cVfPc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/s5sAAOSwylBcVfPf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "38016", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "robsbassment", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1074, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 222.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 222.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6659}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P5DT1H4M17S", "Title": "VINTAGE KRAMER FOCUS GUITAR", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["kramer"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1987?"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["F-1000"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 322, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
