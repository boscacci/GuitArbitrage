{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Squier stratocaster MIJ, 1980\u2019s Vintage E Series serial number. I have owed this guitar since it was new. Purchased between 1984-87. All work including the custom made Ebony pick guard with abalone rose was done by professional Luthiers Phil and David Petillo. I\u2019ve upgraded some of the electronics over the years : Amp jack, selector switch, Dimarzio pickups.(Original pickups not located) sorry. Tremelo system locked down by tightening screws under backplate. Can easily be loosened to restore. Original arm included. The abalone inlay was done by David who is a true artist. Look up some of his work. Petillo guitars, Ocean NJ. He has some very famous clients including \u201cThe Boss\u201d Hipshot locking tuners have been installed. Original tuner heads included, as are white themed pickup covers, knobs, original manual etc. Maple neck has 21 frets, there is some light face wear but does not affect playing. If you will notice my luthier made a half moon opening under where the neck meets the body. This means you no longer have to take the neck off to adjust the working truss rod, a big time saver. This guitar plays and looks awesome. The action is set nice and low. The neck is a very shallow C style and very easy to play. Very light minor swirls on body but overall in very good condition. Original hard case included.Will ship UPS 1-5 day service.", "ItemID": "183661532179", "EndTime": "2019-02-06T15:58:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T15:58:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-Stratocaster-MIJ-1980-s-Vintage-E-Series-/183661532179", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bluffton, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836615321798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUyMlg2NDE=/z/kPUAAOSw6S9cSzl0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3Mlg3MDA=/z/3DcAAOSwyeNcSzmF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f6AAAOSwpLdcSyVM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3N1g4ODg=/z/2hsAAOSwE~ZcSzms/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgzNTQ=/z/AkkAAOSwO-pcSyzx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wpYAAOSwBwZcSfOt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTc2/z/di8AAOSwP85cSyVK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk0WDE2MDA=/z/FBUAAOSwGplcSyVE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/a3EAAOSw-yJcSyVC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "29910", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "johnjackp212", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 52, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 90.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "w***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 7}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT13H39M26S", "Title": "Fender Squier Stratocaster  MIJ, 1980\u2019s Vintage E Series", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Dimarzio Pickups, Custom Ebony Pickguard"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 150, "Subtitle": "Must sell really is a nice guitar", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
