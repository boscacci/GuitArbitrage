{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1990\u2019S VANTAGE BY SAMICK 111-T SUPER S-STYLE ELECTRIC GUITAR, RED, MAPLE, S/H PICKUPS A long time name in Canadian guitar making Jam Industries started this name in the 1970\u2019s and made it through the 1980\u2019s with their wide range of guitars built in Japan. The 1990\u2019s saw the name sold to Samick in Korea and the more entry level versions started to arrive. This 111-T is one of those models. A nice starter, this is a dual pickup (1xsingle coil, 1xhumbucker) electric solid body with most likely an alder body with a maple neck. Interesting dot positioning. By then the super strats were in and this modeled itself after that. One volume and tone control. Original whammy bar included. Relive your past or start a new student with this very affordable electric. This 1990\u2019s Vantage by Samick 111-T Super S-Style Electric Guitar is a used item in VG condition. There are no major dings, marks or scratches on this item with the exception of one ding pictured along the edge that chipped the paint and exposed the body wood. Pots have minor noise.
