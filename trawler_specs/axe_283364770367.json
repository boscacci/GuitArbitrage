{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Please read the entire description before you bid: Forsale I have a Jaguar style electric guitar finished in nitrocellulose lacquer. The body is a 2 piece Alder body that was built by Saylor custom guitars. The neck is an Allparts \"Licensed by Fender\" Jaguar JGRO neck. The body, and the front and back of the headstock, have two sealer coats of WATCO Nitrocellulose Lacquer, two color coats of Dupont 2818 Olympic White, followed by four clear coats of WATCO Nitrocellulose Lacquer to lock it all in. The back of the neck all the way down to the heel has been finished with Birchwood Casey's Gunstock oil to give it a smooth feel. The guitar has been played out with it a few times, so it does have a few bumps and bruises on it and some finish checking that I have shown in the pictures. A few things I wanted to point out -Some of the contour's around the body are not 100% perfect because I had to finish shaping them by hand.- The Fender Mute is only setup on the guitar for aesthetics, meaning that if you wanted to use it, you will have to drill the plunger hole.- I also only wired up the three main switches on this guitar(Lead, Rhythm, and Mid-tone cut) along with the master volume & tone control, if you want the rhythm circuit wired you will have to take care of that.- Last but not least this guitar is strung up with D'Addario 11-50 string's and is setup for my playing style, it is possible that you may need to have a setup done on it to fit your playing needs.
