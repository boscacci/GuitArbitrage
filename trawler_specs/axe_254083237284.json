{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states only by FedEx,no post office boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone by Gibson Les Paul Special GT Edition with some nice upgrades. The whole guitar is in very nice condition,just mild surface scratches. Guitar features all black hardware ,coil splitting and a tremolo. 22 fret neck shows zero fret wear . I traded out the closed back tuners with some nice diecast Grover style tuners.You can still see some of the holes on the back of the headstock from the old cheapie tuners. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on.Then I swapped out the stock pickups for some Hot Double White HMV 4 wire humbuckers , meter around 8k- neck,15k-bridge.Next I added a push/pull tone control so that when you pull up on the tone control you can split the humbuckers into single coils. Along with the three way switch this gives you six different pickup combinations. I also upgraded the stock tone capacitor with a nice Japanese polyester mylar film cap. Comes with my patent ought to be applied for black whammy bar with white tip. Sounded very full on clean tones and growled like my stomach in church once I added some gain. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. IF YOU LEFT CLICK YOUR MOUSE ON ANY OF THE PICTURES THEY WILL ENLARGE FOR A BETTER VIEW. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else.
