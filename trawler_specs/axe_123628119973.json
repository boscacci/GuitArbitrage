{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a very nice Ibanez RX 170. These guitars were produced from 1994-96. They are what is called a Super Strat. Dual Humbuckers with a single is the middle. With the 5 way Switch, you can\u2019t get some of the same tones of a Strat, but also all of the crunch of a Les Paul. The maple body and fretboard make this guitar nice and bright. It has some rub marks on the front of the body, above the bridge, which I took a pic of. (It looks like someone put a decal there and removed it). The Frets have some wear, but there is no fret buzz, or fretting out. The action has been set fairly low, and the neck is very straight. I completely go through all of the Guitars that I sell, so they should all be in good working order. They are not perfect, because they are used Guitars. I don\u2019t sell junk, or guitars that need to be taken to a shop and gone through. I already do that. This guitar has no case and the stand in the pics is not included. It will be professionally packed, shipped, and insured. No Tremolo included. The RX170 is a solid body electric guitar introduced by Ibanez in 1994. It is part of the entry level RX series. The RX170 features a hardwood body bolted to a maple neck with a 22-fret maple fingerboard with black dot position markers. Components include a TZ-30 synchronized tremolo bridge and Ibanez Powersound pickups in a humbucker/ single/ humbucker pickup configuration. The RX270 is a similar model with a TZ-100 tremolo. The RX160 is a similar model with a single-coil pickup in the neck position and a rosewood fretboard. This particular model was sold only in the American market and discontinued after 1996. Another model with the same name but with a rosewood fretboard was produced concurrently and sold in Europe and Japan.
