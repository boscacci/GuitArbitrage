{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "What the hell is a Korean made Stadium Guitar? I asked the same question before I tried it out. I'm a believer! I did a little research and found that most people that know about these guitars don't consider them a knock-off or a copy, but their own legitimate brand pushing excellent quality control over mass production. Tonal quality over inexpensive hardware. Wrapped up in a genuine luthier qualified build of an awesome playing, solid feeling, tone whoopin axe worthy of your play. This WT-240 is in excellent condition, MOP logo is just righteous. No flaws on the body, no dents worth mentioning, no scratches, no dings etc. Grover tuners are solid, frets are in great condition, and all the electronics work perfectly... Further, the pickups are really great sounding too, not too sure exactly what they are ...Maybe B&G? same as in the PRS SE line?
