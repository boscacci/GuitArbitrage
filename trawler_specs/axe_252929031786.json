{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is a very cool Jackson JS Series \"Custom Shack H/H 24 fret Dinky\". The 24 fret maple/rosewood neck has zero fret wear, and nice sharkfin inlays. The very cool Metallic Blue Arch top Body looks close to new with no chips,dings,or heavy scratches,does have a few light surface scratches. All black hardware[I do not have the black push in whammy bar for this guitar] . I upgraded the pickups to some Hot HMV Black/White Zebra pickups. I also put in a push/pull tone control so that the pickups can be split into single coils. Along with the three way switch this gives you six different pickup combinations. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound killer on this guitar. Surprised at how good this guitar sounds clean! The capacitor has been upgraded with a Orange Drop Style .022uf capacitor,more range of tone control and a smoother response. Guitar comes with a very nice lightly used Roadrunner gigbag. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! One of the better guitars I have built in a while. A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Action is very good and guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period!
