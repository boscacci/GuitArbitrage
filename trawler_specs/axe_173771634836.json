Most of these are going for $500 and up here on eBay, even though they only listed for $699 originally. I couldn't tell whether they were the set or bolt-on necks in some cases, this is definitely a bolt-on with 2 humbuckers (they're not active, but passive- that cover on the back that looks like a battery compartment is the selector switch cover), but without pulling them out to check the backs, I don't know they're DiMarzios (stock) or not. I didn't get a case with this, I'll ship it in a gig bag, or for $125 more in a rectangular hard case.", "ItemID": "173771634836", "BuyItNowAvailable": true, "ConvertedBuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "EndTime": "2019-02-10T20:58:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T20:58:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Rotor-EXP-RED-beauty-2004-06-good-condition-/173771634836", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Moundsville, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737716348368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTg=/z/~7gAAOSwnh5cUz7X/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zlcAAOSw9g1cUz7q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/9vkAAOSwCH9cUz8Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/7FoAAOSw7C5cUz8d/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/-7EAAOSw6o5cUz8p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/k3MAAOSwnh5cUz81/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ajUAAOSwx3FcUz-T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/uccAAOSw8U9cUz-r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "26041", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ticthak4tjy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 325, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P6DT1H49M58S", "Title": "Peavey Rotor EXP, RED beauty! 2004 or '06, good condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Rotor EXP"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}]}, "HitCount": 52, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "GOOD (+), some scratches and a ding or two on the body front & back, and 2 or 3 small divots on the neck you won't feel out of 1st position.Plays great, electronics are fine.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
