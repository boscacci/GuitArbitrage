{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! shipping to the lower 48 states.I will not ship anywhere else,Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool GDformosa Super Strat with some nice upgrades. This one was made in Taiwan. If you are not familiar with products made in Taiwan they have an excellent reputation,maybe better than Korean made. Has all black hardware,24 fret maple/rosewood neck with near zero fret wear. Has a small nick to the finish at the tip of the headstock that has been touched up. Otherwise guitar looks very nice with just mild surface scratches. Guitar is completely original except for the electronics . When I bought this guitar the original pickups were not included so I installed two rail type humbuckers in the neck and middle position and a full size HMV Zebra humbucker at the bridge. I also added a push/pull tone control so that the humbuckers can be split into single coils. This gives you 10 different pickup combinations along with the 5 way switch. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound killer on this guitar. The capacitor has been upgraded with a Orange Drop style epoxy film capacitor . More range of tone control and a smoother response. A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Looks,and sounds great. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
