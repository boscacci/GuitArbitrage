{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage Hondo 740 Near Mint Electric Guitar. Condition is Used. Shipped with USPS Priority Mail. If you are a Hondo collector, then you already know the secret. If you\u2019re not a Hondo collector, read on! From the 1970s through the 1990s the Hondo guitar company made copies of American guitars in factories in Japan and Korea and sold them all over the world. Just like all other major guitar companies, Hondo offered a range of instruments from low cost entry level models through more expensive high-quality models. The less expensive entry level models suffered from having poor quality tuners and the guitars would quickly go out of tune and sound terrible. To a brand new guitar player it was easy to form an impression based on the bad tuners that all Hondo\u2018s were bad. Aside from the tuners though, the guitars were actually quite good for the money. The higher level models often came stock with Grover tuners so this wasn\u2019t an problem. They also came with excellent pickups, toneful hardwoods, set necks, and some came with beautiful flame maple veneers, quality bindings and top-notch electronics. So here\u2019s the secret: many of these excellent guitars are still around and they still kick @$$! While thousand-dollar Gibsons sit in their cases, people play the heck out of their hundred-dollar Hondos. I once told my friend Glenn about my Hondo guitar and how awesome I thought it was. He invited me to his house to play his \u201creal Guitars\u201d so I accepted and went to his house where I played his $3000 guitars on his $3000 Marshall stacks and I\u2019m not gonna lie, they were awesome. Then I went to my car and got my Hondo and brought it in the house and gave it to him. He plugged it in, ripped off some riffs and was speechless. \u201cThere\u2019s no way this is a Hondo!\u201d But it was\u2014It was a stock \u201879 H-740 wine red with factory dimarzios and razor close action. He spent the next several hours playing it and he loved it. (He offered me twice what I paid for it). I said no and kept that guitar for another decade before I foolishly sold it. So here I am, foolishly selling another gem. Buy it please before I change my mind. And Thanks for looking at my item.", "ItemID": "173773629371", "EndTime": "2019-03-04T00:37:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-02T00:37:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Hondo-740-Near-Mint-Electric-Guitar-/173773629371", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fredericksburg, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737736293718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~JAAAOSwrjVcVK~~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VLwAAOSw1jpcVLAB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/a4cAAOSwZDJcVLAE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8w4AAOSw2zRcVLAF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RLUAAOSwMYtcVLAH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Dj8AAOSwJtJcVLAJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/B7oAAOSwM5tcVLAL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BIEAAOSwOShcVLAO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PBIAAOSwmqZcVLAQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g~sAAOSw3ltcVLAS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X44AAOSw0YlcVLAT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I~wAAOSwualcVLAV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "22408", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "johns1847", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 466, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "UY", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P27DT5H29M", "Title": "Vintage Hondo 740 Near Mint Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Hondo"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 135, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
