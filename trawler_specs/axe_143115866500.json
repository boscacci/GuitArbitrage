{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Feel free to make me an offer. This guitar is being sold on other web sites so first come first served. The Woodstock Anniversary Les Paul (I call it) The colors pop out and just say \"Hippy Burst\" and keep the acid tabs flowing as I crank this baby to eleven! Correct body shape and dimensions to a 59 lp, I used my best maple for this. A book match highly quilted maple top. The mahogany is 1 piece. Binding is excellent and the rosewood fret board is nice in figure. I shot a blue-green burst in nitro lacquer on the top. It will still need rubbing and polishing or...leave it as it is.. I prefer to use 2 way truss rods for more adjustment rather than the one way traditional. The neck angle is correct as is the head stock angle. It has a thick neck so if you wanted thinner just contour it down. I use a correct open book 59 head stock template so if you wanted to use one of those head stock overlays, it should work... And remember that this is an unfinished guitar...Please note that it will need final sanding on back and sides. There maybe a nick or small dent from being handled but nothing that can't be sanded out. shipping is 55.00 For an extra fee I can locate and drill the bridge and tailpiece holes etc. NOTE. FOR AN EXTRA FEE OF 249.00 I WILL DO THE FOLLOWING. DRILL BRIDGE AND TAILPIECE HOLESDRILL AND INSTALL GROUND WIREDRILL TUNER MOUNTING HOLES, CUT NUT, SET FOR PROPER STRUNG HEIGHT ACTION. THIS IS BASED ON CUSTOMER SUPPLYING HIS HARDWARE and a set of cheap strings TO ME.", "ItemID": "143115866500", "EndTime": "2019-02-10T22:00:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-03T22:00:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Christopher-Scott-Book-Matched-quilted-maple-top-LP-project-guitar-/143115866500", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ventura, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431158665008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/WVEAAOSwCCRcOksr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjM3WDEyMDA=/z/dxYAAOSw1qhcOks-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDUy/z/96EAAOSwlx9cOktA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTY5/z/rQMAAOSw6CRcOktA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE1WDEyMDA=/z/od0AAOSwgdtcOktO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4N1gxMjAw/z/9kkAAOSwU65cOkto/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDEyMDA=/z/YKsAAOSw~sJcOktr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTMy/z/HHAAAOSwmE9cOktq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODcwWDEyMDA=/z/gO8AAOSwPuRcOku~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA5WDEyODA=/z/SskAAOSwhY9cVPiU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQyWDEyMDA=/z/vuYAAOSwu4dcVPe~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDgx/z/rk0AAOSwCmVcVPer/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "93001", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "venturasailing", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1124, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1003}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ReserveMet": false, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P6DT2H51M18S", "Title": "Christopher Scott,    Book Matched quilted maple top , LP project guitar, ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 58, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 10, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
