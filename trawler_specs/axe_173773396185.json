{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Yamaha RGX A2 Electric Guitar. I am the original adult owner. This guitar is in excellent condition. It has been used very little and always safely stored. The finish is unmarked. This guitar uses \"alternative internal resonance technology\" in its body which cuts down the guitars weight to about five and a half pounds. In spite of its light weight, the guitar has a powerful resonant sound.The sound pick ups are Humbucker alnico V picks on the bridge and neck positions. These are passive pickups. The 9V battery is only for LED indicators to show which pickups are in use.The neck is solid maple with a rosewood fretboard. The tuning machines are die cast metal with gear drive. There is an adjustable truss rod. Included with this guitar is the original owners manual which is printed in multi languages. The original Yamaha adjusting tools come with it. Two sets of new strings as well as picks are included. There is also an amplifier connector cable as well as a shoulder strap.", "ItemID": "173773396185", "EndTime": "2019-02-08T21:16:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T21:16:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Yamaha-RGX-A2-Electric-Guitar-Original-owner-/173773396185", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Haverhill, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737733961858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/A5AAAOSwKwhcVLQ~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/Lg8AAOSwtutcVLRN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/VpoAAOSwP9NcVLRY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/9qgAAOSwTEZcVLRn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/~xQAAOSw3P5cVLRy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/ehcAAOSw4MNcVLR8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/D8wAAOSwYbdcVLSL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01835", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "randolph218", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 158, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P4DT2H35M18S", "Title": "Yamaha RGX A2 Electric Guitar Original owner", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Yamaha"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 59, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "137020079", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
