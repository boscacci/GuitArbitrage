{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2002 Esteban Midnight Legacy Electric Guitar Black. AMAZING! Yep, from that goofy dude that used to sell the biggest junk guitars known to mankind on QVC. These are the one exception. The one and only Electrics that ever came from wherever he had these made. These (somehow) turned out amazing! I had to try one since it had the Les Paul style body, but the Stratocaster styled layout with the 3 single coil pickups, whammy bridge, volume and 2 tone knobs and even the Strat output jack cup.This is 10000% black. Each and every piece. I have played these on a lot of gigs. I have hundreds of expensive guitars and brought these. I have 5 of them currently. I'm only selling my guitars because my wife just retired the last week of October and I promised I would sell a couple hundred axes in order to do what old folks do....downsize and take trips. You will find these guitars now and then much cheaper....but they won't be in perfect condition like mine ALWAYS are. They HONESTLY sound and play amazing. I don't want them gone. The \"E\" shaped headstock is like that because it stands for Esteban. It's actually groovy looking. This guitar that should suck is a diamond in the rough. No bag or whammy bar included. You don't want a whammy bar on here anyway....I've heard that they snap right off. Buy with confidence on this one. Many people have purchased them on my word alone via my YouTube videos.
