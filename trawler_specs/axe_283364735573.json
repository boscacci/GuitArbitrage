{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "ITEM DETAILS: Guitar has a crack. Serial number is A110306218. Comes as you see it. With the hard carrying case. See pictures for more details and descriptions. SHIPPING: Items ship to the USA only via USPS first class or priority mail. For heavier items I use FedEx shipping. Which is guaranteed the same amount of arrival which is about 2 to 5 business days. For FedEx items I cannot send to PO Box. Please message me if this is your only way of having item sent and maybe we can work something out. You may just have to pay a little extra for shipping. Not always the case though. Willing to accommodate for all my awesome and fast paying buyers! Orders over $350 come with signature confirmation. I love doing this as a courtesy for my customers. Should you message me and not want to have this service added to your shipping, please be aware that in the event that item gets lost we will not be held accountable. Same goes with an address change. Only PayPal and eBay approved addresses. We ship M-F only, so if you make a purchase on the weekend, it will not ship until Monday. All shipments include tracking. PAYMENT: Payments are accepted through Paypal only! RETURNS: If you are unhappy for any reason once the sale is complete, please contact me so that we can work out a resolution before leaving negative feedback.
