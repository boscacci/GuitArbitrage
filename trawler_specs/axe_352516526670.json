{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx only,no post office boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Xaviere XV-400 single cutaway set neck P90 electric guitar in a Gloss Sunburst finish with a nice Roadrunner hardshell case. These guitars are not available anymore although you can still see them at the Guitar Fetish store. Guitar is in very nice used condition except that it has a ding on the front bottom edge,otherwise just mild surface scratches. Neck shows zero fret wear. First I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. I also upgraded the capacitor with a .033uf axial film capacitor. Sometimes I change the caps and I don't hear a big difference, this time the change was quite noticable. Sounded very full on clean tones and has a nice snarl once you add some gain. Guitar plays,looks,and sounds great! A classy looking guitar that wants to kick some butt. Guitar looks great. Comes with a Roadrunner hardshell case that is in good used condition and fits the guitar very well. Please study the pictures to get a better idea of the condition. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
