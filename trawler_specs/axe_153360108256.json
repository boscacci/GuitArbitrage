{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2003 Squier Affinity Stratocaster in very good condition. I disassembled it and refinished it in Satin Black over Red with a lacquer clear coat. The plastic components have been aged. It is in a relic condition. The pots were changed to CTS style 500K, from MVG, which improved the tone 1000%. The sound is hard to believe for a Squier, it kicks sass! The pickups are now crisp and clean with an edge, great for blues or rock. All 5 switch positions function properly with no ground noise. It has a good set of closed tuners. The frets have been polished and the sharp edges have been buffed down. The frets are in very good condition. The Rosewood fingerboard has been treated twice. It plays very well up and down the neck with no buzzing or dead spots. The action is good and the intonation is set. I strung it with a set of Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinkys, 9-46. This guitar would be great for a beginner, or just jamming. With its relic look, you can beat it up and it will only look better. No case or bag included. It will ship. insured, via UPS ground to the U.S. 48 contiguous states only. Shipping will be between $25-$65, depending on your location. I will be happy to quote shipping costs ahead of time, just submit your city and zip code. Winning bidders: wait for an invoice before checking out and I'll add the proper shipping charge.
