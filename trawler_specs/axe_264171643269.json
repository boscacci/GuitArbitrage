{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Feel free to contact me for a in hand inspection!PLEASE SCROLL DOWN FOR MORE PICS!!Vintage 1960sImperial Florentine Double Cutaway Electric Hollow Body GuitarMade In Japan All Original Guitar, No Repairs or Refinishing PLEASE DO NOT mistake picture glare for flaws.. If you think your seeing something not mentioned in this listing, please ask!! There are lots of pics, so when you receive it, its exactly what you expected, if not better. No surprises with this sale.. Buy with confidence! Here's The Run Down: This is a Cool Sounding & Great Looking Vintage 1960's Imperial Electric Guitar that wasn't played to death and still in very good shape overall. The Original Sunburst Finish is in great condition for a vintage guitar. There are some flaws here and there as you would expect from handling, play and age, but nothing very significant (see pics). Flaws will consist of minor scratching, scuffs, marks and/or few dings & chips (see pics). There is minor fret wear and nothing that I would classify as actual buckle rash. The original hardware is in good condition, but does show minor wear/discoloring (pictured). I tried to take really good pics, so you can judge for yourself (see pics). There are no breaks or repairs. All electronics are original and operate perfectly with the exception of one tone pot does nothing. It appears that the nut came loose at some point and someone turned it until the wires came disconnected from pot. I'm sure all is still there to be reconnected. The only things missing are the truss rod cover and the pick guard. If your looking for a cool, great playing & looking vintage guitar that wont break the bank and your friends most likely don't have, this would make a great addition to your collection! ***Will come exactly as pictured*** This guitar sounds and plays very well! Although I think its set up great, everyone has their own preferences. If your not happy with its set up, it will be your responsibility and cost to have it set up to your liking. The neck is straight and the truss rod operates as it should. All electronics are original and perfect! Freshly set up with Super Slinky 9's. Everything operates as it should, and has never had, nor does it have any breaks or repairs unless noted above.
