{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You can find some information on S101 Guitars on the internet, apparently founded by former employees of Samick. The contoured fireglow body caught my eye, it had crusty strings on it when I found it and a loose jack. I removed the strings and gave the guitar a set up and polish, restrung and adjusted intonation. Light fret wear, some fingerboard wear, especially between first and second fret. I put some new light strings on it. Every thing works fine, controls are good, five way switch gives variety. Pickups not that great dry, but sound pretty good with distortion or drive. Tuners are economy type, but work. The output jack is stamped epiphone, maybe they are made in the same factory? The action is about .110\u201d across the 12 fret. Neck has a little relief left in it. I did tighten the truss rod. Might need a little more adjustment to your playing style. Would be a candidate for a pick up swap. The guitar itself weighs 6 pounds 13ounces! It will be de-tuned and bubble wrapped, I might remove the tremolo arm and bubble wrap and tape it to the neck. Shipped in new u-line box. I usually offer 2 USPS shipping options! Sold as is and no returns please!
