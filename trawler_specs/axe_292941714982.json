{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a red Fender Squire 50's Classic Vibe stratocaster with a vintage maple tint neck that someone traded into our music store. It's missing the back plate and someone replaced the original 9-screw pickguard with an aftermarket 11-screw pickguard, so two of the holes in the pickguard don't have screws through them, or holes into which to put the screws. SO: this guitar is not minty-fresh. However, it's very fun to play. The electronics are stock and work great, the neck is in excellent shape, there's a little wear on the frets but there's still years of life left in them, and again, this guitar is just fun to play. Whomever owned it originally replaced the stock strap buttons with Schaller straplocks, and they left the guitar strap with the guitar. Normally we just throw old guitar straps away, but this one looks brand-new and it's a deluxe double-stitched leather strap that sells for roughly $75-100 brand-new and we really really hate to throw stuff like that away.", "ItemID": "292941714982", "EndTime": "2019-02-07T19:17:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T19:17:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-Red-Fender-Squire-Classic-Vibe-50s-Reissue-Strat-w-Tinted-Maple-Neck-/292941714982", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Presque Isle, Maine", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929417149828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LegAAOSw7D1cU0dn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1tsAAOSw4F9cU0dv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jAgAAOSwcohcU0ZK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mNwAAOSwBPRcU0d5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mAkAAOSwjoFcU0ZT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VXYAAOSwIkNcU0eC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AYQAAOSwGPNcU0eK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bH0AAOSwTqtcU0db/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "04769", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kmhmusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 165, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 227.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 227.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 9}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P3DT35M50S", "Title": "Used Red Fender Squire Classic Vibe 50's Reissue Strat w/Tinted Maple Neck", "HitCount": 134, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 230.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
