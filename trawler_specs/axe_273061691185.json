{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here\u2019s a very cool 1987 Fender E Series Squier Stratocaster. I have to say that I am amazed with the quality of this guitar. The workmanship is excellent. Made in Korea, with a maple skunk stripe neck, rosewwod fretboard, and Gotoh tuners. Not only does it have a great feel to it, but it\u2019s a great playing and sounding guitar that appears to be all original. It has the 5 way selector switches for multiple tone combinations. The neck is straight and the frets are in good shape with plenty of life left in them. The body is clean with only a few dings and scratches. Has a small crack in one corner of the pick guard. Weighs about 7 1/2 pounds, and comes with a padded gig bag. I have tried to show as much as I could in the photos, please use the magnifier to view them in detail. Shipping is UPS or Fed-Ex, but we sometimes will ship Priority Mail for faster delivery depending on its destination. I am not shipping internationally at this time, and can only ship to addresses within the US. Please check my other listings in the coming days.", "ItemID": "273061691185", "EndTime": "2019-03-06T00:27:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-02-09T00:27:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1987-Fender-E-Series-Squier-Stratocaster-/273061691185", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Akron, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2730616911858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4XoAAOSwIbFafOnd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VSkAAOSwlJNafOnw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dcAAAOSw86JafOnf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G1gAAOSwklhafOnz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nYUAAOSw8RZafOna/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GV8AAOSwdTJafOnj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dSEAAOSwCglafOqI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/l5oAAOSwSKtafOqS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bdwAAOSwKM1afOns/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/srUAAOSwALtafOnu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rQQAAOSw-31afOnh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rrgAAOSwY7VafOnq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44321", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "leatherstuff.com", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4646, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P29DT3H19M29S", "Title": "1987 Fender E Series Squier Stratocaster ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1987"]}]}, "HitCount": 3500, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great playing guitar!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
