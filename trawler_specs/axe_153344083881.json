{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This used Samick Left-handed Greg Bennett Design Malibu Electric Guitar Is a great guitar for the beginning/advancing guitarist! It features the classic S-style body, bolt-on neck, 5-way pickup selector, a rosewood neck? In addition , we believe that the best feature is the Grover Tuning machines. They offer precision tuning, which means tuning become a breeze. These tuning machines sell on line new for $60, so when you figure that into the cost of the guitar, it\u2019s an incredible value. This guitar is also signed by Mr. Bennett! Coffey Music was lucky enough to have Greg Do an in-store clinic and the customer who purchased it, had him sign it. The guitar has a couple dings, etc, but nothing that effects its playability or sound. You might even say that it adds character! Lefties don\u2019t have the selection of righties, so if you are a southpaw, you should consider! Coffey Music in historic downtown Westminster, MD has proudly been serving the musical community since 1984!", "ItemID": "153344083881", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T12:07:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-18T12:07:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samick-Greg-Bennett-Design-Malibu-Electric-Guitar-Left-handed-/153344083881", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Westminster, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533440838818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gQkAAOSws0pcQTQ~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qOUAAOSwuNNcQTQ6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oAEAAOSwMflcQTRC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oDAAAOSwXAxcQTQ2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3KQAAOSwzhFcQTQ0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jKYAAOSwLeFcQTQ9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CEoAAOSwYPNcQTQ5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "21157", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "coffeymusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1085, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 132.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 132.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P12DT16H58M43S", "Title": "Samick Greg Bennett Design Malibu Electric Guitar Left-handed", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Malibu"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Samick"]}]}, "HitCount": 660, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=19022972", "StoreName": "CoffeyMusic"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "70303339", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
