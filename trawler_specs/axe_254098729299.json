{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this vintage 1985 Aria Pro ii RS Series guitar. This guitar was made in Japan by the Matsumoko plant. The guitar features a 5 way selector switch, 2 single coils and a humbucker at the bridge. The humbucker was a modification from a previous owner. The original tone knob has been replaced. There is also a small black little washer object that goes underneath the bridge that is missing for the high 'E\" string. I couldn't notice how this affected the guitar. The guitar comes with a locking nut and the fine tuners that I never used, but I will include these accessories with the guitar. I prefer fixed, stop tail bridges. I know some people prefer to block the tremelo system. All the electronics function on the guitar and it sounds great. The guitar being over 30 years old does have some dings and scratches. The most obvious damage are two dents on the fret board that appear to be cosmetic, as I can't tell if it affects the guitar in any way. The dents are on the 2nd fret space on the board and the 15th fret space on the board. I tried to capture the most obvious damage on the guitar in the photos. This guitar would be a good for a luthier or someone who is handy with guitars to restore it to its maximum potential. A cool guitar to add the collection, for the afficianados of Japanese guitars. I will only ship to the Continental United States. Please, take the time to check out my other guitars.", "ItemID": "254098729299", "EndTime": "2019-02-07T03:21:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-28T03:21:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Aria-Pro-II-RS-Series-/254098729299", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Donna, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540987292998080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/k4QAAOSwyKhbX3uN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/Zl4AAOSwnn1bX3ui/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/-rIAAOSwat5bX3u3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/FD4AAOSw2kNbX3v6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/iiwAAOSwqz9bX3xg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/KUIAAOSwvItbYFHa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/FJwAAOSw2kNbX3wS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/yPwAAOSwrh5bX3wx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/bMgAAOSwMbRbX3yZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/M8IAAOSwfrJbX3zZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/5UwAAOSwAllbX62W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/YHYAAOSwyjNbX62l/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "78537", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "marktko", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 57, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 130.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 130.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P2DT8H13M34S", "Title": "Aria Pro II RS Series", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RS Series"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Aria Pro II"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1985"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 109, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 130.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
