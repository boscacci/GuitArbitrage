{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I TOOK THIS IN AS TRADE FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNER FOR SOME WORK I DID FOR HIM. IT IS A 2015 IBANEZ RG6005 IN EXCELLENT, NEAR MINT CONDITION. HE IS A BASS PLAYER. SO IT WAS REALLY NEVER PLAYED. IT HAS A SOLID MAH (SAME WOOD AS LES PAUL) STRING THRU BODY WITH QUILTED MAPLE TOP. IT IS FINISHED IN AN ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS GLOSS TRANSPARENT RED. THE NECK IS MAPLE WITH R. WOOD FRETBOARD AND 24 JUMBO FRETS WITH ZERO WEAR. HE MADE SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS TO IT. THE ORIGINAL ACTIVE EMG GHUMBUCKERS WERE REMOVED. IT IS NOW LOADED WITH A SET OF CUSTOM WOUND XN2 BLADE STYLE HUMBUCKERS. THESE ARE WOUND TO THE SAME SPECS AS THE DIMARZIO X2N SET. BUT THESE HAVE A MORE PRONOUINCED BOTTOM END AND SLIGHTLY SMOOTHER HIGHS AND UPPER MIDS. THEY ALSO HAVE A NATURAL MID SCOOP. THEY ARE RUN THROUGH MASTER TONE AND VOLUME CONTROLS. THE VOLUME IS A COIL TAP FOR BOTH HUMBUCKERS. THE PICKUPS SOUND EXCELLENT IN CLEAN. WHEN SPLIT INTO SINGLE COILS, THEY ACTUALLY DO A PRETTY\u00a0VERY STRAT/TEL TONE. BUT BELIEVE ME, THESE LONG TO BE DRIVEN HARD IN FULL HUMBUCKER MODE. THE KILL SWITCH WAS REPLACED WITH A TONE POT WITH FENDER .047 CAP. THE CHEAP ASIAN 3 WAY SWITCH WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW FENDER USA 3 WAY SWITCH. THE BLACK CHROME HARDWARE WAS REPLACED WITH TRUE CHROME. THE STOCK TUNERS WERE REPLACED WITH A NEW SET OF PING 14:1 CHROME TUNERS. THE KNOBS WERE REPLACED WITH BLACK CLEAR BELL KNOBS. I CAN ALSO INCLUDE A SET OF BLACK SPEED KNOBS OR CHROME TELE STYLE KNOBS IF YOU PREFER.THE FRET ENDS WERE JUST DRESSED AND ARE SILKY SMOOTH. THE FRETS WERE JUST CLEANED AND THE FRETBOARD JUST OILED. THE GUITAR IS TREMENDOUSLY WELL SET UP WITH GREAT ACTION WITH 10-46 STRINGS. I WILL TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SHIPPING IS TO THE CONT. US ONLY. I WILL ONLY SHIP INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH EBAYS GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. PLEASE MAKE PAYMENT OR CONTACT WITH ME WITHIN 72 HOURS OF WINNING. THANKS, MICHAEL.
