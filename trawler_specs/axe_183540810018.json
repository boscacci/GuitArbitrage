{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "GUITAR HAS CHANGED SINCE ORIGINAL LISTING. PLEASE READ AND VIEW PICS CAREFULLY. Added a set of Ibanez AH1 (neck) and AH2 (bridge) pickups 1/10/18. These are medium output humbuckers with a decent range of tones, sort of like Dimarzio PAFs. Very good condition Ibanez Roadstar from 1987. Some finish bumps and bruises here and there, but nothing major. It looks as if a strap button was added to the lower horn at one point. I replaced the electronics with Bourns pots, and a Switchcraft jack. Nothing fancy, just 1 vol 1 tone with the original 3 way toggle. Has a treble bleed mod on the volume pot, but I kept the original cap for the tone control. As far as I can tell, everything else is original. I have an arm for the bridge, but I don't think it's original, as it looks like the arm insert on the bridge was modified to accept it. It fits fine and works, but I'm not a trem user so YMMV. Case not included. It's setup decent now, but will likely need adjusted to your preference after shipping. Ask questions before bidding, I'm always happy to take more photos if there's anything specific you want to see. My photography skills really suck and my camera isn't much better, but I'll do what I can. This is a used guitar, and I am not a luthier. There may be issues with this instrument that I do not have the skill to identify or even be aware of. Each of my listings is described to the best of my ability, and if you have any questions that I did not address in the listing or photos, please ask before bidding. Thanks! All reasonable offers considered. I generally ship the next business day after receiving payment, but there will be exceptions. This is listed locally and in other places online, so this listing will be closed if it sells elsewhere. If you want to negotiate, I can remove pickups, tuners, electronics, w/e it takes to get it into your price range, just message me with your offer. Look carefully at all pics and ask questions before you bid.", "ItemID": "183540810018", "EndTime": "2019-02-15T15:31:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-17T15:31:54.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Roadstar-Series-RG100-Electric-Guitar-White-1987-/183540810018", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Xenia, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835408100188080_4.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/PzYAAOSw~EBcN2E6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/IOMAAOSwRsxcN2E4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/0IgAAOSws~pcN2E9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/kCEAAOSwzDFcMjOA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/EIYAAOSwkERcMjOC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/URUAAOSw9xJcMjOE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/fcMAAOSwXitcMjPI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/3msAAOSwrQ5cMjOG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/2FQAAOSwLSZcMjN5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/-B8AAOSwws5cMjN6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/EHwAAOSwkERcMjN8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/UAkAAOSwPmVcN2E~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "45385", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chazmack", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 846, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P10DT19H2M44S", "Title": "Ibanez Roadstar Series RG100 Electric Guitar White 1987 ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1987"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RG100"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 730, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good shape for a 31yr old guitar.
