{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1993 Godin G Series USA Built G-1000 Electric Guitar This Guitar is used and does show some signs of use including some light dings and scratches. Nothing you can see from across the room, but after 25 years, there are quite a few little spots that you can see up close. I tried to get all of them in the photos, so please be sure to look at all photos before purchasing. One minor issue is that the volume knob cover is kind of stripped on the inside and doesn't stop turning when the volume is all the way up. It also comes off... I have found it easier to keep the button off but I still have it and it will be included. The actual volume knob below the cover works perfectly... it's just the cover that has the issue and it is easily replaceable. Other than that, everything is working perfectly. The neck is straight, the action is low and comfortable, and the frets are in great shape. Awesome guitar to play! I recently acquired this guitar locally and it actually does not show the model number on the body. I reached out to Godin to see if I could find out a bit more about the guitar and I have a screenshot of their reply in the photos. It is a 1993 G-1000. 25 years old! These guitars are pretty rare... I was not able to find many of them for sale. Godin is an excellent brand and this guitar is very nice.
