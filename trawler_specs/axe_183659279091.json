{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a really nice 2003 Yamaha Pacifica pac 112X. Very good used condition. All natural wood grain solid body with black pick guard and pick ups (H/S/S) and 5 way switching, is really sharp. The maple neck is gorgeous along with the head stock. Indonesian build. Plays very well. Please look at all pics. #10 shows the area with the only noticeable dings along the lower bout top edge. Other than that, there's a bit of very light buckle scuff on the back, and the usual light pic marks and scuffs. The neck is just gorgeous, fret board too. Neck is straight and truss rod fully adjustable. There is a good reason why Yamaha has been recognized for generations as a premiere maker of quality musical instruments. Has new strings ( 9 - 46's), Will come with and shipped in the quality, padded gig bag shown. Shipping is to Canada and the lower 48 U.S. only. Please ask any questions prior to bidding/buying. Thank you!", "ItemID": "183659279091", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T03:49:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T03:49:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Yamaha-Pacifica-2003-pac112X-Solid-Wood-grain-Body-Maple-Neck-Beautiful-/183659279091", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Whitby, Ontario", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836592790918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/xJMAAOSwt0dcPNuV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/3SQAAOSwhYJcPNun/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BkYAAOSwseFcPNu6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/72YAAOSwsO5cPNvT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/n-wAAOSwNBJcPNyY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/olMAAOSwFZZcPNwF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/bJ8AAOSwaaNcPNwN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/UcYAAOSwUlFcPNwf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/oocAAOSwFZZcPNwq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/mb8AAOSwQXlcPNw3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BYQAAOSwb-1cPNxG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ioUAAOSwkHxcPN0F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "L1N 7K9", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "romacpherso_5", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 106.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 139.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT1H28M44S", "Title": "Yamaha Pacifica 2003 pac112X Solid Wood grain Body Maple Neck Beautiful!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Yamaha"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2003"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 156, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 139.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
