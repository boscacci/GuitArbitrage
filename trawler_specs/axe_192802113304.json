{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your consideration is this awesome 2012 Gretsch G5410 Electromatic Special Jet Black Husk. This body neck project is in very good pre-owned condition. There are some light scratches, dings and swirls on the front and back. Guitar has been played. These marks are all invisible from a few feet away. You have to get up close and inspect the body to see any flaws. There is one minor 1-1/4\" light, narrow scratch that does slightly go through the finish on the back. Also, there is a slight chip on the rim of the tuning peg mounting hole on the headstock. Overall, I'd give the cosmetic condition a 7/10. The G5410 Electromatic Special Jet features a basswood body, maple neck with rose fretboard. Nut is synthetic bone and appears to have fallen out at some point and been glued back on as it is not perfectly flush with the neck on both sides. This doesn't affect playability but worth mentioning. Radius is 12\". Body is routed for Gretsch dual-coil pickups and Adjust-o-matic bridge. It weighs 7 lbs., 5 ounces and fully dressed is a little over 9 lbs., so no light weight. Neck measures 42.88 mm at the nut and 55.48 mm at the 16th fret where the neck meets the body. It is 21.10 mm thick at the first fret and 23.74 mm thick at the 12th fret. If you're searching for a fantastic Gretsch body neck project then you simply cannot go wrong with this one.
