{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx,no PO Boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Most deliveries will require a signature. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone by Gibson Les Paul Special Custom Shop Limited Edition Satin TV Yellow finish with some nice upgrades. I switched out the stock P90's for some nice High Output Cream colored P90's from The Stratophere. Guitar is in excellent used condition, only very mild surface scratches. I traded out the closed back tuners with some nice Kluson style tuners.You can still see some of the holes on the back of the headstock from the old cheapie tuners. The neck shows near zero fret wear and the action is very good. I upgraded the stock tone capacitor with a nice Soviet military surplus paper in oil capacitor. Sounded very full on clean tones and snarls real nice once I added some gain. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is.
