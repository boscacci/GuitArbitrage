{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I brought this guitar from Hastings a few years ago. It sounds good, plays good, and has served me well. The reason I am looking to sell it is mainly because I don't really play on it anymore. I mostly play on my main guitar now, and I would prefer that this guitar get some use from someone who will play it instead of it collecting dust in the corner of my bedroom. It features a rosewood, 6 string, 22 fret fret-board, 3 adjustable single coil pickups, a 5 way pickup selector switch, two tone and one volume control, a tremolo system (I do not recommend using the tremolo, because any guitar with this type of tremolo system tends to get thrown out of tune almost immediately, there is nothing functionally wrong with the tremolo system, simply that this is the reality with any guitar without a locking nut and a Floyd rose). It has a few nicks and bumps in some places, (I tried to show them in the pictures). I would recommend it for a beginner guitarist, as It is a cheap guitar and it has a noticeable lack in quality, but is more than playable. I have it set up and intonated properly, no need to adjust the action. However, the strings are quite old, and may need replacing. I am selling this locally.", "ItemID": "163092708897", "EndTime": "2019-02-06T17:04:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-06-11T17:04:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Local-Used-Generic-Spectrum-Classic-6-String-Stratocaster-Design-Guitar-/163092708897", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Conway, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1630927088978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/y5wAAOSwcfdbGqCx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/YiwAAOSwCXJbGqC-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzMFg5MDA=/z/TTQAAOSw--xbGuRy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/GPkAAOSw7m9bGqDH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/sz8AAOSwN2VbGqDL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/zZ8AAOSwrptbGqDM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "72032", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blamar-43", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 90.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 90.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT14H44M27S", "Title": "Local, Used, Generic, \"Spectrum\" ,Classic 6-String, Stratocaster Design, Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Bullet"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Listing", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}]}, "HitCount": 380, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
