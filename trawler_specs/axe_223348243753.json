{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Horner G2T guitar in its original case in real nice shape, not perfect but really nice. There are the usual dink\u2019s and playing swirls in a guitar this old. The case is a bit dusty but is all there looking and working great for a twenty year or so guitar case. I am adding a steinberger drop d tuning and string top for these guitars, a extra top string holder and a steinberger strap arm for these guitars. Oh yeah there\u2019s also three sets of La Bella\u2019s blues gauge strings and a quick clip strap with two extra ends in black and white. The pictures are a large part of this description. If you are looking at this I am assuming you are familiar with the guitar. This guitar was played on the regular up until about five years ago so the pots could probably use a spraying. Other then that it plays and sounds great. It has been kept in a controlled environment while I have owned it other then when playing. This is a used item and may take some work or love to make it fit your style or playing personality. That being said there is no guarantee is given or implied, And I will only ship to the lower 48 states.
