{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is a Floyd Rose brand guitar in a dark/deep blue, with the SpeedLoader bridge. Awesome way of making the string changes really, really fast. Has its share of scratches and dings, mostly on the body, the neck is rather smooth--it's no showcase guitar, but a good player! Note that this is also the SpeedLoader version with the tremelo (no bar included, but it takes the standard kind); most models seen around are the much less exciting hardtail versions. This one also has an adjustable block installed by the previous owner in the spring cavity, making it easier to tune. The only reason I'm selling is I had a recent elbow surgery, and that makes it difficult to play; so this guitar should be enjoyed by someone who will use it much more. The original neck pickup had an output problem and was nearly silent, so both pickups were swapped for Guitar Madness G.M. Hexbuckers which sound great, and they still have the original plastic covering on them. Feel free to ask any questions! FREE SHIPPING to the lower 48 states!A hardcase is also available for this guitar for an additional $60, or a soft gig bag for $10--let me know before paying and I'll include it.
