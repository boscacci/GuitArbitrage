You are looking at a 2018 Jackson SL2P HT MAH Pro Series Soloist. Beautiful Carmel Burl Finish. With a mahogany body, poplar burl top, an oil-finished maple neck, and lightning-fast ebony compound-radius fingerboard, you'll be free to explore and hone your own style. In addition, a flexible duo of Duncan Distortion humbucking pickups in the bridge and neck positions gives you a massive array of tonal possibilities. Topped off with eye-catching black nickel hardware, the Jackson SL2P HT MAH Soloist is gig-ready when you are. Engineered from its inception for high speed, technically demanding guitar playing the Pro Series Soloist\u2122 SL2P HT MAH is a purebred shred machine. The fine minds at Jackson put their heads together and created the next evolution of innovative guitars, melding sound, playability and ultra-modern style into a unique music machine that redefines metal prowess. Premium features include a resonant mahogany body with a poplar burl top and a one-piece through-body maple neck with scarf joint and graphite reinforcement rods to provide stiffness and stability, guarding against temperature- and humidity-induced bending and warping. Its lightning fast 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets is designed for highly technical light speed playing\u2014more curved by the nut for comfortable chording, it flattens out as you move up the neck (with hand-rubbed oil back finish) for increasingly fast playing speed and wide bends without fretting out. Chosen specifically for their incredible sound, a pair of modern Seymour Duncan\u00ae Distortion humbucking pickups drives this guitar\u2019s voice, combining for highly balanced, flexible tone, with plenty of high output for pristine cleans and snarling distortion. Single volume and tone controls shape the pickups\u2019 output, which can be further refined with the three-way pickup toggle switch for the precise voice required to bring your musical vision to life, while a Jackson HT6 string-through-body hardtail bridge provides endless sustain. Jackson has a reputation for adding striking style to its high-performance instruments, and this axe is no exception. Available in Carmel Burl, the SL2P HT MAH is completed with black hardware including the Dunlop\u00ae strap locks and the sealed die-cast locking tuners, alumiloid piranha inlays and single-ply binding around the body, neck and traditional Jackson pointed 6-in-line matching headstock.Tech Specs Body Type: Solidbody Body Shape: Soloist Left-/Right-handed: Right-handed Number of Strings: 6 Body Material: Mahogany Top Material: Poplar Burl Body Finish: Satin Color: Carmel Burl Neck Material: Maple Radius: 12\"-16\" compound Fingerboard Material: Ebony Fingerboard Inlay: Alumiloid Piranha Number of Frets: 24, Jumbo Scale Length: 25.5\" Nut Width: 1.6875\" Nut Material: Black Plastic Bridge/Tailpiece: Jackson HT6 String-through-body Hardtail Tuners: Jackson Die-cast Locking Neck Pickup: Seymour Duncan SH-6N Distortion Humbucker Bridge Pickup: Seymour Duncan TB-6 Distortion Humbucker Controls: 1 x volume, 1 x tone, 3-way toggle pickup switch Strings: NPS, .009-.042 Our luthier did a complete setup.
