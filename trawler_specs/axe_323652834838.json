{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a great guitar. I love old Peavey's and buy just about every one I find for sale. They are simply one of the best playing values out there. It has a Maple 25.5 inch scale neck with a Rosewood fretboard a Basswood body with real binding. I put new d'addario extra light strings on it (my fav). I also gave it a good check out. Had a blast doing it too. You may want to have your tech adjust just the way you like it but I found it very easy to play as is. All the electronics work great. The action is nice and low. Intonation is right on. Truss rod is working and it's a double action one! The one bang on the upper back (pic 9) I made look as bad as possible. The light is really reflecting in the epoxy filler that was used. It hardly shows in normal light but it's there. Outside of normal player wear,pick scratches, back scratches all minimal for it's age that bang is the only real damage and it's on the back side. I will ship it in a serviceable old gig bag. The serial number and place of manufacturer were removed so I can't give exact information. I believe this model was made in Korea or China in the late 1990's or early 2000 period. It's great as is but easy to hotrod or put in a straight Tele 2 pickup combination. Please look closely and ask any questions you may have.
