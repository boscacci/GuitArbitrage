This guitar was made to shred and I have not been giving it its due. Guitar has a lot of nice hardware and a wicked inlay and shape. The instrument sounds great and features the same pickups used by Metallica and other metal bands, check the interwebs for some videos. Guitar shows signs of use as typical for a 10 year old instrument (small scratches and wear marks) with additional dings/dents noted below. I believe this was on the top end of ESP's F series at the time and they do not make it anymore. A used hard shell shaped case is included with this instrument. The exterior of the case has some blemishes on the corners but the inside is in excellent condition. The pictured guitar stand is not included with this listing. Thanks for browsing! This guitar is not basswood despite what the details may say, its all mahogany baby. Major dings/dents (AKA BATTLE DAMAGE) flavoring this used instrument can be found on the following locations:Top of head stockOn headstock \"LTD\" labelCut on bottom cutawayConstruction / Scale - Set-Thru / 25.5\"Body - Mahogany w/ Flamed Maple TopNeck / Fingerboard - 3-Pc.
