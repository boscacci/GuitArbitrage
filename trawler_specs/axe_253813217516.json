{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! shipping to the lower 48 states.I will not ship anywhere else,Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Jackson JS Body/San Dimas style Neck \"Custom Shack HH Dinky\". The 22 fret maple/rosewood neck has zero fret wear ,and was removed from a new unbranded strat style guitar,not Jackson licensed so no decal on this one.The neck has a nice beefy feel to it and has a minimum of finish which feels smooth as you play. The Body has several flaws,the previous owner managed to put a ding on the back edge that has been rather poorly touched up,and then they decided to put an extra strap button hole on the back, the front of the body is very nice with mild surface scratches.The pickups are some Black/ Cream Zebra Humbuckers,8k-neck,15k-bridge. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The pickups sound killer on this guitar. The capacitor has been upgraded with a Orange Drop Style .022uf capacitor,more range of tone control and a smoother response. Has a two point big block tremolo,however I do not have the push in whammy bar. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Action is good and guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
