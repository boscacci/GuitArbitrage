{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2005PRS SEBILLY MARTINPAUL REED SMITH\"GREEN BAT SPECIAL\"Hi and thanks for looking.This is a great playing and sounding guitar.It was Made by Paul Reed Smith during 2005 in Korea.It includes the deluxe PRS SE gigbag and the unsigned warranty card.There are NO cracks or breaks to this guitar.The neck is straight,the frets are in great shape and everything works as it should.It hasn't been played much but was left sitting in the stand most of the last 13 years.So,it has a few small nicks and such.It has been polished a lot so that the finish is shinier in spots.There are small splatter circles in the finish that look about like the size of small rain drops.These don't readily show but can be seen when turning it in the light.I can only guess that a drink was opened and splattered the guitar and dried.They don't wipe off but show only when close and in the right light.It has a Green Bat inlayed in the neck with green fret markers.These are factory graphics.Includes the similar themed Levys strap in the last photo.Please, see all photos and click to enlarge before bidding.
