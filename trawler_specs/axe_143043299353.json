{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Stunning 2005 Fender Squier telecaster. This is a 2005 51\u2019 squier telecaster body, which is the most desirable looking telecaster body in my opinion, upgraded with a 2005 Squier telecaster custom neck. The neck is fantastic and rivals some MIM and USA guitars I\u2019ve owned and played. This guitar was really well maintained and is a players guitar with tasteful modifications and upgrades. New strings as well. The guitar originally came with a single coil pickup and Humbucker. This has been replaced with two Alnico 5 lipstick pickups as well as the proper compensated telecaster bridge. There are two holes where the input jack was upgraded and 2 small holes on the back from screws. They are tiny and none of these holes affect the playability in any way and are there only because the guitar was upgraded. I tried to take as detailed photos as possible so you can see. Guitar is in beautiful condition and well maintained for the last 13 years. I\u2019m a strat guy so I\u2019m looking to reinvest this guitar sale into a strat. These stock and factory can sell for more.", "ItemID": "143043299353", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T15:48:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T15:48:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2005-51-Squier-Telecaster-2005-Squier-Tele-Custom-Neck-Modded-/143043299353", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Santa Clarita, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430432993538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fjEAAOSwRWZcCpXY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hPkAAOSwdHpcCpXg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WVgAAOSwlAVcCpXa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cDUAAOSwWH1cCpXV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HCkAAOSw8R9cCpXW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hj0AAOSwIABcCpXe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p9sAAOSwGD1cCpXZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qLUAAOSw1T1cCpXc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F18AAOSwwjRcCpXT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ON4AAOSwj5BcCpXd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91390", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "janewalch", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 21, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT13H28M50S", "Title": "2005 51\u2019 Squier Telecaster With 2005 Squier Tele Custom Neck Modded", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}]}, "HitCount": 712, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
