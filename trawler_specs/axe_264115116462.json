Condition:This used instrument is in very good condition with minor wear. Please see pictures for details on item condition. Product Details:The CD2 CONCORD has a combination of a fixed bridge and arch top body, which provide an incredibly rigid platform for the string. This results in an exceptionally strong string attack and great sustain. The set neck makes for strong neck to body contact, which also improves the string\u2019s performance. The compact headstock prevents string energy from being absorbed and compromising performance. The long top horn, which shifts the weight to the back of the guitar, combined with the lightweight headstock, make the Concord a really comfortable guitar on stage. The Duncan Designed pickups insure a wide range of professional tone and deliver all the inherent sting power offered in the Concord. The black multi-ply reverse binding gives it an edgy, unique look. The High Tech Quilt top guitars always have a black back. This little touch gives the guitar a much harder look.

The CD2 CONCORD has a combination of a fixed bridge and arch top body, which provide an incredibly rigid platform for the string. Shipping FAST and FREE shipping!
