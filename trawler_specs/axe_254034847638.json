{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx,no PO Boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Most deliveries will require a signature. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Maestro by Gibson Les Paul Junior with some nice upgrades. Guitar is in great condition. I upgraded the tuners to some nice Grover style diecast tuners. The body looks very good with just mild surface scratches and some mild indentations. I replaced the stock pickup with a nice Black/White Zebra 4 wire Humbucker pickup. I replaced the stock tone control with a push/pull tone control so you can split the humbucker into a single coil. Next I upgraded the tone capacitor with a Japanese polyester film and foil capacitor. Sometimes I change the caps and I don't hear a big difference,this time the change was quite noticable. Sounded very full on clean tones and has a nice super nasty growl once you add some gain. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. A classy looking guitar that wants to kick some butt. Please study the pictures to get a better idea of the condition. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is.
