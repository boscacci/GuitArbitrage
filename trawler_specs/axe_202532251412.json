{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Squire II Stratocaster Dakota Red W/ Rosewood Neck 1989/90 With Upgrades I have installed NEW CTS pots, Oak Grigsby 5-Way Switch, Gotoh tuners and new bridge saddles(I will send the old ones if you wish to have it look more authentic,but they will need some cleaning). The fretboard is rosewood with 21 frets and a 9 1/2 radius. It weighs roughly 9-1/2 lbs. The frets have been leveled and polished and have plenty of life left. The guitar has been intonated with new strings and the fretboard has been cleaned and oiled. Comes with a gig bag. Sorry no tremolo bar. Everything works as it should now. Being made in India for a short period all the pots, parts, pickup switch and screws were smaller. So some modding has been done to make the better parts fit. Also it has the swimming pool route, so the pickup configuration is limitless, and is only a ten screw pickguard. I have put holes underneath for an standard 11 hole pickguard but you will have buy new pickups as the original ones are larger. It has minor scuffs and scratches but not bad for a guitar of 28+ years old. With that said it does play great with nice low action and sounds good. Sorry no shipping outside the United States.
