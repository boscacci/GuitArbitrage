{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Submitted for your approval: Some miscellaneous ESP/LTD parts. These were some pieces I was collecting as I was contemplating a guitar project. Needless to say, that project has long been abandoned, so I have a few parts that I have no intention of ever using. I had many other parts during that build phase, but they have all been re-purposed and in use elsewhere, and are not being listed for sale. The parts that are for sale here are: One (1) near mint ESP/LTD Floyd Rose, Cosmo Black, no whammy bar, (Looks like chrome from one angle, then black from another angle). One (1) used ESP truss rod cover, no screws. And one (1) near mint ESP/LTD chrome neck plate, no screws. You can ask me for just one of the parts, or you can have all three, just ask and I will split the items up. From a smoke-free, pet-free household. Free shipping to lower 48 states. What you see in the pics is what you get. Feel free to write back with any questions.", "ItemID": "143108819614", "EndTime": "2019-02-04T21:00:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T21:00:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-Floyd-Rose-Tremolo-Neck-Plate-and-Truss-Rod-Cover-/143108819614", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Daytona Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431088196148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/mlsAAOSwtYZcO-gN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/SlgAAOSwHDdcO-gY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/dfAAAOSwyBRcO-ge/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/jg8AAOSwIApcO-hM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/SpIAAOSw6PxcO-g7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/qJkAAOSws0pcO-iD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "32114", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jacico", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 345, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 40.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 40.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT4M49S", "Title": "ESP LTD Floyd Rose Tremolo, Neck Plate, and Truss Rod Cover", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Esp Guitars"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["ESP/LTD"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Unknown"]}]}, "HitCount": 21, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 40.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
