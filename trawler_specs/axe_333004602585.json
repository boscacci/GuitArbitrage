{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Vintage 1991 Fender Squier II Stratocaster MIK in Black with Tremelo and Squier Gig Bag is a one-owner guitar in very good condition, especially considering it is 28 years old. The original finish is still very shiny but has been touched up in a few areas and has other small scratches and bumps (see pics). The original owner said it has character. The rosewood fingerboard is in very good shape, the frets have some wear since it was a \"player\", but they still have a lot of life. Very low action and great intonation, new strings (42-9s). All electronics still work as they should, including the 5-way switch. The three single coil pickups sound great, still has that awesome Strat sound! This guitar is very good looking and an absolute pleasure to play. It comes with the original Squier gig bag. Please view all pics as they are a part of the description and ask any questions. We won't sell anything we would not play ourselves. Thanks for viewing!", "ItemID": "333004602585", "EndTime": "2019-02-08T02:47:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-09T02:47:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1991-Fender-Squier-II-Stratocaster-Black-Tremolo-and-Squier-Gig-Bag-/333004602585", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Alexandria, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330046025858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MjM=/z/4bIAAOSwQZdcNBGJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SkUAAOSwZelcNUhk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDQ1/z/JwIAAOSwFtNcNBGN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FPQAAOSwxtVcNUhg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MDoAAOSw-sVcNUhj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1NlgxNjAw/z/9fMAAOSwg1JcNBGU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDky/z/tmcAAOSwuQhcNUhf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zekAAOSwrfRcNUil/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yuoAAOSw7R9cNUij/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MToAAOSwZ8pcNUip/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aPMAAOSwEJ1cNUio/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1JIAAOSwmvpcNUim/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "16611", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gallowayoriginals", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 99, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 205.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 205.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P3DT5H40M3S", "Title": "Vintage 1991 Fender Squier II Stratocaster Black with Tremolo and Squier Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1991"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Squier II Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 183, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "In very good condition, especially considering it is 28 years old.
