{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a Gibson logo Epiphone Les Paul Junior in need of a bridge fix. The wrap around bridge is tilting forward as is the fate of many of these Juniors. This guitar is stamped used so it is some sort of factory 2nd. The date is hard to say with the orange stickered serial number, I\u2019m guessing early 2000\u2019s. This guitar is a project piece because of the bridge problem. On to the positives........this guitar has barely been played and is in sparkling condition. The color appears somewhere between gold and silver. Fairly rare color. No dings, wonderful neck, frets and fretboard.....tuners good but upgrade here is always nice, original pickup that wants to rock, only the slightest scratching on the pickguard, plastic still on back cover. I\u2019ve oiled the fretboard. If the bridge post holes were doweled and redrilled perpendicular to the body allowing the bridge to be adjusted to the proper intonation ( I would consider an aftermarket wraparound with adjusters on each string) .... a quality nut and a nice set of tuners, this would be a dynamite guitar. These are inexpensive fixes for a handy person. This is a solid almost 8 pound guitar. Yes it is a ply body. I have heard great sounding ply body guitars. I can hear great and tight resonance in this one but proper intonation would unleash it\u2019s potential. I am almost always amazed at what these inexpensive Epiphones can crank out when property adjusted and or modified. This one will be special. Check out my pictures and ask questions you might have. I can send more pictures if needed. Check our eBay rating and feedback. I sell the guitar stuff. I ship promptly, carefully and insured. Sale is intended to be final.
