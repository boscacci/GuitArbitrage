{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson Epiphone G-400 SG Worn Cherry with Probuckers - Binding & Full Pickguard! *I am a professional guitar tech in Aurora, IL* To my knowledge, this is the ONLY Worn Epiphone SG (G-400) with binding and full size pickguard. I bought it with the small pickguard and converted it to the full size one, which was more complicated than expected. I had to move the 3 way switch, shave down the bottom of the tune-o-matic, and fill a screw hole, among other things. But it turned out really well! I also installed Epiphone Probuckers - which in blind sound tests were every bit the equal to Burstbuckers. As for the condition, it does have it's share of dings and dents. Please look at the pictures. There is also a bit of fret wear, but it does not yet affect playability. If you have any questions please ask! I will ship safely and securely within 1 business day!
