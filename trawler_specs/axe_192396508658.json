{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A good guitar of the Soviet Union was produced by the Borisov factory of musical instruments in the period roughly from 1974 to 1982. The body of the guitar is completely similar to the Rostov Aelita. The guitar body is made of beech-spruce plywood. The bar is fixed to the body with four bolts. Mechanical tremolo and bridge, similar to the Czechoslovak Iolans. The standard is 650 mm. The electrical part is simple and reliable. Working electronics. The neck of the guitar is flat - a vintage original sound. The guitar has remained well. For a collector just a godsend. If you work with it, you can use it on stage. When sending the neck is removed from the body for safety. I'm waiting for questions, I can send additional photo.", "ItemID": "192396508658", "EndTime": "2019-02-06T12:13:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2017-12-13T12:13:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rhythm-Solo-Borisov-AELITA-USSR-Rare-Vintage-Electric-Guitar-Soviet-Russian-/192396508658", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Irkutsk, Irkutskaya oblast", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1923965086588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aXwAAOSwOA1aMRi4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/apEAAOSwvApaMRjF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/alMAAOSwWv5aMRjS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qYEAAOSwmudaMRjd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N4IAAOSwnTdaMRjr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uZ0AAOSwzRlaMRj5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J-EAAOSwc2FaMRkF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dn0AAOSwkLhaMRkT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/okAAAOSwyXNaMRkg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OeYAAOSwrsZaMRku/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/obsAAOSwHNxaMRk7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ranger111058", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 293, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT9H52M23S", "Title": "Rhythm-Solo \"Borisov AELITA\" USSR Rare Vintage Electric Guitar Soviet Russian", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Aelita"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Russian Federation"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1974"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Aelita"]}]}, "HitCount": 1395, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "RU", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The guitar, released in the 70s of the last century, has signs of wear.
