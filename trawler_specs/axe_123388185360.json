{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2002 LTD MV-100 solid body electric guitar, in very good overall condition. Made in Korea. Plays and sounds great! Upgraded with two Duncan Designed pickups, one hot rail style single coil in the neck position, one humbucker in the bridge. 3-way toggle switch, 1 volume 1 tone control. The electronics work as they should. Basswood body, maple neck. In good shape structurally, no cracks or breaks anywhere. Very few scratches and dings. Black paint is mostly very glossy, has a few spots here and there where the gloss is rubbed off a little bit. Mostly around the pickups and the controls. Just looks like it's been played a little bit. Had it set up and restrung professionally recently. Action is good. Comes in a very cheesy gig bag. Please use eBay's shipping calculator to figure shipping costs to where you are. I'm sorry, due to the silly CITES restrictions, I will be unable to ship internationally. Sorry, I truly hate that. Please write with any questions you may have. Satisfaction is guaranteed, or you can return for a full, no-hassle refund. Thanks very much for looking at this listing!", "ItemID": "123388185360", "EndTime": "2019-02-22T00:26:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-25T00:26:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2002-LTD-MV-100-electric-guitar-Seymour-Duncans-good-condition-rocks-/123388185360", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Ottawa, Kansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1233881853608080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/XeMAAOSwiqdbqXlo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/~sMAAOSwbD5bqXmK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4OTc=/z/-94AAOSww0xbqXmo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/upIAAOSwoYFbqXm~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/yakAAOSwdPBbqXnV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4OYAAOSwe~BbqXnm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4OTk=/z/mHUAAOSw0c9bqXn-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/IDkAAOSwS1VbqXoR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "66067", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "marker58", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1368, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 165.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 165.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P17DT3H19M7S", "Title": "2002 LTD MV-100 electric guitar, Seymour Duncans, good condition, rocks!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["MV100"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 861, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
