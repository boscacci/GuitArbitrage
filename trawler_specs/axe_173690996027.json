{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here we have an Ibanex GIO GRX 45 model. Original black knobs have been replaced with gun metal grey ones. 22 frets, stock pickups - 1 humbucker and 2 single coils. 5 way selector switch and volume and tone knobs. This is definetly a beginner guitar, and was the guitar I first learned on 15+ years ago (for what that's worth). Buy it at a fair price for your kid who is just starting out. Some very small scratches and dings. Most notably the area behind the bridge where a sticker was scraped off, however it is hardly noticeable in regular light at a short distance. The \"GIO\" on the headstock was blacked out with a sharpie to make it look a bit classier. Nice looking without busting the bank. It is a comfortable guitar and plays well enough for what it is, a great learning guitar. Frets are not worn down at all, never been filed and have a LOT of life left in them. Works good. Includes a whammy bar. Free shipping to the lower 48. Will ship very securely..! No returns. Thanks for looking..!", "ItemID": "173690996027", "EndTime": "2019-02-12T12:01:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T12:01:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-GRX-45-Electric-Guitar-Beginner-/173690996027", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pelham, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736909960278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/HnQAAOSwRUdboG9o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/XcAAAOSwq6pboG9u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/Ov8AAOSw1WtboG9v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/eYkAAOSw0NlboG9x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/d~QAAOSwB8tboG9y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/bJUAAOSwA71boG90/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/sZIAAOSwAzZboG92/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "10803", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hellvomitor", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 661, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 130.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 130.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P7DT14H53M1S", "Title": "Ibanez GRX 45 Electric Guitar Beginner", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["GRX20JB", "GRX20ZJB"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["GRX20JB"]}]}, "HitCount": 218, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78626576", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
