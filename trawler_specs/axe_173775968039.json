{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Please READ entire ad, see pics for condition, and ask ALL questions BEFORE purchase! Thanks! For sale here is my 1984 Peavey Patriot guitar with a red finish. 100% American made goodness, Peavey puts out some killer gear that would cost hundreds more if a different name was on the headstock. The Super Ferrite pickup sounds incredible in the neck and the upgraded EMG 81 in the bridge absolutely screams! Has quite a few dings, scratches, some chips around the edges but nothing that affects playability. Also, a piece cracked out of the pickguard but has been glued back together. No case, whammy bar or backplate. Please don't hesitate to ask any and all questions that you may have or for more pictures BEFORE you buy and I will get back to you immediately. There are absolutely no refunds on this guitar, so please be sure of your purchase before you Buy Now or make an offer. Guitar will be shipped fully insured and packed like a beast.
