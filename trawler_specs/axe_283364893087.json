{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "VINTAGE DANELECTRO MADE SILVERTONE 1448 GUITAR Up for bids is a vintage Silvertone by Danelectro electric guitar. This is the single pickup model that usually comes with the famous case with built in amp (I don't have the case, just the guitar). It has the original black with silver sparkle finish, and someone has added some cool looking neon paint streaks and splatters. I think this is the type of paint that sort of glows under blacklight, but I don't have a blacklight to check. Aside from the knobs the guitar appears to be all original. It shows assorted small nicks and dings and weather checking but no cracks or repairs. There is some wear to the paint on the heard (see close up photos). The original 'skate key' tuners have a lot of oxidation but still work as they should. The neck is straight with easy playing action. Frets show a little wear but have plenty of life left. The pickup has good output. I did notice that when you turn the volume knob the sound will cut out at one spot about halfway up then it works again as you turn it up. It comes with a non-original gig bag. Look at the photos above to see the condition before bidding. U.S. shipping will be $50 (more to Alaska and Hawaii) No international shipping.", "ItemID": "283364893087", "EndTime": "2019-02-11T03:13:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-04T03:13:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1960s-Silvertone-Danelectro-1448-Electric-Guitar-Lipstick-Tube-Pickup-/283364893087", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Maryville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833648930878080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzg0WDEyNTU=/z/fGsAAOSwMkdcV4iB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODI1WDEyMzY=/z/ztAAAOSwYYpcV4iI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA3WDEwNzE=/z/TLsAAOSwOShcV4iL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzg5WDEyMjE=/z/JxoAAOSwzEVcV4iU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzExWDEwOTM=/z/n2YAAOSwmE9cV4ic/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQxWDExNTY=/z/i2sAAOSwiz1cV4iY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDEyNTk=/z/QaIAAOSw7C5cV4iO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzM5WDExMDQ=/z/emEAAOSwLnRcV4iR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODIwWDEyMjk=/z/vbEAAOSwXFRcV4iE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "arbennett", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3289, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 249.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 249.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P6DT8H26M23S", "Title": "1960's Silvertone Danelectro 1448 Electric Guitar - With Lipstick Tube Pickup", "HitCount": 98, "Subtitle": "Original Finish with Wild Neon Paint Added", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1505248", "StoreName": "arbennett"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
