Shipping to the lower 48 states only.I will not ship anywhere else.Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Slammer by Hamer Cherry Sunburst Double Cutaway Flame Top with some nice upgrades. The guitar has Grover tuners. I changed out the stock humbuckers for some Black/Cream Zebra 4 wire humbuckers, bridge is an Epiphone pickup and the neck is an Artec but they match perfectly. Then I added a push/pull tone control so that the humbuckers can be split into single coils. Along with the three way switch this gives you six different pickup combinations. I also upgraded the stock capacitor with a nice .022uf Orange Drop style epoxy film capacitor. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. All the electronics work perfectly and guitar sounds great. Neck shows zero fret wear. The body looks great, just mild surface scratches. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great.
