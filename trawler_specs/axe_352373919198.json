{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my opening statement. I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Steadman Pro guitar with a few nice upgrades. The bound rosewood 22 fret neck is a medium c shape with zero fret wear,Grover style diecast tuners. The Metallic Blue body is full thickness and looks great ,but it has some indentations,a couple of dark marks on the back,and rub marks. There is also hairline cracks at both sides of the control cavity,other than those flaws just light surface scratches. Control cavity cover has a round mark on it. I upgraded the pickups with some fully covered hot Black/Cream Zebra pickups I had. I also upgraded the tone capacitor with a nice Orange Drop style .022uf epoxy film cap. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound very good on this guitar. A very sexy looking guitar. Action is good and guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too. Guitar is quite heavy. This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
