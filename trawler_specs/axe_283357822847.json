We have found it impossible to describe every mark on an instrument or amp that is not in the \"mint\" category. Also, what's important to you may not be important to someone else. For example, you may say, \"I don't care what it looks like as long as it plays or sounds well.\" Another person may say, \"Body cosmetics are very important to me so tell me about every scratch, nick and blemish.\" So, please ask the questions that are most important to you. If you ask, they will be answered. They are free and there's no limit. Additional photos can also be made available. This is a specific item that is also being offered for sale in our brick & mortar location. It is possible that it has just been sold. Please ask if it is still available before purchasing. *It is our policy to require a signature on delivery of all musical instruments. Please let us know if you prefer no signature required when ordering or we will automatically require a signature.
