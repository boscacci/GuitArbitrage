Available for auction from Washburn is the Steve Stevens SS40-B electric guitar. This guitar was made in Korea from 1992 until 1996. The Washburn SS40 is one of Washburn's Steve Stevens signature models. It is a superstrat with similar specs to the US made SS-80 and SS-100 models, except with Washburn Eliminator pickups and a 600-S Floyd Rose type bridge. This guitar plays great and sounds even better and comes with a Road Runner hardshell case. Cosmetically the guitar does show some wear from age and use, see pics for more details. Also, the whammy bar, pickup selector switch and the middle locking nut are not original. Feel free to ask any questions, good luck and happy bidding.
