{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "\"Tonic\" is one of the first truly mass models of the Soviet Union. This guitar was released at a factory in Sverdlovsk. The rarity of this guitar is that it is painted red when manufactured. All Tonika electric guitars in the USSR were painted exclusively in black. The deck is made of traditional beech-based furniture and is covered with polyester varnish. Beech neck, three, with hermetic, uncontrolled wall anchors on the body with two screws for fastening the plate. The standard hole is 650 mm. Kolka, typical for acoustic guitar, 1x6, silumin with bars, mounted vertically without sleeves. The scheme is quite simple and works. The guitar has signs of wear. The guitar is in working order, but it is more of a museum piece than a tool on stage. This guitar is equipped with an additional jack plug, for connection to the amplifier, that would not have problems with the connection.When sent, the neck is separated from the body.
