{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "GOD I HATE IOWA WINTERS SALE: Up for auction is a beautiful Valley Arts Custom Pro Shop, designed for Samick, stratocaster. USA made Valley Arts strats go for thousands of $$$. This guitar is patterned off those high end Valley Arts, USA made strats. These awesome, quality guitars were made in Korea and are equal, or even better, than any of the Korean made PRS SE and higher end Asian and Mexican Squires. Way, way better than any of the Samicks that are currently made in China and Indonesia. If I am reading the serial number correctly, this guitar dates to 1999. The body is made out of alder with a maple neck. The see through sunburst finish is stunning,with no finish checking whatsoever. The white pearloid pickguard looks great. The slim neck is made out of maple, has some mild flame, and plays fast. Frets are good. The guitar shows little wear and you might think it was new. For what its worth, I believe the guitar is stock. That's the way it was sold to me. All electronics function properly. It is missing the trem arm, but you can pick one up on ebay for not much $$$. It didn't come with a case when I bought it, so guess what, you won't be getting one either. Since there is no case, here is what I'm going to do and it will cut down on shipping costs. I will remove the strings and take the neck off. Both the body and neck will be bubble wrapped and packed securely and I will insure everything. Keeping the guitar together would require a larger box and the shipping companies all charge as if the shipment weighed 60 - 70 pounds. All you will have to do is reattach the neck and then put on the strings you like to use. I've had many guitars shipped this way to me. It works fine and you will save on shipping costs. Lots of info online and there are some you tube videos out there as well. Check that out. I have other guitar related equipment listed please check my other auctions out. Thanks. Shipping cost listed is for anything shipped within the USA. Alaska and Hawaii might be more, so if you are from either of those states please don't pay until you get an invoice. I've shipped guitars, amps and effects world-wide, so if you live outside of the USA, I do use ebay's Global Shipping service exclusively. Please check to see if you are eligible to use that service. Thanks. Some additional info I found online: American Classic Series The American Classic Series was introduced in 1993 as a collaboration between Samick and the Valley Arts Custom Pro Shop, after Samick purchased half of Valley Arts in 1992. While the founders of Valley Arts quickly became dissatisfied with their positions at Samick and left, production continued until Gibson bought out Valley Arts in 2002.. By May 1993, the new Valley Arts headstock appeared. All American Classic Series models were made in Incheon, Korea by Samick.", "ItemID": "273677919408", "EndTime": "2019-02-06T00:44:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T00:44:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samick-Valley-Arts-Custom-Pro-Shop-American-Classic-Series-Stratocaster-EX-/273677919408", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Iowa City, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736779194088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MlgzNjE=/z/fAIAAOSw8bpcUJBe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExMlg0Mjk=/z/fEUAAOSw8bpcUJCu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1Mlg2NTQ=/z/20AAAOSwXepcUJEQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1M1g0MDE=/z/uEMAAOSwcOZcUJFj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3Nlg0MTc=/z/SQEAAOSwgB5cUJGv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4OVg4NDM=/z/1YoAAOSwxoJcUJII/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQ2WDQ1Mw==/z/nN8AAOSwXINcUJJX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52240", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mountmercyguy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1623, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 170.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 170.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT22H30M32S", "Title": "Samick Valley Arts Custom Pro Shop American Classic Series Stratocaster - EX+", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Samick"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["American Classic Series Stratocater"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["American Classic Series Valley Arts Design"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 236, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 170.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar functions and sounds awesome.
