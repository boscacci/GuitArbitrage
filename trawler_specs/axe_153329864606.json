{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1960\u2019s Japanese made Teisco guitar with 2 Goldfoil pickups. This guitar has been played hard, and played a lot! It's got mileage on it. Action is medium, and bridge can be lowered a bit more (see pics). Both pickups work and sound awesome. These are the goldfoils made famous by David Lindley. Switches and pots have been cleaned with contact cleaner. Neck is fat and is pretty straight with enough relief for playing. There is no truss rod. Everything looks original to me, but please study the pics carefully. Look, this is an old guitar and it's got the usual battle scars for a 50+ year old guitar - bumps, dings, finish checking etc. I try to be honest with my description, but If you're a whiner, please look elsewhere. This is an old guitar with a lot of wear and tear on it. Please study the pics carefully, what you see is what you get. Ask any questions before bidding. Guaranteed to work and be as stated here, but sold \"as-is\". I am not a store, just a guy with too much stuff, so no returns on this please. I've tried to be as honest as I can about the condition. It's a great little guitar, especially for a 60's instrument. ============================== PayPal only. Continental US only. I reserve the right not to sell to anyone with NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, and those with ZERO FEEDBACK need to contact me first before bidding OR THEIR BIDS MAY BE CANCELLED.
