{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is very solid but it does have wear. There is finish checking and dings here and there. I did try to get pictures of all of it. Look closely at the pictures and you will find them. Other that that it plays great! The neck feels good and the pickups sound good! For sale is my Samick FA-2TR Tele, a signature series designed by Greg Bennet. This is a very cool instrument, and is loaded with high end features, such as the Grover tuners. Just set up with .010's. The Samick company is based out of Korea. They have made guitars for Gibson and Fender in the past, as well as many other large companies. Foto- flame body finish is beautiful, pictures cannot capture it. The maple neck is smooth and comfortable to play. I would describe the neck as thick and wide, with a flat fretboard radius.", "ItemID": "233120318289", "EndTime": "2019-02-10T18:06:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-03T18:06:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samick-Tele-Style-Greg-Bennet-Signature-Model-Electric-Guitar-FA-2-/233120318289", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Effingham, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331203182898080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6XAAAOSwOShcO3q7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iFgAAOSwKOZcO3sv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ISYAAOSwXgxcO3t9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/v0cAAOSwAEFcO3up/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kR0AAOSwpppcO3vP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MKgAAOSwa3FcO3v9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D58AAOSwkAxcO3wl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JJ0AAOSw5xhcO3xU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yCkAAOSwTflcO3yC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/j6wAAOSwRfxcO3yk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MDYAAOSwjmRcO3zd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~wMAAOSwjfdcO30l/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "62401", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chesnutfamilymusic09", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 101, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P5DT22H58M2S", "Title": "Samick Tele Style Greg Bennet Signature Model Electric Guitar FA-2 ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Samick"]}]}, "HitCount": 50, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 149.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
