{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "$60 SHIPPING IS FOR THE CONTIGUOUS USA ONLY...SEE MY OTHER AUCTION FOR ANOTHER SUPER COOL RARE POINTY METAL GUITAR. Selling this very rare 2001 Epiphone \"DEMON\" 6-string electric guitar. Production was limited to only 1000 units worldwide, serial number for this one is U01051222. Color is metallic black, and has an upgraded locking nut. This guitar is in exceptionally good condition with only one tiny ding on the upper backside corner ( see photo with ink pen tip comparison ). What is even more rare is to find one of these guitars with the original case which is included with this guitar. The case has it's fair share of scuffs, scrapes, and wear marks but it serves its purpose and all latches are in tack and properly working. This guitar is from the hard to find E-series which was made in Korea with inspection/setup done in Nashville, TN. Epiphone only produced the Demon V between 2001 and 2002. It has a modified V-shaped solid hardwood body, with a shorter lower horn. The bolt on maple neck has a slim-taper profile,\u00a0Indian\u00a0rosewood fingerboard with a satin finish. Has a tune-o-matic bridge with strings through body, and two E-series Ultra-Hot humbucking pickups (neck pickup DC resistance: 12 k\u03a9, bridge pickup DC resistance:16 k\u03a9). This Demon is the E-Series take on a classic Randy Rhoads V, and is from the Hard Body Series. Here is your chance to get a guitar that very few other collectors have. It will be packed and shipped with the greatest of care. Please do not hesitate to ask questions. If you would like more photos just ask and I will make sure you get them.
