{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Distortion, Chorus, Tremolo, and Reverb all contained within the guitar's own control panel, along with the standard volume, tone, and pick up selector. It's true, it's fun! The built in distortion lets you control its level of gain and tone quality with 2 knobs (Careful!! The level is WAY hot compared to normal - turn the volume down before kicking it in). The tremolo can be dialed to different rates from helicopter to slow waves with a knob. The chorus and reverb (slapback style) are on/off presets. Each button turns on or off an effect. You can use any combination you want, all of them at once, or none. There are 2 separate outputs, one bypassing the effects and one for guitar + onboard effects. If you are familiar with Danelectro's budget effects pedals, this is similar - not high end by any means, but surprisingly good for cheap. Oh right, the guitar itself! It actually plays well, not a toy! It has been set up and all adjustments work as they should. The frets were leveled, and the intonation set. Basic Strat style setup. The neck is comfortable and better quality than I expected. The pickups are okay, what you'd expect at this price point. With all the extra circuitry, it was above my pay grade to upgrade them, but they work fine as is. No real issues. Just a few nicks here and there. The blue sparkle finish is clean and shiny, eye-catching. I found the back cover after I took the photos. That and the battery cover will be reattached before shipping. Weighs 7lbs 13 ounces. 25\" scale length. Does not come with a stand or case. I have a few cases available for an extra charge - just let me know what you're looking for and I'll see if I have it. I'm happy to answer any questions. I'm mainly a bass player but I'm familiar enough with guitars to give extra info if I can. Thanks for looking, and check out my other auctions!", "ItemID": "264176017258", "EndTime": "2019-02-09T03:39:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-02T03:39:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Danelectro-Innuendo-Guitar-4-Built-in-Effects-FUN-/264176017258", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Sedona, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641760172588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg4MjU=/z/o-UAAOSwh7tcJuFZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1Mlg3NTc=/z/i-UAAOSwtcRcJuL9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMVg4OTE=/z/R58AAOSw~sJcJuG1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/lF8AAOSwjoFcJuIi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2NjA=/z/zdQAAOSwjfpcJuOM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3NTI=/z/oLkAAOSwPGtcJuJP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/uagAAOSwGYhcJuKW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3OVg4NjM=/z/h2AAAOSwxHlcJuH5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/kNcAAOSwQ5pcJuMd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3Njg=/z/Zt0AAOSwgotcJuLS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DFQAAOSw6PxcJuNN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/uaAAAOSw8fRcJuHM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "86336", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "malexandering", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 340, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 215.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 215.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P4DT8H30M25S", "Title": "Danelectro Innuendo Guitar with 4 Built-in Effects = FUN!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Danelectro"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Built-in Effects"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 16, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=463900667", "StoreName": "PluckandBow"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 215.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
