Crafted from sapele and mahogany, this semi-hollow beauty sounds great even unplugged!Gorgeous Semi-Hollowbody Tone for an Unbelievable Price! The Ibanez AS53 Artcore semi-hollowbody electric guitar boasts a classic design in a thinline shape that's an absolute pleasure to play. The Artcore AS53's sapele body provides warm, resonant tone, with a sturdy mahogany set neck spanning 22 frets over a smooth rosewood fingerboard. A pair of ACH-ST humbuckers captures each string for a tone that'll leave your ears hungry for more. Take advantage of your volume and tone controls to shape the texture of your output. This Ibanez Artcore axe proves that you can get serious playability, attractive looks, and warm semi-hollowbody tone -- on a budget.Attractive Sapele Body The sapele top on your AS53 Artcore is easy on the eyes. Its charming linear grain pattern contrasts nicely against the dark color of each humbucker as well as the light-colored binding. Sonically, sapele yields a resonance similar to mahogany -- a nice push on the lows and mids, yet sapele brings in a little more brightness. That extra treble zing can come in handy for when you want your output to cut through the mix a little more. And with this set-neck semi-hollow tone machine, you'll never be short on sustain.Sturdy Mahogany Neck Take your fingers for a spin down this guitar's sturdy and resonant mahogany neck. The Artcore neck shape is a comfortable fit, and each of this appendage's 22 frets harnesses a comfortable action for each finger to enjoy. A smooth and buttery rosewood fingerboard welcomes each fingertip for a melodic ride that feels just as great as it sounds. If you've never shouldered a semi-hollowbody guitar before, then the slim Ibanez AS53 Artcore is a great place to start.Set of ACH-ST Humbuckers Nestled in this axe's sapele body are a set of Infinity R (H) pick ups. Each pickup is designed to capture all of the warmth, depth, and resonance of each note without any buzz, hums, or other unwanted noise. The sapele body and mahogany neck tend to yield a darker tone, so tweak your tone control to brighten things up if you're looking for a sound with more high end. The Ibanez AS53 is long on versatility -- and for the price, you really can't go wrong!Features - Artcore AS Mahogany Set-In Neck - Sapele Wood Body - Fingerboard: Bound Laurel fretboard w/White dot inlay - Medium frets - Bridge: ART-ST bridge - ART-ST Tailpiece - Neck Pickup: Infinity R (H) neck pickup (Passive/Ceramic) - Bridge Pickup: Infinity R (H) bridge pickup (Passive/Ceramic) - Strings: .010/.013/.017/.026/.036/.046 - Chrome HardwareNeck Dimensions - Scale: 628mm/24.7\" - Width at Nut 43mm - Width at Last Fret 57mm - Thickness at 1st 21mm - Thickness at 12th 24mm (at 9F) - Radius: 305mm Our in-house guitar tech has inspect, test, set up, and cleaned all of our instruments on site prior to shipping.
