{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a 2006 Yamaha RGX121Z electric guitar in a sparkly Metallic Burgundy color. This guitar is a great player with powerful humbuckers with a good single coil pickup in the middle giving lots of sound options. The ohms on the 2 humbuckers both measure close to 12.5. Ohms on th single coil measure 5.75. The frets have just a few wear spots on the first three frets that don\u2019t affect play. Electronics work as they should with a 5 position switch. Solid Nato body with a maple neck and rosewood fretboard weighs in at about 7 1/2 pounds. Fretboard is cleaned and oiled, fresh set of Ernie Ball Super Slinkys, trusses rod adjusted, intonation adjusted, pickup heights adjusted, action low and fast. The harmonics are ringing nicely and sustain is excellent. Tuners work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune. I can get em playing and sounding good but I haven\u2019t got the tools for a good fret leveling or filing. That operation would get this one playing perfectly. I feel it plays and sounds good enough to perform with the way it is, a very good Yamaha.... This is a used guitar that has nicks, dings, scuffs, and scratches but still presents nicely. Check out my pictures carefully and please ask any questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed. Sale of this item is intended to be final, I try very hard to describe accurately. Our feedback and seller rating is there for you to check out. I sell the guitar stuff.
