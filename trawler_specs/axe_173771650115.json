{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is the JS32-8 model in satin black with the \"piranha\" fret markers, it is in NEAR-NEW condition (I can't put this in the title, by eBay rules, no matter how true it is), probably less than 100 hours of playing time from the feel and look of it. From the 2016 Jackson catalog: Get superior Jackson build and performance in our most affordable family of models\u2014JS Series Dinky guitars. Fine features include archtop designs, (...my elision, this isn't the quilted-top model), basswood bodies, high output ceramic-magnet pickups, graphite-reinforced maple necks, compound radius bound fngerboards and headstocks and black hardware. Plays, sounds, and looks GREAT.
