{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a First Act model ME-1972. Add a tone control and two nice knobs and you could have a rocker for cheap. This is an easy guitar to play with a double cut-away, one volume knob and a hardtail bridge. Tone would be controlled at the amp. This is a solid piece weighing in at a little over 8 pounds. Maple neck , rosewood fretboard, nice meaty frets with little to no wear, very comfortable slender straight neck....this guitar would be a good candidate to \u201chot-rod.\u201d There is plenty of room to add a tone control. The stock pickup is actually fairly hot registering 8.81 on the ohmmeter. Hot single pickup, good intonation, hardtail, and solid wood add up to good sustain and singing distortion. This guitar has been cleaned up, fretboard oiled, intonation adjusted, string height adjusted low, electronics work as they should, tuners are also in working order. Guitar has been lightly used with a small ding or two, a few light scratches and a few light scuffs on the back and sides. Guitar presents very nicely. Check out pictures and ask questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed. Sale is intended to be final. Check our seller rating and feedback, I sell the guitar stuff and ship promptly and carefully. Thanks for considering.", "ItemID": "173774927505", "EndTime": "2019-02-07T21:30:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-02T21:30:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FIRST-ACT-ME-1972-READY-MOD-/173774927505", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bettendorf, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737749275058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N0AAAOSwB19cBroW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Mr8AAOSw1jpcBrta/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I2AAAOSwnfRcBrtg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aicAAOSwEONcBrtk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uWkAAOSwtmNcBrtq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MZ8AAOSwYd5cBrtv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/u-0AAOSwLSZcBrt2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gnwAAOSwHhFcBrt7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xdgAAOSwiE1cBruC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QC4AAOSwUVFcBruI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o2AAAOSwa3lcBruQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-nkAAOSw-iZcBrs3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mychildren5-2008", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2015, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 39.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 39.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P3DT59M22S", "Title": "FIRST ACT ME-1972 READY TO MOD.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["First Act"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ME -1972"]}]}, "HitCount": 12, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=847815792", "StoreName": "Bargain Charlie&#39;s"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good used condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
