{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1970s MIJ Teisco HR Sound Stratocaster Guitar Matsumoku Black Maple 7 Pounds Not a cheapy Strat clone. Well made solid rocker! Japanese maple high quality husk and electronics The guitar plays well, intonation is low. The electronics, switches, picks ups and everything works as it should. Not much else to say about this guitar. This particular example is in overall wonderful cosmetic condition for a 40+ year old guitar. Overall the guitar is in very good condition, and there are a handful of random small superficial dings on the entire guitar. Very loud guitar that sounds amazing through any decent amplifier. As with any guitar that\u2019s been sitting in storage it going to need new strings and set up. Please consider this when bidding on my items. Its vintage folks and anything this old will need a minor tune up.Shipping, Payment & Important Details. Your item will be shipped immediately after I receive payment.
