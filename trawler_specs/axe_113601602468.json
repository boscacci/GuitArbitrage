{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Selling my beautiful Ibanez S470 with the Wizard II ULTRA thin neck and a thin lightweight body to match. One of the best guitars I've ever owned! Unfortunately I'm moving and need to sell it. Upgraded the bottom pickup to a EMG HZ. Missing middle singlecoil and knob tops Please look at pictures as it's got some normal wear from use over the years. Most notably a chip on the headstock and some scratches. From Wiki:The S470 is an S series solid body electric guitar model introduced by Ibanez in 2003. It is the third distinct model to carry the S470 name after a Japanese-made model introduced in 1992 and another Korean model introduced in 1995. The S470 features a mahogany body bolted to a maple Wizard II neck with a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard with \"S wave\" position markers. Components include Ibanez pickups with a pair of humbuckers flanking a single-coil and a ZR double locking tremolo bridge which debuted in this model. The S470 originally had Powersound pickups, those were replaced by Infinity pickups in 2005. The S470 was updated in 2008 with new inlays and an altered tremolo system. Later in 2008, production moved form Korea to Indonesia. The S470DX is an extremely similar model that was offered in 2003 and 2004; the only apparent differences between the two models are slightly different fretboard position markers and the fretboard binding on the DX model. The S470B is a similar model with black hardware This item is sold As-Described Product SpecsCondition:(Used)Brand:IbanezModel:S Series S470 6-String Electric Guitar EMG HZ UpgradeFinish:BlueCategories:Solid BodyYear:2004-2006", "ItemID": "113601602468", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T00:01:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-28T00:01:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-S-Series-S470-400-6-String-Electric-Guitar-Blue-Floyd-Rose-EMG-HZ-Wizard2-/113601602468", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Huntington Beach, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136016024688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTg3WDI5OQ==/z/fMQAAOSwpzRcTkRV/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzMxWDYxNQ==/z/MRgAAOSwj9hcTkS1/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzI0WDU1OA==/z/~8MAAOSwcXhcTkS5/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzk1WDYyNw==/z/1N8AAOSwC~9cTkS6/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "92646", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fullforcehifi", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 105, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P22DT4H53M24S", "Title": "Ibanez S Series S470 400 6-String Electric Guitar Blue Floyd Rose EMG HZ Wizard2", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["S470"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["DiMarzio"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 927, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1380360209", "StoreName": "Full Force HiFi"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Please look at pictures as it's got some normal wear from use over the years.
