Online General Description below:This plain top Epiphone Les Paul Standard is an electric guitar that delivers all the signature sound of a Gibson Les Paul at a fraction of the cost. The mahogany body provides superb resonance while the Alnico Classic humbucker pickups deliver loads of warmth.

The LockTone Tune-O-Matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece provide more sustain and string changing easier. Okay...
