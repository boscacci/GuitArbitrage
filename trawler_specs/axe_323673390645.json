{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "BuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 320.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "Description": "Squier Vintage Modified Thinline Tele - Natural. Condition is incredible. Exceptionally nice/clean/\"pampered\" ;-)One tiny flaw on back where finish got \u201cpoked\u201d. It was there when I bought it. I am 2nd owner.This is only a surface flaw and does not effect the playability or the tone/sound of the guitar in any way.Apart from that little flaw, the guitar looks like brand new. Been WELL cared for. Always cleaned/polished regularly. (Note: In photo #1, it looks like finish might be rubbed off bottom right edge of guitar. This is NOT the case. It is only a reflection. Finish is beautiful.) I changed the pick guard out for black, but still have perfect condition white pearl pick guard as shown in photo. Will include the white (original factory) one. It is currently wearing the black one.Will also include an unused Ernie Ball nylon strap. (Strap is burgundy color w/black leather button holes)Newer strings. Ernie Ball 9\u2019s I think(?)The guitar has never been on tours at all. Only played in my studio or other \"non hostile\" environments :-D. Ready to play and enjoy as is unless you want it set up differently. Great action. Fast \u201cC\u201d neck.Fit / Finish / Hardware are a \u201c10.\u201d This is an exceptional, extraordinary, and versatile guitar. The Fender Humbuckers are SWEET, and the 3-way switch gives you tons of tonal options.Body is Ash with maple neck and fretboard Any/all questions welcome. These are not so common to find in this condition, at this price . . . and with TWO pick guard options!! Bid with confidence. You will not be disappointed with this guitar. **** I must reserve the right to end auction at anytime because guitar is being offered locally as well. Guitar will be securely wrapped and nicely padded for safe travel to any of the 48 N.American states. Thank you for looking! Happy bidding!!!!
