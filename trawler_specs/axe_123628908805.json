{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "THIS ONE IS A DEVLIN DV-400. ITS THEIR COPY OF THE GIBSON LES PAUL CUSTOM. IT IS MADE OF THE SAME WOODS AND THE SAME SIZE. IT PLAYS AND FEELS LIKE A REAL LES PAUL SHOULD. IT HAS A GORGEOUS SUNBURST FINISH. THE ORIGINAL HUMBUCKERS WERE REMOVED. THEY WERE JUST TOO MUDDY WITH NO DEFINITION. IT IS NOW LOADED WITH A SET OF CUSTOM WOUND ALNICO V HUMBUCKERS. THESE ARE WOUND TO THE SAME SPECS AS THE SEYMOUR DUNCAN 59 SET. BUT THESE HAVE A MORE PRONOUINCED BOTTOM END AND SLIGHTLY SMOOTHER HIGHS AND UPPER MIDS. BELIEVE ME, THESE ARE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT. THEY ARE RUN THROUGH INDIVIDUAL PUSH/PULL VOLUME POTS. WHEN PULLED, THEY WILL RUN THE HUMBUCKERS IN SERIES(HUMBUCKER TONE) OR PARALLEL( FILTERTRON TONE). SO YOU CAN GET THE THICK CLASSIC LES PAUL TONE OR THE JANGLY TONES, ALL WITH NO 60 CYCLE HUM. THE GUITAR IS STILL IN EXCELLENT SHAPE, BUT IT DOES HAVE A FEW SMALL BLEMISHES. THE FRETS WERE JUST POLISHES AND THE FRETBOARD OILED. IT HAS GREAT LOW EVEN ACTION. THE ARCH TOP HARD CASE IS ALSO IN SHAPE, BUT DOES HAVE SOME MINOR WEAR. THERE IS ALSO SOME STICKER RESIDUE. I WASNT SURE HOW TO REMOVE IT WITHOUT DAMAGINMG THE TOLEX. SO I JUST LEFT IT. THE GUITAR IS WELL SET UP WITH ERNIE BALL 10-46 STRINGS. WITH THE MODS AND SET UP, THIS ONE WILL WAY OUTPERFORM THE EPI STANDARDS OR CUSTOMS. I WILL TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SHIPPING IS TO THE CONT. US ONLY. ALASKA, HAWAII, AND P.R. WILL BE MORE. I WILL ONLY SHIP INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH EBAYS GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. PLEASE MAKE PAYMENT OR CONTACT WITH ME WITHIN 72 HOURS OF WINNING.
