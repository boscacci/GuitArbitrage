{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The guitar is overall in great condition. It has some scratches and light buckle rash, but they are not very noticeable with the darkwood finish. Please view pictures for detail, as I try my best to capture any/all defects as best as I can. The guitar was completely dissembled,cleaned, polished, and buffed. The guitar received a complete setup to include new strings. Here are the features from the Peavey Patriot Operating Guide:The select maple neck is of a unique bi-laminate construction to provide unmatched rigidity and freedom from warpage. The instrument features a \u201cfull\u201d scale lengthwith is 23 3/4\u201d with 23 frets. The arch of the fingerboard is on a 12\u201d radius to allow excellent string bending characteristics without the buzzing and fretting-out problems. The body is made from the finest hand selected hardwood which is finished in a dark natural color. Two single-coil high performance pickups provide both high power and full-range operations. One Master Volume Control, and one master Tone Control. The fully articulated 13 gauge steel bridge is triple chrome plated and utilizes 3/8\u201d solid steel saddles. The Three-position selector switch determines which pickup is operational (neck, both, bridge). This allows for a rhythm, lead, or humbucking configuration.
