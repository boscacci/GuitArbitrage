{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx only,no post office boxes .I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone Les Paul Junior in a Gloss Black finish with some nice upgrades. First I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. Neck is great with near zero fret wear. There are some small grain of rice size indentations on the front,otherwise just mild surface scratches.Guitar looks like a classic. Then I replaced capacitor with an high quality axial film capacitor. Sometimes I change the caps and I don't hear a big difference, this time the change was quite noticable. Sounded very full on clean tones and has a nice snarl once you add some gain. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. I replaced the cheapie closed back tuners and installed vintage looking Kluson Style Tuners,[you can still see some of the holes left from the old tuner screw holes on the back of the headstock.]These tuners came frome from China so don't believe the logos on the back. I also replaced the control knobs with some more vintage looking bell knobs. Guitar plays,looks,and sounds great! A classy looking guitar that wants to kick some butt. Guitar looks great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea of the condition. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
