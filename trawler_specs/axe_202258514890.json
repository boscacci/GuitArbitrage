The fretboard is rich and dark which also gives an excellent contrast to the shine of the highly detailed pearloid inlays. This guitar has two Stellar OSR humbucker pickups. These pickups give the guitar long sustains that sound excellent with a classic tone that is exactly what you would expect from this kind of guitar. The D-Shape slimline neck is as fast as you are.
