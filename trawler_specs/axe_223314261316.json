{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is a very nice looking and nice playing les Paul shaped guitar. This is a MVG (Miami Vintage guitars) Custom LP Eclipse. This guitar is a blue-green burst with a solid maple top, TOM bridge and tailpiece, Gotoh sealed tuners and MVG Hot fully covered humbuckers. There is plastic still on the truss rod cover and back plate. This guitar is number 336. This guitar has never been gigged and is from a smoke free home. This guitar hung on my wall and cleaned weekly. There are a few very light scratches on the back. There is a small finish blemish by the back of the neck near the pocket. Please see pics. I am only selling to downsize. The guitar is bone stock and has a great sound. The pickups are very full and thick with a nice blend of mid and treble. They have moderate gain. I plate through a Mesa dual rectifier and an Orange crush 60c and it sounds amazing through both amps. It plays and sounds much nicer than many epiphone les Paul\u2019s that I have owned/played. Shipping is free in the 48 US only. Insurance will be included. Please note it costs me 25-50 dollars to ship with USPS. Please keep that in mind when submitting offers \ud83d\ude01 I will include a gig bag and will loosen the strings to alleviate neck tension during shipping. Please ask any questions that you may have.
