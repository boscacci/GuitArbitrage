{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you are wanting a floyd rose style guitar with decent upgrades, tonal versatility, that stays in tune really well, and is right around $200, then this ESP could be a great guitar for you. The frets have minimal wear and the truss rod is full functional. The action is really nice and low. Minimal fret buzz. The floyd stays in tune really well with both dive bombs and up pulls. This guitar will come setup with 9's, but if you prefer to have 10's, just let me know and I will put them on and set it up for that gauge.There is alot of scratches throughout and there is one really nice ding on the contour side of the body (pic 7), but overall this guitar is in pretty good shape. I tried my best to document all areas of the guitar, so please view the pics closely. The truss rod cover and backplate for the trem claw are missing.As far as upgrades, a trem setter type (not sure of the make or manufacture but it works really well) has been installed giving you the option preventing the bridge from pulling back or going out of tune when braking a string. I currently have the bridge floating, but you can set it however you would like. The stock pickups have been swapped out for some budget guitar madness 1984 pickups which aren't bad for early metal and hard rock tones. To top it off, I have installed a push pull pot in the tone pot position to coil cut each pickup (last 2 pics). So single coilish tones are within reach.This guitar weighs 7lbs and 3oz.This listing is only for the guitar. No case or gig bag, but I will pack it up very well. I will ship it with a full set of allen wrenches, and possibly the whammy bar if I can locate it.This will ship with full insurance and a required signature.
