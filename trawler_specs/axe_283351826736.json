{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "** WORKING PERFECTLY GOOD - WITH SOME VISIBLE COSMETIC DAMAGES (please see all the pictures) - There is a broken small area that has been covered with colorful tape by the last owner ** * You'll receive the guitar - cable and amplifier * THIS IS A LIMITED EDITION DESIGN Retail Original Price is over $300 AppearanceWell it looks like a butterfly, so obviously not any type of standard shape. It\u2019s is very colorful and looks nice, the headstock is kind of different because it is shaped like a tear. The butterfly is short scale, so it is around 22 1/2\u2033, which you can consider to be a short-scale along the lines of the Mini Strat or Ibanez Mikro. This instrument is a decent starter guitar for a girl who wants something that looks good and that plays okay. Some players may find the shape to be a bit awkward to play at first. If you like the look of the Butterfly you will probably also want to check out Daisy Rock\u2019s other short scale guitars: The Ladybug, The Star, The Daisy, The Heartbreaker, The Comet are some of DR\u2019s other uniquely shaped short scale models. PlayabilityThe Butterfly is pretty light weight at only 5lbs, so that is a big plus for smaller kids who will have trouble playing a heavy instrument. The neck is very thin, so if you have a child with small hands they will find the smaller neck easier to play. The butterfly shape is a little awkward some kids might find if uncomfortable to hold and play because of the shape. The action on the strings is good and easy for kids to press down. SoundThe sound is decent for the price. It is easy to tune although it does go out of tune a little quicker than I would expect although that might just be because the Butterfly is short-scale so it is hard to avoid. The amp isn\u2019t the greatest and that affects the sound quality, so you may want to switch the amp out for something better. ElectronicsThe Butterfly has a single humbucker pickup which some might argue limits the range of tone, although this generally isn\u2019t a big issue for a beginner.", "ItemID": "283351826736", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T23:40:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T23:40:21.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Daisy-Rock-Debutante-Butterfly-Short-Scale-Fantasy-Electric-Guitar-/283351826736", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Woodbridge, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833518267368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/qPUAAOSwd7xcSkrD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/qdcAAOSw0YlcSkrG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/8FQAAOSwxJ9cSkrJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/YEEAAOSwdwVcSkrK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/VZQAAOSwW~JcSkrN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/HPEAAOSw7D1cSkrP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/PJYAAOSwpptcSkrR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/8fQAAOSwlx9cSkrT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/ocsAAOSwSVNcSkrW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIwWDEwNzk=/z/qRMAAOSwd7xcSkrX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "22191", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "marvydeal.llc", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 13, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 90.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 129.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 129.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P19DT4H30M34S", "Title": "Daisy Rock Debutante Butterfly Short Scale Fantasy Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Short Scale"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Daisy Rock"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 126, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1603410173", "StoreName": "Marvy Deal"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "With some visible cosmetic damages - working perfectly good", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
