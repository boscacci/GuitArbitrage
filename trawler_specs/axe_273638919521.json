{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is this Trans Green Jackson Performer PS-7 Guitar. These guitars were made in Japan and are a quality build. These guitars originally came from the Factory with the Wilkinson Tremolo and a Single ply black pick guard with a HSS Pickup configuration. This one has been upgraded at some point with a custom cut white perloid pick guard and Tremolo cover plate and a HH Pickup configuration with a three way switch. These pickups sound great and are pretty hot. I\u2019m not sure what pickups are in this guitar but they sound amazing. The neck on these guitars have a nice thin profile and a nice flat radius for some serious shredding with ease. There is no original trem arm but I can throw a generic Tremolo arm in but it\u2019s not the one that came with this guitar or Tremolo. This guitar is missing the high E string but really could use a complete set of new strings as these strings are old. This Guitar is used and does show signs of use but is still a solid guitar. The body and finish do have some chips, dings, and scratches (see pics). However these are only cosmetic and do not affect the function of this guitar. Some would say it has character or Mojo. Matter of opinion I guess. This one is a player for sure. This guitar will need a new set of strings and a set up to your liking. This guitar will come with a used gig bag. No hard sell case just a used gig bag. This guitar is in excellent shape for being almost 20 years old. Please review all pics as they are part of the description. Please ask any and all questions before purchasing as I do not accept returns. I only ship to the lower 48 states of the USA. That means that I do not ship to Alaska or Hawaii.

This item will be packaged safe and secure and insured so that it arrives to you in the exact condition it leaves here. Please review my feedback and buy with confidence. This guitar is in fully functioning condition as are all the items I sell.", "ItemID": "273638919521", "EndTime": "2019-03-05T04:35:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T04:35:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-Performer-PS-7-Guitar-Trans-Green-MIJ-Wilkinson-Tremolo-Gig-Bag-/273638919521", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fredericksburg, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736389195218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~s4AAOSwaiBcLtju/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JqkAAOSwvdFcLtjf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YFIAAOSwltxcLtjx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oyQAAOSwVNNcLtjs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jwEAAOSwgcdcLtjq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YQYAAOSw~sJcLtjo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JtMAAOSwusdcLtjk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-b0AAOSwrpJcLtjv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vgcAAOSwEJ1cLtjz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/k0YAAOSwQZVcLtji/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lBYAAOSwEKxcLtjh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G34AAOSwPmVcLtjm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "22405", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rodney6024", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1035, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 280.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 280.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P28DT7H28M4S", "Title": "Jackson Performer PS-7 Guitar Trans Green MIJ With Wilkinson Tremolo & Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Performer PS-7"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Trans Green"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Wilkenson Tremolo"]}]}, "HitCount": 133, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=299144936", "StoreName": "Happenstance Store"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
