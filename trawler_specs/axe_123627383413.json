{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Awesome Kramer Super Strat from the 80s! No Reserve! This is my first Kramer, I bought it in a large bulk collection not long ago. I'm no Kramer aficionado, but I do know that Kramers were the quintessential guitar of the 80s thanks to guys like Eddie Van Halen. This is an awesome playing and beefy sounding guitar, weighs every bit of 9-10lbs. Has a bound maple top, probably alder body, rose fretboard. Frets show some wear, but there is a lot of life left in them. There are some scuffs, and some minor dings, but overall I would say it's in great condition for an 80s model. Floyd Rose II with arm, early Duncan designed pickups, the selector switch is for the humbucker. The middle tone knob only controls the middle pickup. It has a 5 way switch, so you can get that Strat sound in the 2 and 4 position. It could use a new set of strings, I broke the 1st string last night while testing the dive bomb capabilities. This is a very collectible guitar, that will only go up in value as years go by! Feel free to ask questions, comes with padded Levys gig bag! Note: My camera phone sucks, it's much nicer in person. There are reflections due to being outside.", "ItemID": "123627383413", "EndTime": "2019-02-11T02:00:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-04T02:00:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1980s-Kramer-Super-Strat-Floyd-Rose-Seymour-Duncans-electric-guitar-/123627383413", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Centre, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236273834138080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VrsAAOSwKphcVylz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OxYAAOSw3ltcVx1b/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/00cAAOSwmrNcVx1i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Tu8AAOSwF7lcVx1s/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IOUAAOSwIkNcVymG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/n5wAAOSwWapcVx19/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FxYAAOSw6jpcVx2I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OVgxNjAw/z/CIMAAOSwmMNcVyma/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Fy4AAOSwVAtcVx2Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qfEAAOSwsDZcVx2i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sOQAAOSwjYVcVx2t/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WQgAAOSw0~pcVx20/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "35960", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mmorgan57", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 627, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.8, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 18, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 60.56, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 60.56, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1372}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P6DT4H53M10S", "Title": "Vintage 1980s Kramer Super Strat Floyd Rose Seymour Duncans electric guitar ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["kramer"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}]}, "HitCount": 244, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 61.56, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
