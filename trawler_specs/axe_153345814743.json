{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage 1970's AIMS Lawsuit SG Electric Guitar Beside the weird fading and decal lifting on the headstock, it is in Very Good condition. Some dings and scratches but this guitar looks hardly played. Frets are a little sharp along the edges. It plays like butter IMO. Guitar overall has a great feel and great sound. Please look at pictures. *Due to the vintage nature of this instrument it is sold as is and there are no returns.`ATTENTION: I HAVE EXPLAINED THIS ITEM TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INTEREST & VIEWING MY LISTING :) When leaving feedback please contact me before leaving anything less then a 5 and allow me to rectify whatever your concern is. 3 or 4 out of 5 may sound pretty good but EBAY takes action against sellers that average less then 4.7. Fours hurt :( We ship within 3 BUSINESS DAYS so that means if you buy on a Thursday it might not get out till Tuesday. We usually get it out quicker so please DO NOT be impatient and barrage us with emails. Bid with confidence.
