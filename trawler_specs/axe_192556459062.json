{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello ! Up for sale is a super duper player of a 6 string electric guitar by Squier (by Fender).....the Stagemaster ! Squier gets a bad rep sometimes, but they have been putting out some terrific quality guitars lately. THIS model hearkens back to a time that reminds us that Squier made some really nice axes back in the day as well ! Squier's Standard Series that this model comes from is one of those lines! The first thing that really stuck out about this guitar when I first played it was its action and playability ! It was so nice and low so you could do everything including shred fast on this guitar. But yet, it didn't fret out or buzz due to the action being so low. And you didn't lose any tonality from it.....it's a great SOUNDING guitar on top of being an amazing player ! Speaking of that, I've also set the intonation on this axe, which seems to have improved its tuning stability even more. I've also filed the fret ends down for some smooth hand movement up and down the really fast neck ! I also thought I'd try to make this guitar a poor man's Eric Johnson Strat, so I had an Eric Johnson pickup installed in the neck. It did give the guitar a little more clarity going through and amp.....basically just made a good guitar better. Other cool features include the reverse headstock for cool retro looks (and some people say it also adds to the sound because it lengthens the lower strings), and of course, the licensed Floyd Rose tremolo for all types of sonic mayhem ! One of the tuners broke, so it was actually upgraded to a Wilkinson tuning key...very nice! It really pains me to let go of this beaut of a guitar, as it has been in my personal collection for many many years now. But I got another Stagemaster that I was originally planning to sell, but THIS unit is better, in my opinion.....and I want my customers to be really happy with what they buy from us. So here it is for sale! Grab it now before someone else does! Please read the condition description, this item description, and examine the pictures carefully. Thanks so much for your interest and I hope you buy it now!!!!!", "ItemID": "192556459062", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T21:35:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-06-01T21:35:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dark-Blue-Squier-by-Fender-Stagemaster-Floyd-Rose-Eric-Johnson-neck-p-u-/192556459062", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Mill, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1925564590628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2MzY=/z/~~gAAOSw8StbEbnH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2Mjc=/z/7NYAAOSwX7JbEbn0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI1NVg4ODY=/z/FhUAAOSwCHBbEboj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2Njc=/z/XXQAAOSwYK1bEbpX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2NzE=/z/XlQAAOSwyDFbEbqn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIyNFg4ODY=/z/VqUAAOSwDPNbEbra/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzg5WDE1ODc=/z/UyMAAOSwhIZbEbsP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzg5WDE1ODc=/z/7M8AAOSw24RbEbs2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzYzWDE1ODc=/z/JboAAOSwZ~hbEbtq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM5Nlg4ODY=/z/YfMAAOSwUwlbEbuT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjA3WDE1Mzk=/z/eVQAAOSw48dbEbvl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Wh0AAOSwrmRb~GsM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29707", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "heavyspender", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3196, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 259.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 259.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "Asia", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P22DT1H3M38S", "Title": "Dark Blue Squier (by Fender) Stagemaster with Floyd Rose.
