{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1960s Teisco Guitar Tulip Model E-110 1 PU Clean Rare Sunburst The guitar plays well and looks amazing. Rare model. Forget those relic guitars go for the real thing! It\u2019s been played normally and gigged. All relatively light wear. The frets are in excellent condition and everything works. Overall this guitar is in great shape. The guitar has minor superficial dings, scratches, wear and tear around various parts of the guitar. Typical of a guitar of this age. As with any guitar that\u2019s been sitting in storage it going to need new strings and set up. Please consider this when bidding on my items. Its vintage folks and anything this old could need a minor tune up. Shipping, Payment & Important Details Your item will be shipped immediately after I receive payment.
