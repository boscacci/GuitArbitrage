{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "BuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 259.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "Description": "You are bidding on a Cort Larry Coryell LCS-2 Jazz Box Hollowbody guitar that is in good shape. There are a few dings here and there, a chipped tone knob, and some chipping away of the finish on the side of the neck at the first fret area. I have also taken a photo of some finish cracking at the base of the neck. None of this affects the playability of the guitar at all, it actually plays very nice, has low action, and plays smooth and fast. This is a beautiful guitar that I have priced to sell, I just don't ever play this guitar. This is an unusual version of the LCS-2, it has many features that were only found on the more expensive LCS-1. Most LCS-2's did not have inlays in the neck, a wood pick guard that was color matched to the body, and gold plated hardware. I am assuming that this was a very late production model, and perhaps they were using up the items from the LCS-1 parts bin? Just a guess on my part, I have not seen another one like this. Any marks on the guitar that look like scratches are just reflections from the overhead lights. It has the Duncan Designed pick ups, a floating bridge, beautiful neck inlays, 2 volume, and 2 tone controls, and a 3-way selector switch. I do not have a case for the guitar, but it will be packaged very securely. I will ship within the U.S. only. Thanks, and happy bidding.", "ItemID": "223354423823", "BuyItNowAvailable": true, "ConvertedBuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 259.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "EndTime": "2019-02-06T22:32:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T22:32:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Cort-LCS-2-Larry-Coryell-Jazz-Hollowbody-nice-shape-great-player-unusual-LCS2-/223354423823", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Oregon, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233544238238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DzUAAOSwPFtcUiNc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/d60AAOSw3P5cUiNg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/TmgAAOSwaSVcUiNh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ijIAAOSwmo1cUiNk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/xHQAAOSwl1RcUiNm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/x5EAAOSwBAZcUiNo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/91cAAOSw9xJcUiNq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/0UsAAOSwU0hcUiNs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/pVIAAOSwDmxcUiNu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/qMMAAOSwylBcUiNw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/OCsAAOSwJ1lcUiNz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ozYAAOSw6hNcUiN0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53575", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jazztrax", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 712, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT20H18M55S", "Title": "Cort LCS-2 Larry Coryell Jazz Hollowbody, nice shape, great player, unusual LCS2", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Cort"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Jazz"]}]}, "HitCount": 81, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
