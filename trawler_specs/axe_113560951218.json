{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "YAMAHA RGX 211M Electric Guitar Lady Bug Kellie Ann Graphic A rare Yamaha RGX 211M Graphic Electric Guitar!!! I don't know the history of this one but it has an unusual graphic finish, it's in memory of Kellie Ann and it looks like it's inlay not paint to me, not sure if this was a custom order axe or done after factory, really cool though! It has a 24 fret maple neck with maple fretboard, black hardware, and a quality made Floyd Rose type single locking tremolo with the whammy bar. It has 2 pickups that sound great! (single coil and what appears to be an old Seymore Duncan Zebra humbucker)it even has a cool red push button Kill Switch! It is 24.75 scale and the neck width at the nut is 1 11/16\". The condition is almost excellent(an 8.9 out of 10) with light signs of use and shows light fret wear, the guitar is really very nice all around with no problems except the back of the neck has a wear spot and the body has a few dings and scratches(see pics), the headstock is worn but I can see the model RGX 211M still. Includes the padded Fender gig bag case. USA Shipping, handling, and insurance charge will be $50 in USPS's deliverable USA 48 states.
