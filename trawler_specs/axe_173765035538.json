{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "SPECTRUM Solid Body Les Paul Style Ebony Black Electric Guitar with 2 Humbucker pickups. NO RESERVE GOOD LUCK BIDDING! There is no warranty on any item I sell. I usually ship within 3 business days after payment is cleared and received. This does not include weekends or holidays. Depending on the shipping mode, actual receipt of item will take longer. Please by aware of the time each shipper allows. For example, when shipping by USPS Media Mail, for books, the Post Office allows 2-10 days. For estimated shipping times (in transit), please check the website of that shipper being used to ship your item and use the tracking number that I will provide you. For ground shipments (anything over 3 pounds), I will use USPS Standard Post. I do not use UPS or Fed Ex Ground because the eBay shipping calculator is not accurate for large or heavy shipments West of the Mississippi. I ship from Virginia. DOMESTIC (US) SHIPPING: I use tracking and/or delivery confirmation for every Domestic (US) shipment. For USPS, I send all Domestic (US) shipping with Delivery Confirmation. Tracking will be provided. Any requested expedited shipping (one day) will cost additional. INTERNATIONAL (non US) SHIPPING: I use USPS Priority International or USPS First Class shipping (small light items) only for all international shipments. I will mark all items as merchandise and will not lower any customs value. Please do not request custom value reductions. Keep in mind, USPS First Class is not insurable and cannot be tracked. It is the same as sending a letter.", "ItemID": "173765035538", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T02:45:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T02:45:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/SPECTRUM-Solid-Body-Les-Paul-Ebony-Black-Electric-Guitar-/173765035538", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Charles Town, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737650355388080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTE=/z/6wAAAOSwnuJcThgN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk3/z/U9UAAOSwZKlcThgS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JIoAAOSwIABcThgV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RJcAAOSw-elcThge/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UqUAAOSwl1xcThge/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JykAAOSwJ~xcThgx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA3WDE2MDA=/z/UbYAAOSwpzRcThg3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzMwWDE2MDA=/z/3nUAAOSwKwhcThg9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc5WDE2MDA=/z/540AAOSwBAZcThhE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NzI=/z/NKEAAOSwCXxcThgh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxNDky/z/gi8AAOSwgb1cThgl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU2OVgxNjAw/z/m74AAOSwzFhcThgt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "25414", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "continentalstore", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1758, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 76.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 76.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 23}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT26M38S", "Title": "SPECTRUM Solid Body Les Paul Ebony Black Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Spectrum"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 900, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 77.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Small scratch on top surface (hard to see), One control knob and cover over neck adjustment bolt are missing as shown (easily replaced)", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
