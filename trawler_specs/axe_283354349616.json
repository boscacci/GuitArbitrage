{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Nice! Jay Turser PRS Copy Heritage Cherry. This is a great guitar. Jay Turser, in the style of a PRS type guitar. Two humbuckers, pickup switch, volume and tone knobs. 2-point tremolo (Fender style, I don\u2019t not have the trem arm, but I\u2019m sure it would be easy to find a replacement)... with a very nice set neck, great for sustain. 6 X 6 headstock. Looks like it might be mahogany, but I don\u2019t know for sure, with a very nice \u201cheritage cherry\u201d stain color, similar to a Gibson SG style finish. Neck and frets are in fine condition. Jack is solid, pots are smooth. I upgraded the strap buttons to Schaller strap buttons, compatible with Fender or Schaller strap locks (works great with a regular non locking strap too). The finish is in really good shape, there are no real obvious scratches, maybe a small amount of hardly visible pick wear, but no real significant scratches or dings, it looks pretty nice. The lights in the photos may create some shadows or lines. Given that the guitar has a set neck, I\u2019ve always thought this would make for an awesome upgrade platform. A few small things could take this guitar from great to AWESOME. Happy to share my ideas, message me. I will also throw in a very basic gig bag too. No Returns Sold As-Is, in great working condition. No International buyers Prompt Payment Via PayPal only (NOTE: That I will not be able to ship until after February 17th) My eBay ratings are great... I think the pictures show how nice this guitar is, if you have any questions, please ask.", "ItemID": "283354349616", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T23:13:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T23:13:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Nice-Jay-Turser-PRS-Copy-Electric-Guitar-Heritage-Cherry-Finish-/283354349616", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Ridgewood, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833543496168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nfoAAOSwylBcTOb1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fwYAAOSwjfdcTObz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cCsAAOSw-yJcTOb9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KYEAAOSwhr9cTOb7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MIQAAOSwh7tcTOby/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oAYAAOSwkDtcTOb6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NJ8AAOSw7MNcTObv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/InMAAOSwUMBcTObw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ouMAAOSwt0dcTOb4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~GMAAOSwPA1cTOb3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/v0kAAOSw76lcTOb8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MBAAAOSwvGZcTOb2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07450", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gpjd3rd", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 91, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 245.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 245.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P21DT2H42M11S", "Title": "Nice!
