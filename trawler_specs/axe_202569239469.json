{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "VINTAGE 1965 TEISCO DEL REY electric guitar. Made in JAPAN, MIJ. Model E-100. It is 100% original and complete. It has some wear... scuffs, scratches, bumps, dings. This guitar is in good playing condition. It is in exceptional overall condition, especially when you consider it is over 50 years old. This guitar has a few rare features... SET NECK, non compensated wrap around bridge, early 'fatter' pickup (Ry Cooder ish) and the quintessential TEISCO headstock design. This guitar is shown in images of a 1965 Teisco catalog distributed by WMI Corp., Rosemont Ill. (Teisco Twangers website). Features include: Chrome hardware, open back tuners, bound 20 fret neck, 24.5 inch scale, rosewood fingerboard w/ 'topside' rectangular markers, steel reinforced neck, single coil pickup, volume control, tone control, non-compensating wrap around bridge, single ply pickguard, tobacco sunburst finish. The frets and finger board have been serviced. Neck is straight, if anything it has a very slight back bow. This guitar is crying for some big ol' flat wound strings. There's room in the nut slots and the beefy neck will handle any gauge you string her up with. The pickup is strong, sounds awesome and works great. All the electronics work, no scratchy pots. I have completely serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the body and neck, cleaned the controls, oiled the tuners, cleaned and conditioned the fingerboard, dress/leveled/polished the frets, installed new 10-48 strings, adjusted the bridge, etc. DON'T MISS IT!!
