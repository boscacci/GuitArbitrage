{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "$75 SHIPPING IS FOR THE CONTIGUOUS USA ONLY...SEE MY OTHER AUCTION FOR ANOTHER SUPER COOL RARE POINTY METAL GUITAR. Selling this H-1 Hondo Death Dagger. I'm not sure the year it was made 1987- 2000?? but I consider this the pointiest hair metal guitar probably ever made and it is just too cool. The guitar has a few bumps, cracks, and nicks on it but still overall condition is pretty nice and it plays fine. The upper rear pointy horn took a good bump right on the tip and cracked in that area and some of the paint flaked with it ( see collage photo with 3 angles of this area) ...this is the worst of the damage and has not flaked or moved since it happened years ago. There is a small chip on the edge of the upper horn ( see collage photo with my pinky finger next to it for reference ) and it is about the size of a #2 pencil eraser. There is a very small place on the lower horn next to the input jack that looks to be just in the clearcoat finish ( see collage photo ). I can honestly say that the guitar is in overall good shape and it is RARE to see these come up for sale very often. The case is not in the best looking condition on the exterior but it is well made, sturdy/solid, and all latches work and function fine. Plays Great and Sounds great with the single humbucker /single volume knob setup. Here's your chance to get a collector guitar that doesn't come up for sale very often. Please feel free to ask any questions. I will be happy to answer and send more pictures if requested.
