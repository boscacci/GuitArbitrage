{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautifully aged Agile AL-2500 Les Paul. Black Beauty guitar with Gold Hardware. Agile does not make these anymore and they are getting pretty hard to find. Rare Original Headstock shape and correct horn. Approximately 9 lbs. Plays and sounds great, lots of sustain. When I bought the guitar over 10 years ago the previous owner had repaired some minor neck damage at the scarfe joint. The repair has held fine for over ten years. It wasn't a perfect looking job. The guitar plays great and stays in tune just fine.\u00a0 I have tried my best to capture the neck repair.\u00a0 The 2 tone pots have little bit of sctatchiness, but it never bothered me when I played the guitar. Frets are good and have lots of life left. The guitar comes with a gig bag. Shipping is a flat fee of $75.00. Continental US only, no Hawaii. US auction only. No foreign shipping. Low reserve on this auction due to the neck repair. The hardware alone is worth the reserve price. Heck it has real Grover tuners on it. Good luck and happy bidding.", "ItemID": "323666714406", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T05:09:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T05:09:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Beautifully-aged-Agile-AL-2500-Les-Paul-Black-Beauty-guitar-Gold-Hardware-/323666714406", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Oxnard, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236667144068080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/5owAAOSwfepcS-gZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/KJAAAOSw9D1cS-gb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/b~QAAOSwzExcS-gd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/lFcAAOSwXitcS-gf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/zO0AAOSwrClcS-gg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/hC0AAOSw55FcS-gi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/psEAAOSwdxVcS-gk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/1FYAAOSw9xJcS-gl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "93035", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "igogusto", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 168, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 107}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT2H50M12S", "Title": "Beautifully aged Agile AL-2500 Les Paul.
