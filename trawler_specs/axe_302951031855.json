{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a 80's era Hondo All-Star H-702 electric guitar in very good plus condition. This was Hondo's version of the Fender Bullet. It has 2 humbucking pickups with volume and tone knobs and a 3-way selector and a coil tap. All the electronics are original and in good working condition. There is some minor buckling of the plastic pickguard (typical). Scale length is 25 and a 1/2 in and 1.700 on nut width with a slab board Rosewood fingerboard. The guitar is hard tail with a string through body. The Finish is a dark stain this clear-coated and not easy to photograph but looks very sharp and person the 4th picture gives a good representation of it. The weight on the guitar is 6 lb 9 oz on my scale. For a guitar built in the early mid eighties it is in very good shape. There is minor nicks and scuffs as to be expected of a guitar of this age. The guitar ships with a period case that has one broken latch but will serve for decent protection. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.", "ItemID": "302951031855", "EndTime": "2019-02-07T00:30:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-09T00:30:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/80s-era-Hondo-All-Star-H-702-Bullet-/302951031855", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Newtown, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029510318558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQz/z/pbUAAOSwCi9b5NLp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDgx/z/~TwAAOSwkXFb5NL1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTM=/z/m7UAAOSwsPNb5NL5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMTA5/z/EDoAAOSwfplb5NMC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/mbEAAOSw2bFb5Nbp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NDE=/z/sKEAAOSwb-Rb5Nb2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0OFgxNjAw/z/Y4oAAOSwysFb5NMI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTE3WDE2MDA=/z/7ZUAAOSwhJNb5NML/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "06470", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thetoneshop", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1222, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 259.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 259.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT22H11M13S", "Title": "80's era Hondo All-Star H-702 / Bullet ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Hondo"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 153, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=36734289", "StoreName": "thetoneshop"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
