{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a one-of-a-kind guitar that was professionally assembled by Don\u2019t Panic Guitar Works out of Lewiston, Pennsylvania. It is a custom build that has every bit of the twang you would expect from a classic Fender Telecaster. It\u2019s used but still in mint condition. -Chrome hardware including a custom six saddle string thru bridge -Mighty Mite Solid Maple Neck with skunk stripe finished in a vintage tint nitro gloss -Premium Kluson Locking Tuners - Keep great tune - very cool vintage style buttons -White Graph Tech Tusq String Trees -Custom 3 ply white armrest guard -Fatboy Telecaster Neck Pickup -Surf 90 Bridge Pickup These pickups are boutique and sound amazing. The Bridge is very similar to the tone of a traditional Tele bridge with a bit more power, growl, and sparkle, like a gretsch, a dearmond, and p90 had a baby! Awesome! The Neck Fatboy is fat and beefy but very clear and articulate, similar to my ears to a Fat 50s strat pup and great for blues. The middle position is a great blend of the two. It sounds amazing. This guitar would be great for country, blues, classic rock, punk, and alt rock.\u00a0 Setup with medium-low action to my preference. A pro setup may be required as with any new-to-YOU guitar. The guitar will ship in basic padded gig bag with substantial packaging to ensure safe arrival.", "ItemID": "223330151538", "EndTime": "2019-02-16T18:01:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-17T18:01:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-Built-Telecaster-Gun-Metal-Blue-Incredible-TWANG-/223330151538", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Allen, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233301515388080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTU0/z/rwEAAOSwr3xbts18/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UZcAAOSwYM9bky67/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-h8AAOSwRPhbky7D/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wrYAAOSwISNbky7Q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-gAAAOSwRPhbky6y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j0wAAOSwwFJbky6i/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UZUAAOSwYM9bky61/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NDI=/z/6JQAAOSw8Ftbky6k/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dFsAAOSwtgJbky6u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fOYAAOSwmVdbky7J/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SiEAAOSwbF1bky6n/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X2gAAOSwJFhbky7U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "75002", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "john198809", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 535, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P11DT20H54M42S", "Title": "Custom Built Telecaster - Gun Metal Blue with Incredible TWANG", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 83, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
