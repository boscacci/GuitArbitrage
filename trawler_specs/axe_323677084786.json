{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1986 Made in Japan Fender Bullet 1 E Series Contemporary Telecaster with new Neck and Rosewood Fingerboard Made by Fender Japan in 1986, it's an E series Squier Bullet 1 Contemporary Telecaster. (Fender made both Tele and Strat versions.)Original Alpine White paint (color appears just like Olympic White on US models) has very few scratches or dings. All original electronics with the original System 1 non-locking tremolo. SSH configuration with original pickups. Single coil neck position, single coil middle and a humbucker in the bridge position - all with a hotter sound than any normal telecaster. After all, the contemporary series was Fender's version of a heavy metal guitar in the '80's. Therefore: hotter pickups, deeper cutaway, modern shape, and a tremolo! Nothing has been changed or modified about the electronics, they're all original. This is technically a \"Frankenscaster\" because it is a Vintage '86 Japanese Contemporary Telecaster with a replacement Fender-Licensed rosewood fingerboard neck. The neck was broken and I was left with a great guitar body and all the original electronics - but needing a neck. The replacement neck I chose is a fully Fender Licensed WD telecaster replacement with a Rosewood fingerboard with medium jumbo frets and a 9.25 fingerboard radius. Neck has aged gloss lacquer and the Fender Telecaster logo. I believe all of these guitars originally came with maple fingerboards. (I've never seen another one with rosewood), I prefer rosewood, so I went with rosewood for the replacement. The high quality replacement neck probably cost me as much as the whole guitar cost new in the 1980's. Neck installation and set-up done by a professional luthier's guitar shop here in South Austin,TX - ( I did not do the work myself), I did not ask his permission to use his name in my eBay sale, so I haven't used it here. Everything is in perfect working order and guitar has nice low action. Set up with 10-48 strings. Please feel free to ask me any questions. Buyer gets exact guitar in photos.
