{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "WINDSONG Electric Guitar Semi Hollow Body H&H Pickups Floyd Rose Tremlo Here is another project I will never get around to....I bought this guitar a couple years ago for it's body and to convert it into a synth guitar. I always wanted a semi-hollow body with a Humbuckers and a Floyd Rose. It is in good condition but needs some work. The body is clean, solid, heavy and pretty much blemish free. Speckled gold top finish....may be a composite.The hardware is good, pickups and switch work, knobs work, no noise. Tuners are a little sloppy, Floyd Rose is pretty tight. The neck needs and adjustment, (reminds me of a Fender Mustang), it has a couple small nicks in the fret board. No case, No Tremlo arm. This could be made into something really cool, let your imagination run wild....US and Canada only on this one.
