Adjustments, repairs, tuning, maintenance are ALL up to YOU, the buyer. Please do not complain back to me when you have to do them. None of these are \"item not as described\", \" defective\" or \" I didnt think it would be like that\", or \"item not working correctly\"...if complaining to ebay or to me. This item is used, sold as-is.....as shown in the pics, which are part of the description. YOU set the value, so there are no returns, refunds, or price adjustments Shipping continental USA street address, signature required. NO international shipping, no PO FPO boxes, no \"pick-ups\". NO 3rd party shipping foolishness. NO buyer supplied labels...even if you have your own shipper. I will pack, label, and ship it. USPS or FED EX. Ships ONLY to the person and street address on the ebay ship info page. NO other person or place, for ANY reason. I will NOT change any ship info, make sure this info is correct...BEFORE bidding. No changes to any part of the ship address after you bid, and win. You will be VERY disappointed when I wont change it. The paypal payer , and the ship address must be the same. It's checked before shipping.....if something isnt kosher you will be informed, and it will delay shipping until its rectified. This is a typical ebay scam, having differing info, and also the seller loses \"seller protection\", whatever that is... if info is changed. If you want something shipped to someone else/another place.......I will ship it to you.......you get the item......and.YOU ship it to another person...This is how it is............ think twice about bidding if this bothers you. You will have to directly sign for this item, you may have to go to the ship office to pick it up. USPS or FED EX.................again think twice if this bothers you. The shipper is the ones ebay uses.......usps or fed ex.....no other shipper......NOT ups...NOT dhl...NOT pony express........even if thats \"the one Ive used\"...\" i have my own shipper\", or\"other sellers have done it before\" Paypal only, payment within 24 hr of auction end", "ItemID": "113608569348", "EndTime": "2019-02-07T18:52:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T18:52:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FRENANDES-ZO3-electric-guitar-NICE-/113608569348", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "USA", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136085693488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PnoAAOSw~flcU0Ji/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/maIAAOSwXgxcU0Js/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NMAAAOSw5tNcU0J1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kkcAAOSwBPRcU0KC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iDgAAOSw6jJcU0KL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FXIAAOSwJH5cU0KT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lBoAAOSwZwBcU0Kb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dhwAAOSwGIZcU0Ki/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Mk0AAOSwL05cU0Kr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qQ4AAOSwIdVcU0Kz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bigcleanout", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 948, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 60.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 60.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2102}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P3DT4M29S", "Title": "FRENANDES ZO3 electric guitar NICE", "HitCount": 85, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 61.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "NICE , working great", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
