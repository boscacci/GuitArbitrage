{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Made in Japan early 80's Hondo H75. The 21 fret maple/rosewood neck neck has zero fret wear, and dot inlays,medium frets . Headstock has a small nick to the finish at the tip.The High Gloss Red Body looks nice but shows some wear.Has a couple small chips and a crack at the end of the neck heel. One previous owner decided to put steel plate looking film on the pickguard and rear tremolo cover. They did a good job but it must have been done years ago because it shows wear and small areas where it has worn off [please see the pictures]. Guitar looks like a pretty well taken care of nearly 40 year old guitar.The guitar appears to be all original except for the whammy bar. These supposedly came stock with early Di Marzio pickup.It sounds awesome through my half stack. Guitar looks,plays, and sounds great .Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
