{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale I have for you a way cool 1997 Epiphone T-310. This is a vintage, fairly rare and collectible piece made in Korea in a classic color. This guitar is close to immaculate condition with the exception of a long finish crack on the front. The crack is in the finish only. I thought about feathering in a matching color of nail polish but decided to leave it alone. This instrument presents beautifully the way it is. Much of the original plastic wrap and stickers were still on but I like to see the full beauty of a guitar. There is just the slightest bit of scratching on the pickguard and a tiny amount of corrosion in the control plate from lack of use. I don\u2019t think this one was ever set up. I have cleaned and polished, tightened, oiled the fretboard, adjusted the truss rod, adjusted the intonation, fresh set of Ernie Ball Super Slinkys. No wear on the frets, a little more discoloration from lack of use on the frets can be polished off. The guitar is playing and sounding better every day. Since it probably was idle and uncared for for a long time I\u2019m expecting a little more tweaking in the near future will put this awesome piece in orbit. Electronics work as they should, pickups sound great but could probably be adjusted for height and balance a little better. Action is low and fast and harmonics are ringing. You can turn the reverb up and get your country cleans and pedal steel type sounds, but I had fun turning up the distortion on my little Blackstar and was nailing the Richie Blackmore sound from Smoke on the Water. Who knew with that tiny little lipstick pickup! Pretty cool to have a telecaster with a Gibson logo on it. Lots of mojo..... Look over my pictures carefully and ask questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed. Check our eBay rating and feedback. I sell the guitar stuff. I ship promptly, carefully and insured...... thanks for looking....", "ItemID": "173771671689", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T21:10:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T21:10:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EPIPHONE-T-310-VINTAGE-BATWING-TELECASTER-MIK-/173771671689", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bettendorf, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737716716898080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/k94AAOSwGIZcU1Yc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pk8AAOSwqkRcU1Ya/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5TkAAOSwxqpcU1Yi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NMQAAOSwZ-9cU1Yn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uMwAAOSwEp5cU1Ys/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/caoAAOSw0xtcU1Yy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uikAAOSwPXFcU1Y3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lB4AAOSwGIZcU1Y~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RuEAAOSw411cU1ZE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DVUAAOSwmFxcU1ZL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FcwAAOSwPNhcU1ZO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rFAAAOSwl7dcU1ZX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mychildren5-2008", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2015, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT18H56M22S", "Title": "EPIPHONE T-310 VINTAGE  \u201cBATWING TELECASTER\u201d MIK", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["T-310"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Vintage Ivory"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 110, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=847815792", "StoreName": "Bargain Charlie&#39;s"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent...basically unused", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
