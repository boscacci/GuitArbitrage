{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "We are a guitar shop and this is was traded in. 2007 ESP LTD EC-500 Singlecut Made in Korea. Set neck, mahogany neck and body, EMG 81 & 85 active pickups. Smoked black hardware, Dunlop Strap buttons, flag fingerboard inlays, carved top, and great sustain. Plays low and clean, neck is perfectly straight, electronics work perfectly, new Switchcraft jack professionally installed. Tone is thick and sustain from the EMG pickups is unmatched. Pinch harmonics are a breeze, this is a rock guitar. Body has some wear, a few small chips in the back bottom edge, a couple of small chips in the tip of the cutaway, some scratches and belt buckle rash. Also missing the screw on battery door because who put a screw on battery door into the design? Battery has an intenal clip to hold the battery firmly in place regardless of a door being on. No real fret wear, but some cosmetic wear. A solid 7.5 out of 10. No need to worry about the first ding you put in it, but priced accordingly. Made in Korea is nice, the quality is amazing throughout. Includes basic used gig bag not pictured.", "ItemID": "123624575013", "EndTime": "2019-02-04T23:13:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T23:13:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-EC-500-Singlecut-Set-Neck-White-W-EMG-Pickups-Grover-Tuners-MIK-/123624575013", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Wausau, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236245750138080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eqwAAOSwqqJby4BN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/49kAAOSwhX5by4BZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1d4AAOSwredby4Bj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wBAAAOSw3zFby4Bt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wCAAAOSw3zFby4B2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "54401", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "octoberguitars1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1452, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 279.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 279.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT2H44M2S", "Title": "ESP LTD EC-500 Singlecut Set Neck White W/EMG Pickups Grover Tuners MIK", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["EC-500"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP LTD"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 93, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=33191330", "StoreName": "acousticcreation"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great sustain with this beauty.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
