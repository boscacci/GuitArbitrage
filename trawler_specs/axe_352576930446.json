{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states only,FedEx, no post office boxes because FedEx will not deliver to a post office box.I will not ship anywhere else. If you are viewing this ad from a mobil device make sure you take the time to read the full description and view the extra 20 pictures that are in the full ad. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone by Gibson Les Paul Special Custom Shop Limited Edition Slash AFD with some nice modifications.These guitars feature a tuner built right into the bridge pickup ring,they work well and are a really nice feature,however when this guitar arrived I noticed the little button that turns the tuner on and off was missing. The tuner still works fine but you have to push something small in the hole like a toothpick or small allen wrench to turn the tuner on and off. The guitar also has a ding on the back edge ,there is some finish missing, otherwise the guitar is in very good condition, just mild surface scratches. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. I also changed the pickups to some nice nickel covered humbuckers to get the look I wanted. I then upgraded the stock tone capacitor with a nice .015uf Japanese mylar film cap. Sounded very full on clean tones and had a well defined snarl once I added some gain. Guitar looks except for the ding,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
