{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a very unique 80\u2019s Explorer electric bass guitar. Most likely Japanese. It was converted to be fretless. It\u2019s a great job. Small pieces of maple were inlayed into the fret slots. The neck is ultra smooth and plays great. Nylon wrapped flatwound strings are installed. Solid mahogany neck with solid ash body wings. The headstock had some repair work done and mahogany veneer was placed on the front and back. It\u2019s totally solid now and gives it a cool look. The neck is straight and truss rod functions as it should. All electronics are checked and sound great. The original case is included but really beat up. Missing a latch and the exterior is ugly. The bass fits well and it will provide some shipping protection. I will ship well packaged in a proper box.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "202563823570", "EndTime": "2019-02-11T05:08:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T05:08:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/80-s-Japan-Explorer-Fretless-Electric-Bass-Guitar-Trans-Black-Neck-Thru-w-Case-/202563823570", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025638235708080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8DoAAOSwMkdcOXP6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hlQAAOSwXIdcOXQA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4h8AAOSwnCdcOXPu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GC0AAOSwkjJcOXP0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/280AAOSwgfRcOXPx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/drsAAOSwPYRcOXPz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/06QAAOSw09NcOXP2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dWUAAOSwhu9cOXP3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YM0AAOSwvNVcOXP8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EboAAOSwmPlcOXP9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/URcAAOSwa55cOXP5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/acUAAOSwSVNcOXP-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6659, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P6DT8H36M59S", "Title": "80\u2019s Japan Explorer Fretless Electric Bass Guitar Trans Black Neck Thru w/ Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Fretless"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 603, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
