{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I bought this guitar a few years ago new from a custom manufacturer. I named her Nina. I am its only owner. It was my backup guitar throughout high school and early on in college. I played only one gig with it, but practiced with it quite a bit. As a result, there are a few minor scratches on the body. Nothing that took off the finish. There is a spot behind the bridge where there is some residue from tape - I scratched as much of it off as I could (I had a picture of Nina Agdal taped to the body). Overall it is a great condition. It is set up and intonated with 10-46 gauge strings. I often used 11-50s, which worked fine too. I currently have it strung with 9-42s. No issues. I have the action as low as possible without there being too much fret buzz. Everything is stock except the tune-o-matic bridge which I replaced. It comes with a fake leather Fender strap and has been fitted with two gold tone strap locks to match the gold colored hardware. It is a bit hard for me to part ways with it, but I haven't really played guitar seriously since early college, this guys been collecting dust in my room for years now. I'll be going off to grad school next semester, might be moving after that, don't play too much anymore, and I could really use the money.", "ItemID": "123619867250", "EndTime": "2019-02-06T03:54:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T03:54:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Chinese-LP-Chibson-Left-Handed-/123619867250", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Northford, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236198672508080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dbYAAOSwMkdcUR56/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sHQAAOSw-QBcUR58/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rmIAAOSwjfBcUR5-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1toAAOSwgdtcUR6A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H4wAAOSwSidcUR6D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2D0AAOSw6eRcUR6E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M1kAAOSwmo1cUR6G/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06472", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "75cinreds", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 54, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2778}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT8H45M54S", "Title": "Chinese LP Chibson Left Handed", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 148, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
