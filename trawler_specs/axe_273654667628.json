{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "up for sale is a left Handed Fender Stratocaster Body in white from 2006. this body is in decent shape with some dings and a few cracks in the paint job. most of the dings are along the sides of the body, I've tried to take photos of them, but it was a little difficult with the bright white color. Photo 11 is just left of the bottom strap peg. this is one of the areas where there seems to be a slight crack in the paint, its not to bad and doesn't seem like its spreading or anything, but there. in photo 9, there is an area where there 2 clean lines cut into it shaped like this >. I'm not sure why its there, but it is there none the less. this body is in decent shape with a number of cosmetic flaws that do not effect play ability, might even be a good base for a nice relic job. overall, I would give the cosmetic condition about a 5.5, maybe 6 out of 10. if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
