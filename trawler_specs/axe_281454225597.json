{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a nice Yamaha Pacifica 112, built in Taiwan It's all original. Missing the plastic end knob on the five-way switch. Has the HSS configuration. This guitar has a couple small nicks on the back of the horn. The guitar is really in great shape. It has very few scratches or imperfections. The neck is very straight. The action is nice, electronics are fine. No fretwear. This guitar had very low milage on it. These are very solid built guitars and represent a great value in the guitar industry. These are good enough to gig with and the pickups will surprise you. No gigbag or whammy. Thx Yamaha Pacifica is the name of a series of electric guitars manufactured by Yamaha. The line was designed in Yamaha's California custom-shop by Rich Lasner, working with guitar builder Leo Knapp. Initially intended by Lasner and Knap as a test project, Yamaha Japan chose to produce the instruments. Many variants were produced throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, including Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster-like models, twelve string models, carved-top, set-neck versions, and superstrat type models. The maple neck has a very thin satin finish \u2013 it almost feels like it\u2019s been oiled \u2013 and is tidily mounted to the body with the standard four screws and neck plate. The neck is well shaped, a full-ish \u2018C\u2019 that feels thinner in depth than it actually is. Fretting is excellent from a medium size wire (approx 2.37mm wide x 1.36 high); the ends of the slots are filled, the side edge of the fingerboard is slightly curved, just like an old Fender, not straight like so many low-end guitars. There\u2019s even a little rounding to the top edge of the fingerboard. Here comes my standard disclosure statement: For all my foreign friends, you need to know how the process works, all the extra customs fees and taxes are your burden. Shipping will be anywhere from $65 to $120. Because each player has his own desires of how an instrument should feel, I will always try to explain the essence of the particular guitar, knowing that most players will have them set-up to their liking by their techs later. But you'll never get a dud with gstars, that's my promise to you! Why? Cause gstars knows guitars! Please remember that I do have a return policy. \"Over 1000 Instruments shipped Worldwide\" Posted with eBay Mobile", "ItemID": "281454225597", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T23:31:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2014-09-29T23:31:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/YAMAHA-PACIFICA-GUITAR-90s-Taiwan-Model-Gem-/281454225597", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Rising Fawn, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2814542255978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ2WDk5OQ==/z/goEAAOSwVFlUKeu7/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxMDAw/z/t8YAAOSwnDZUKeu9/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ2WDk5OQ==/z/-P4AAOSwQItUKevA/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxMDAw/z/7yMAAOSw-jhUKevE/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxMDAw/z/g0kAAOSwVFlUKevI/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ2WDk5OQ==/z/uK8AAOSwnDZUKevL/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ2WDk5OQ==/z/Jf0AAOSwDk5UKevO/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ2WDk5OQ==/z/44YAAOSwEK9UKevR/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ2WDk5OQ==/z/LgMAAOSwPe1UKevU/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "30738", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "guitar2thestars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 337, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 189.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 189.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT21H12M12S", "Title": "YAMAHA PACIFICA GUITAR - 90s Taiwan Model - Gem", "HitCount": 11198, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Seller"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
