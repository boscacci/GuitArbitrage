{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A used Les Paul style guitar, Made by Gibson Baldwin for their education series. Why buy a new, expensive guitar if you're not sure if this is the thing for you? You can buy a guitar for several hundred dollars, then have it collecting dust in a few months. That's why I bought this model, and found out quickly that I didn't have what it took to be the next Jimi Hendrix. So I'm glad I didn't spend a ton of money on it. Don't get me wrong, it will still scream like its big brothers, but at a fraction of the cost. For you, for your kid, for your Grandma! For whoever! It was bought around 1997, and it has a few scuffs and chips. It's missing both knobs for volume and tone. You can get them at any music store. It comes with a mini amp, powered by a 9-volt battery. Or you can get a 9-volt adapter and plug it into the wall. It also has a 10 foot cord, and a nice guitar stand. I have shipping set at $40, but if you live close to Monmouth County, New Jersey, we can meet up and you can save the shipping! Shipping to the US only, no exceptions!", "ItemID": "283337035457", "EndTime": "2019-02-11T21:32:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T21:32:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Maestro-Gibson-Electric-Guitar-Starter-Pack-Vintage-Sunburst-w-Amp-Les-Paul-/283337035457", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Middletown, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833370354578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/KxsAAOSwPA1cOlyb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/XFAAAOSwpLdcOlym/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/AYgAAOSwtYZcOlyy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/eGUAAOSwa55cOly7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/upkAAOSwmvpcOlzE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07748", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nancyaaaa", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 698, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 75.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 75.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P7DT2H22M31S", "Title": "Maestro by Gibson Electric Guitar Starter Pack Vintage Sunburst w/Amp Les Paul", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson Innovations"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "EAN", "Value": ["0711106621340"]}, {"Name": "ISBN", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["MELPVSCH1"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["711106621340"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 853, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
