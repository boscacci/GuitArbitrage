{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I'm selling a MADE I JAPAN 1983 IBANEZ ROADSTAR 2 RS335 ELECTRIC GUITAR. ALL ORIGINAL. it is in used but good condition. typical play wear for it's age. pictures show a chip around output jack. all controls function properly. knobs are a bit stiff but not scratchy, no crackling or noise. includes original tremolo bar. at one time, i had put another humbucker in and used a 2 to 3 screw adaptor. i am including this with the guitar(but not an extra humbucker).see picture. it is strung with 52-10 gauge set and is currently setup a half step down. however the guitar easily adjusts to however you like. truss rod works great and the tremolo height adjustment is a breeze to work with. built like a tank. ibanez guitars changed after this year. but the guitars of this era are made extremely well! there is no case. will be carefully packed to your taste: guitar with strings at regular tension,guitar with strings detuned or guitar with neck off. its your call.will only ship to lower 48 of USA. RETURNS ACCEPTED. no offers. thanks!", "ItemID": "153343770496", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T03:58:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-18T03:58:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1983-MIJ-IBANEZ-ROADSTAR-II-2-RS335-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-ALL-ORIGINAL-MADE-JAPAN-/153343770496", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533437704968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/G4kAAOSw5tNcQSms/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/EE0AAOSwpYxcQSmz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/7AkAAOSwvpVcQSm0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/JKgAAOSwYX9cQSmz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/W-sAAOSw8U9cQSm0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/8FEAAOSw-V1cQSm1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/WaEAAOSwKSlcQSm1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/R9wAAOSwWrxcQSm1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/GmgAAOSwPA1cQSm2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/EIAAAOSwpYxcQSnc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/aJIAAOSwzFhcQSpD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/WjYAAOSwjmFcUkEX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "19128", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thetycoons", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 287, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P12DT8H49M5S", "Title": "1983 MIJ IBANEZ ROADSTAR II 2 RS335 ELECTRIC GUITAR ALL ORIGINAL MADE IN JAPAN.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1983"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 715, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
