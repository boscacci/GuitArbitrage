{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2003 Fender Mexican Made Stratocaster Junior with Gig Bag Up for bids is a used but very clean Fender Stratocaster Jr. from 2003. Fender offered these around 2003-2007 and I don't see many around. These Strat Jr.'s were made in Mexico and show the same quality and workmanship as Fender's full size Strat models, so it's not a toy or necessarily a child's guitar like a lot of Asian import Squier short scale models. This is a 3/4 size model featuring a 22 3/4 inch scale length. It has three single coil pickups and a non-tremelo bridge. As you can see the guitar is in great shape for its age. There is a small mark in the clear lacquer on the bass side horn but that's about the only thing worth noting (and it might buff out). Any odd white spots or streaks you may see in the photos are just reflections or glare on the glossy finish. The hardware is clean, the neck is straight, and the frets are in excellent condition. Everything works as it should electronically and it's fun and easy to play. It comes with a nice fitting gig bag that's marked Squier by Fender, but again this is NOT a Squier, but a nicer Mexican made guitar. U.S. shipping will be $39 (more to Alaska and Hawaii). No international shipping.", "ItemID": "273676705931", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T03:02:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T03:02:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2003-Fender-Stratocaster-Junior-Jr-Short-22-3-4-Scale-Made-Mexico-/273676705931", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Maryville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736767059318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA4WDEzNTY=/z/kTQAAOSwcdBcRQDV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA4WDEzNTY=/z/cWsAAOSwJaxcRQDb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA4WDEzNTY=/z/MoEAAOSwhH1cRQDh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA4WDEzNTY=/z/GHYAAOSwvytcRQDn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDEyNTk=/z/0X4AAOSwjthcRQDx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDEyNTk=/z/bV8AAOSw1IhcRQDr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDEyNTk=/z/HR0AAOSwKXhcRQD2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "arbennett", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3289, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 289.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 289.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT7H53M40S", "Title": "2003 Fender Stratocaster Junior / Jr. - Short 22 3/4\" Scale, Made in Mexico", "HitCount": 91, "Subtitle": "Rare MIM 3/4 Size Strat with Gig Bag, Very Clean", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1505248", "StoreName": "arbennett"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
