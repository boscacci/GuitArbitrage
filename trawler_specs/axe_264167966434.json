Vintage 1960s-70sTeisco Made Electric Solid Body GuitarMade In Japan All Original Guitar, No Changes, Repairs or Refinishing PLEASE DO NOT mistake picture glare for flaws.. If you think your seeing something not mentioned in this listing, please ask!! There are lots of pics, so when you receive it, its exactly what you expected, if not better. No surprises with this sale.. Buy with confidence! Here's The Run Down: This is a Great Playing & Cool Sounding Vintage Unbranded, Teisco Made Electric Guitar that was played very little and still in great shape overall. The Original Sunburst Finish is in great condition for a vintage guitar. There are some minor flaws here and there as you would expect from handling, light play and age, but nothing of significance (see pics). Flaws may consist of minor scratching, scuffs, marks and/or few dings (see pics). There is minor fret wear and nothing that I would classify as actual buckle rash. The original hardware is in good condition, but does show minor wear/discoloring (pictured). The trem bar is not present. I tried to take really good pics, so you can judge for yourself (see pics). There are no changes, breaks or repairs. All electronics are original and operate perfectly. If your looking for a super cool, great playing & looking vintage guitar that wont break the bank and your friends most likely don't have, this would make a great addition to your collection! ***Will come exactly as pictured*** This guitar sounds and plays very well! Although I think its set up great, everyone has their own preferences. If your not happy with its set up, it will be your responsibility and cost to have it set up to your liking. The neck is straight and the truss rod operates as it should. All electronics are original and perfect! Freshly set up with Super Slinky 9's. Everything operates as it should, and has never had, nor does it have any breaks or repairs unless noted above.
