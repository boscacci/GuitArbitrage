The most obvious damage is the top corner of the headstock. This damage is cosmetic. The washer on the high E string is loose. I have never tried to tighten it up. The guitar has the same strings on since I've had it. The new owner can make any adjustments needed, and setup the guitar to their preference. The guitar only ships to the Continental United States.
