Poppy Red Finish! \u201cAcousti-Glass\u201d top!2018 NAMM Show Display Model!Top 40 Guitars a factory authorized Supro dealer, purchased the display models from the 2018 NAMM Music Trade Show held in Anaheim, CA. USA. These were models hanging on the wall of their display for the 4-day show from January 25-28, 2018. Some of these guitars may have been played and handled during the event. Some were never even touched. I am selling these as used guitars. They have never been sold, just been on display at the show. They still have the Factory Warranty from Supro. They still have the plastic film on the pickguard. We were able to make a below market purchase on these guitars and we are passing the savings on to you! Not a Second or Refurbished guitar. A brand New guitar that was just on display for 4-days and than sent to Top 40 Guitars! This is really cool. You are looking at a 2018 Supro Belmont Vibrato Guitar. All the Vintage Vibe in a Modern Guitar! Based on Supro\u2019s vintage res-o-glass guitar designs, the Supro Americana Series Belmont semi-hollow electric guitar combines the best of vintage appeal with modern craftsmanship. The semi-hollow mahogany back is topped with Acousti-glass, creating a swampy tone that loves distortion. A Vistatone pickup and \u201950s wiring deliver the iconic sound that put Supro on the map. From The Web:Historic Reissue The Belmont Vibrato is a reproduction of the single-pickup, Poppy Red, vibrato bar-equipped, fiberglass Supro electric guitar that was manufactured in Chicago during the early 1960s. The Belmont Vibrato reissue mates a chambered body with a newly developed, composite \u201cAcousti-glass\u201d top. This updated construction preserves the instrument\u2019s signature aesthetics and timeless sound while improving its semi-hollow acoustic resonance and tuning stability. The Belmont Vibrato\u2019s vintage-correct tuners, vibrato tailpiece and adjustable rosewood bridge are joined by a faithful replica of the legendary Vistatone pickup to bring you a fully realized and worthy reissue of this classic Supro guitar.Vistatone Pickup The Vistatone pickup found in the Supro Belmont is a reproduction of the groundbreaking, single-coil design developed for Valco by Ralph Keller in the early 1950s. The Vistatone pickup is cited as prior art in Seth Lover\u2019s PAF patent and is found in many of the most desirable vintage Supro models.Legendary Sound The Supro Belmont has an electric tone that is pure 1960\u2019s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, with an aggressive mid-range voice that does not sound like any other instrument. Our semi-hollow recipe of an Acousti-glass top and semi-hollow body retains the unique sonic characteristics of the original reso-glass models while providing today\u2019s musicians with a lightweight, highly playable instrument that stays in tune and is easy to maintain.Features:Vintage Supro body designPoppy Red finishRe-designed two-bolt neck jointVintage-correct Vistatone pickup50\u2019s-wiring volume and tone controlsRosewood bridgeVibrato tailpieceAcousti-glass topSemi-hollow mahogany backMahogany neck with dot inlays24 \u00be\u201d scale Our luthier did a complete setup.
