{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars for sale at my Ebay Store. Axes Bold As Love Guitars. Shipping to the lower 48 states only. I will not ship anywhere else. Here is a very cool Ibanez RG120 with some nice upgrades. The 24 fret neck is great with near zero fret wear. The Gloss White body looks very nice from the front but has a chip out of the back edge of the lower horn that has been touched up. Please see the pictures. I changed out the stock humbuckers for some hotter Black/ White Zebra HMV 4 wire humbuckers, about 8k-neck,15k-bridge. Then I added a push/pull tone control so that the humbuckers can be split into single coils. Along with the three way switch this gives you six different pickup combinations. I also upgraded the stock capacitor with a nice .022uf Orange Drop style epoxy film capacitor. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. All the electronics work perfectly and guitar sounds great. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. IF YOU LEFT CLICK YOUR MOUSE ON ANY OF THE PICTURES THEY WILL ENLARGE FOR A BETTER VIEW. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
