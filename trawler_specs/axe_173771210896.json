{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a 2007 Laguna LE-422 Comfort-Carved custom Design electric guitar. The color is a red flamed maple that didn\u2019t photograph well in my pictures. It is more of a nice ruby red than shown. This model was actually a higher end Laguna in the \u201cSuper Strat\u201d category. Good woods, good Alnico pickups and a Wilkinson tremelo. One volume, one tone, 5-position pickup switch, and a push-pull coil-tap for the humbucker incorporated in the tone control. The bridge is floating but I don\u2019t have the whammy bar for it. You can get a beautiful vibrato with your palm on the bridge. I typically lock the bridges down for more tuning stability, but I\u2019ll leave that up to the buyer. Fresh Ernie Ball Slinkys, truss rod adjusted, intonation adjusted, string height adjusted, fretboard conditioned, very little wear on frets, string-locking tuners working well, pickup height adjusted, electronics working well. This guitar plays great and sounds great. The harmonics are ringing and there is great sustain. I found this at a pawn shop and it was not very well taken care of. Plenty of scratches, nicks, scuffs, some rusting on the back of the tuner cases, no back cover. Someone has stamped E A D G B E on the front just below the bridge. The back of the maple neck has a long shallow crack that I\u2019m guessing is from, heat or cold or moisture. None of this is affecting play or noticeable as you play it. The guitar actually looks nice until you get within a foot or two. Check out pictures and ask questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed. All sales are intended to be final. Check our rating and feedback. I sell the guitar stuff. I pack carefully and promptly.....great guitar for cheap!", "ItemID": "173771210896", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T15:42:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T15:42:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/LAGUNA-LE422-COMFORT-CARVED-SUPER-STRAT-/173771210896", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bettendorf, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737712108968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/48UAAOSwHu5cBHVF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N~wAAOSwr-BcBHVR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zwQAAOSw~HFcBHVR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1EQAAOSwI7FcBHVX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EfEAAOSwG25cBHWW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KLUAAOSw1IhcBHVm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/U3sAAOSwGPNcBHVu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Nr8AAOSwXAxcBHV1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qcwAAOSwEvZcBHWD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uGMAAOSw~D5cBHWC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HCAAAOSwtcRcBHWM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f0EAAOSwF5hcBHU2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mychildren5-2008", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2015, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 84.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 84.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT13H28M39S", "Title": "LAGUNA LE422 COMFORT CARVED \u201cSUPER-STRAT\u201d", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Laguna"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Carved top"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["LE-422"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["La.
