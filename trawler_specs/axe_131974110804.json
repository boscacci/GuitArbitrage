Before You Bid If you have any questions, or need any additional pictures on an item we have for sale, feel free to contact us. We do our very best to accurately describe each auction and item using detailed words & pictures. If there is any discrepancy with any purchase you make, communicate with us right away because our goal is always 100% satisfaction. Perfect feedback is as important to us as it is to you, so please reach out and communicate to us any issues you may have and we will try our best to resolve any problems. If you are an International buyer, please ask for a shipping quote before bidding, because some items need to ship Fedex or UPS because of their value or size. For items listed at over $100, buyers with zero feedback should contact us before bidding or we will cancel your bid or purchase. Shipping & Payment information We accept Paypal payments only. Payment Must be Received within 3 Business Days after auction has ended. Our handling time starts once the item is paid for. We include the cost of insurance and tracking in the shipping charges. We do NOT send expensive shipments without insurance and tracking. We can only ship to addresses that are confirmed Paypal addresses. For a majority of the light weight items we prefer to ship priority mail to save you money, and if an item weighs 13 oz or less, we will ship First Class or First Class Parcel. If your item is 14 oz or more, we may be able to send your item Parcel Select which is Ebay's name for what the Post Office calls Standard Post (formerly Parcel Post). Please note that service can sometimes take up to 2 weeks for delivery and we have no control over when it will arrive. We ship heavier items Fedex because their rates are much lower for heavier items. Fedex is also used when an expensive item requires insurance and safe shipping is required. Vintage musical instruments with a value of over $1,000 will need to be shipped by UPS. We are experts at packing and shipping so your item will arrive safely and in the same condition that it left our store. International Shipping Yes we ship Internationally. Paypal payments are not accepted from all countries, so you may want to contact us before bidding to confirm if we can ship to your location. Send us your complete address and let us know if it is a business or home address. We will determine if the item should be sent Priority Mail International, Priority Mail Express, or Fedex based on its size, weight, and value. We may charge a small handling fee on top of the shipping cost for items shipping out of North America. This handling charge will be shown in our auction. This handling fee covers the extra time to fill out all of the extra paperwork. Please ask for an International shipping quote before bidding. For orders that are shipped outside of the United States there may be local customs or duties. Please be aware that all countries have different fees and procedures for incoming packages. Please check with your country\u2019s customs office for precise charges before placing your bid. We ship international shipments with duty and taxes unpaid. You are responsible to pay all duties, taxes, VAT, etc. imposed by your local government when the package arrives in your country. We cannot control delays due to customs in your country.
