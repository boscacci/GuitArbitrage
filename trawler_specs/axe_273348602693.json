{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Washburn WI-64 which is comparable, at least in Washburn's planning, to the SG. Maybe even a little better than the Epiphone imports. Its a well balanced instrument at least in music styles. It has a feature known as Voice Contour Control which in theory dials back the humbuckers to emulate single coil pickup sound. I've played metal on it as well as big band jazz. My understanding is that the body material is mahogany and it has a set neck. It does have a small scratch on the top of the head stock which it had when I bought it new. I will include the deluxe, very well built, gig bag. Thanks for your consideration.", "ItemID": "273348602693", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T15:21:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-07-10T15:21:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-WI-64-Antique-Bronze-Finish-/273348602693", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Rock Hill, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2733486026938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/eP4AAOSwaK1bRMh9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/J3cAAOSwaeRbRMjB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/jd0AAOSwRTtbRMjx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/saUAAOSwmHdbRMke/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/AGQAAOSwqRBbRMlE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/c9MAAOSw1rBbRMlu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "29730", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "orrumm", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 75, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT13H1M59S", "Title": "Washburn WI-64 Antique Bronze Finish", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["WI-64"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 646, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
