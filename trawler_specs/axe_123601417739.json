Both are included. SG Special The Epiphone SG Special is an incredible way to get real SG tone and styling without breaking the bank.

That new design soon became known as the \"SG\" which is now--along with the original--Les Paul, the iconic rock guitar. Epiphone's G-400 and G-310 SG models have been best sellers in the guitar market for over 15 years featuring the carved SG-body shape and SG sound at a \"workingman's\" price.
