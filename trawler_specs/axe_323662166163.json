{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Relisted due to international bidder. Will not ship out of the USA. Thanks for checking out my auction. Ok let me start by saying if your looking for a perfect showroom quality guitar PLEASE DON'T BID!!!! Guitar has several starches, dings and nicks/cracks.. This was a Project guitar I bought years ago and after putting together and playing for awhile it's just been hanging up on the wall as part of my collection. That being said this was a part's guitar which my definition means I bought it in parts and assembled myself. Body I believe is a Striker or Focus, the finish on the back is not the best, could use a good buff and polish. I added the holoflash film to the front (Not covered in clear coat, you don't normally cover it). First time ever doing this Holoflash but I think it turned out pretty good. I don't remember where the neck came from but it's all original with Kramer tuners and straight. Same with the Neck plate. Has a Floyd Rose Special and a Jackson Humbucker. Guitar has seen it's fair share of use but not abuse. Sounds and plays decent, Looks great! Since the guitar has been hanging for some time it will definitely need a good setup, Such As: new strings, bridge adjustment and cleaning. Gig bag will be included. Guitar will be packed very well and insured. !!!!!USA BIDDERS ONLY!!!!! No Returns! This guitar has been described to the best of my knowledge and accurate detail along with photo's from all views. Please ask any questions before bidding.", "ItemID": "323662166163", "EndTime": "2019-02-22T02:25:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-23T02:25:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kramer-HoloFlash-Guitar-Project-Parts-Playable-L-K-/323662166163", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Columbus, Mississippi", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236621661638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NjU=/z/cHIAAOSwhexcOqLq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/614AAOSwUHBcOqMA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDI4/z/2PUAAOSwXh9cOqMX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcz/z/OlIAAOSwnKFcOqMo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/wNkAAOSwa55cOqkN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/croAAOSwJ3RcOqR6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jbgAAOSw4ohcOqSD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/njMAAOSwna5cOqN6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NTc=/z/siQAAOSwrm5cOqOL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xoEAAOSwD1pcOqQH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/n-kAAOSw5wJcOqmk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JvYAAOSw~5dcOqPu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "39705", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "marty-5", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 920, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P17DT7H38M24S", "Title": "Kramer HoloFlash Guitar/Project/Parts/Playable...
