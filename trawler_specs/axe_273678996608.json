{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1941/1942 Sears Roebuck Silvertone Radio/Record Player Model 7054. This Gem was found in the rafters of an old barn. The cloth covering the wiring is dry rotted and falling apart. We made sure all of the exposed wiring was not touching, plugged it in and still works but there is a loud buzzing noise. The turntable works, it turns when the needle arm is picked up and moved toward the turntable. The power knob is pulled out from the case and bent a little but turns on and off nicely. The tuning knob needs repaired, I could see that the cable going to the knob was dry rotted and broken. There are minor scratches on the wooden case. The plastic window covering the radio station dial looks like it shrank (maybe from heat and humidy and then cold). The cloth covering the speaker is dry rotted and torn. Considerly its age and where it was stored this old Silvertone is in great shape. I don't think it would take too much to have it working like new.", "ItemID": "273678996608", "EndTime": "2019-02-06T20:30:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T20:30:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1941-42-Sears-Roebuck-Silvertone-Radio-Record-Player-Model-7054-/273678996608", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Charleston, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736789966088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4NFgxNjAw/z/vFcAAOSwv0db7yyf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUyOVgxNjAw/z/StgAAOSwcOZb7yy0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQxNFgxNjAw/z/3qMAAOSwydZb9ILU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xdEAAOSwMhVb7yyn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4OVgxNjAw/z/cfgAAOSwwdNb7yyu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0MFgxNjAw/z/GbcAAOSwyUFb7yyy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0wEAAOSwa6Jb7yyr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMTkz/z/6IsAAOSwKO5b9ILi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzk0/z/5-sAAOSw3S5b9ILo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0hQAAOSw8cFb9IL0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LmMAAOSwv0db9IRm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZqIAAOSwWIJb9IRt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "25387", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "randdie2016", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 110, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 50.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 50.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P2DT30S", "Title": "1941/42 Sears Roebuck Silvertone Radio/Record Player Model 7054", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Silvertone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["7054"]}]}, "HitCount": 14, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 50.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
