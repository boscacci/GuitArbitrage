{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A cool guitar for a beginner or anyone looking for something a little different. This was a 2008 SSS configured guitar that I modified. It now has a single H configuration with 3-ply pickguard (the plastic is still on the pickguard), a Squier Telecaster humbucker pickup has been added. All other parts are from a 2008 Squier Standard Stratocaster. The pickup reads 9.7K ohms. The pots were changed to CTS 500K with a roll-off capacitor (treble bleed). This allows the player to roll back the volume without losing treble (custom designed roll-off cap by TR Guitars in Tustin, CA.). The body has some nicks and scratches, mostly on the outside edges, but nothing major. It has no serial number, therefore, no traceability. The previous owner had painted the front of the headstock and added decals. I am not one for counterfeit decals. I stripped the neck, gave it an antique tint, and sealed it with a thin satin coat. The back of the neck has been buffed, for a smooth, fast feel. The fingerboard and frets are in very good condition. The action is set low, with no buzzing or dead spots and the intonation is dead-on. The tuners hold tune well for stock tuners. The body is also 1-3/4\" thickness, opposed to the thin Bullet/Affinity type. The neck joint is tight, with no stress cracks and the truss rod functions. The guitar has been polished, the neck has been treated, and it is set upset up with a new set of Ernie Ball 9s. The guitar has a monster sound and looks very cool, as well. The tremolo bar is included. No case or bag included, but I am including a strap and patch cable. The guitar will ship insured, via UPS ground, to the U.S. 48 contiguous states only. The shipping cost will be between $25-$65, depending on your location. I'll be happy to quote shipping costs ahead of time, just submit your city and zip code. Winning bidders: please do not check out prior to receiving an invoice with the proper shipping charges. Please ask all questions prior to bidding. PayPal only, due within 48 hours. The guitar pictured is described accurately and sold \"as is\".
