It also has a dent in the top neck binding near the first fret, which may affect play-ability. Besides these three blemishes the guitar is in great condition. Very classic guitar! The guitar comes made out of a thick flametop maple cap (NOT a veneer!) and mahogany body. The neck is also a mahogany set neck. It also has a dark rosewood fretboard. The flame maple top is stained with a gold sunburst that fades to black, which looks amazing against the red stained mahogany backside. This is such a great vintage look for this style of guitar. The fretboard is rich and dark which also gives an excellent contrast to the shine of the highly detailed pearloid inlays. This guitar has two Stellar OSR humbucker pickups. These pickups give the guitar long sustains that sound excellent with a classic tone that is exactly what you would expect from this kind of guitar. The D-Shape slimline neck is as fast as you are.
