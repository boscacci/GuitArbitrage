{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Bid with confidence, I have been selling on Ebay for 20 Years and have 100% positive feedback. Slick SL-52 from Guitar Fetish. This is a project only because it needs new pickups. Everything else is fine. These are extremely well-made inexpensive guitars, I have used it for band practice and it's very solid. This particular one has had the pickups removed. Someone made it string through at one point then filled holes and returned to original format, doesn't make a difference really since it's the worn distressed finish but if you look you can see it. Nice feeling neck set up recently with low action and good intonation. This is from their website: What's the formula for incredible LP sound?? Oh how about using the BEST wood... The BEST hardware...The BEST tuners....The BEST pickups...And finish it off with the thinnest finish, hand massaged to give you the warm, silky, old-school feel of a guitar that's been on tour for a while. Yeah that's how we do it. DO NOT underestimate this guitar just because it's so ridiculously affordable. Look- This is the real deal. Designed by Earl Slick in his New York studio. Each body is SOLID swamp ash. Necks are SOLID Canadian Hard Rock Maple. Fingerboards are Indian Rosewood. This is a serious recipe for tone. Hardware? You want Hardware? Slick spec'd out the best. It all starts with our wraparound bridge- machined from a solid billet of BRASS- No finish. Raw. Naked. Nude. The knob is a machined brass billet piece as well. Just one volume, but an elongated control cavity so you can add a tone control if you want. The tuners are our own design, with a bronze crown gear and bronze pinion gear and SOLID BRASS knob- the result is a tuner with basically NO backlash. It's smooth and very accurate, and you'll stay in tune! We put a graphite nut on every neck, hand slotted. The tilt-back headstock allows us to get the exact correct string break at the nut for ALL SIX STRINGS, and no string trees mean better tuning stability. Each Slick Guitar is equipped from the Factory with New York made D'Addario EXL110 strings. We're running a Gibson-Standard 24 3/4\" scale length, a 43mm wide nut and a 12\" fretboard radius. The neck has twenty two nickel-silver 6105 profile medium jumbo frets, leveled, crowned and polished Neck will be separated from the body for shipping purposes. A setup will be required to get it back together correctly", "ItemID": "202582033347", "EndTime": "2019-02-07T00:23:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T00:23:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Slick-SL-52-Project-No-Pickups-Xavier-/202582033347", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cumberland, Rhode Island", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025820333478080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yxwAAOSwPmBcUj8w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Lr0AAOSwpptcUj8t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KtYAAOSwtGtcUj8u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oFkAAOSwVH9cJEI4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lacAAOSwkHxcJEI-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2NsAAOSwT5tcT1wZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RTQAAOSwKV9cT1wc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/374AAOSwjW9cT1we/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "02864", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "70corin", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3129, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1623}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT22H4M35S", "Title": "Slick SL-52 Project No Pickups Xavier ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Slick"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SL-52"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 93, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 100.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "see description", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
