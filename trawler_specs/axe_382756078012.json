{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Stage Guitars Electric Guitar Model GT 302 Custom Arlington Texas USA with a Micro tilt in the neck heel. Plays and sounds great!! Rare Brand, not a whole lot of Tele Copy Customs out there of this brand and this is the only one I have seen like it. Shows some signs of light wear with a few dings and scratches. There isn't a lot of info on these on the internet, but from what there is, I think these were imported and the distributor was located in Arlington. Notice all these models names were based on popular car engines, which really makes them unique.", "ItemID": "382756078012", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T23:32:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T23:32:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Stage-Guitars-Electric-Guitar-Model-GT-302-Custom-Arlington-Texas-USA-Micro-tilt-/382756078012", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Smith, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3827560780128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTY4WDE2MDA=/z/t5oAAOSwAwFaypA3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0NVgxNjAw/z/vlIAAOSwVElaypBA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4OVgxNjAw/z/vKAAAOSwC-xaypBD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Q9oAAOSwMB9aypBG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ZSMAAOSw1m9aypBJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/nmYAAOSwPI1aypBL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/uaoAAOSwTRVaypBO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/dJYAAOSwWCBaypBQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/qAoAAOSwQPtaypBT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/utsAAOSwCERaypBW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/SBMAAOSwMGBaypBZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/7-QAAOSwlJ1aypBb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "72903", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "musiciansguitaroutletonline", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4573, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "SE", "BE", "FR", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "MX", "NZ", "CH", "NO", "UA", "HR", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BM", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "KY", "LI", "LU", "MC", "MQ", "NI", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT21H12M", "Title": "Stage Guitars Electric Guitar Model GT 302 Custom Arlington Texas USA Micro tilt", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["STAGE GUITARS"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["GT-302"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 36, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=19967720", "StoreName": "Musicians Guitar Outlet"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Asia", "Middle East", "Southeast Asia", "RU"], "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Plays and sounds great!!
