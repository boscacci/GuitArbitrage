{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a 2006 Schecter Gryphon in a flamed maple translucent brown. It\u2019s a very nice looking great playing, great sounding guitar in great used condition...ready to perform. Features include mahogany body, arched maple top, maple neck, rosewood fretboard, 24 jumbo frets, powerful Duncan Designed pickups with a push-pull coil splitting tone knob, Grover tuners, tune-o-magic bridge, and string through design. I have tightened everything up, oiled the fretboard, tweaked the truss rod, adjusted intonation, and adjusted the pickup heights. Action is low and fast on a very comfortable neck, fretboard and frets are in excellent condition, electronics work as they should, tuners work smoothly and firm. Harmonics are ringing and sustain is good. Good sounding pickups that cover a wide range of clean and sweet to powerful distortions, single coil to humbucking. This is a very nice used piece with one good ding on the front edge near the tone knob, a little very light scratching on the top side, some scratching and light dings on the back side....all in all a very presentable, stage-worthy guitar. Check out my pictures carefully and ask questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed. Check out our eBay rating and feedback, I sell the guitar stuff. I ship promptly, carefully and insured. Sale is intended to be final. Thanks for looking......", "ItemID": "183662193664", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T02:22:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T02:22:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/SCHECTER-GRYPHON-2006-KOREA-EXCELLENT-/183662193664", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bettendorf, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836621936648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UqcAAOSwbIZcS6Ls/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nMEAAOSwqoxcS6L1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HJQAAOSwa1hcS6L3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ys0AAOSwjfBcS6L8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9YIAAOSwdwVcS6L-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uUMAAOSwaEdcS6MM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PI0AAOSw2fpcS6MR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UbMAAOSw3s9cS6MU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Oj4AAOSwJOJcS6MZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IXkAAOSwPVFcS6Mi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8poAAOSwBjxcS6Mn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2LYAAOSw66JcS6Mv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mychildren5-2008", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2015, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT2M9S", "Title": "SCHECTER GRYPHON 2006 KOREA EXCELLENT", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Schecter"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Gryphon"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Coil-tap"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Trans Brown"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Diamond Series"]}]}, "HitCount": 12, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=847815792", "StoreName": "Bargain Charlie&#39;s"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Looks great, plays and sounds excellent", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
