Original Volume and Tone Knobs Has a tremolo bridge with brass saddles (we do not have the trem arm) So no trem arm will come with it. The body has some small \"drilled holes\" on the top face -- We don't know what the deal was with that But the body is in great shape for it's age. The finish is a cool looking Vintage 3 tone sunburst The neck has an issue --- It's a maple fingerboard, with little to no fret wear It has a nice non-original well installed Brass nut on it The neck is going to need some work It frets out above the 10th fret or so.
