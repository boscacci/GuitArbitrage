Please feel free to contact us by Ebay at any time. Please do not contact us directly with any pre-purchase questions or requests for information, we will only respond to Ebay-sent mail as this is a trail for Ebay representatives to follow if there is any issues after the sale. 3. We are a very honest and legitimate seller. We take pride in everything we sell and advertise. We legally purchase all of our items. We describe our items as accurately as we can. New is new. We have a very small profit margin, so if an item is advertised for a large reduction one has to believe this person is not selling it to lose money. We are sure you, as the consumer, do not want to be part of any illegal activity. If you have found a similar item we sell at a significant price reduction, there is usually a good reason and requires general common sense. PAYMENT 1. We only accept PayPal for shippable orders. IL residents will be charged 7% sales tax. We will accept cash for local pick-up orders. The acceptance of cash at time of pick-up is at our discretion. 2. If bidding on an auction item or submitting a Best Buy offer, you are agreeing to make payment for that amount plus any applicable shipping fees and taxes. If you are not interested in purchasing an item, please do not bid or submit an offer. If you are the winning bidder or your offer is accepted and payment is not made within two (4) business days, we will file a no payment strike and open a no payment case with Ebay. 3. We will only ship to the address that is on your Paypal payment. 4. We will process and ship your item within one (1) business day of your payment clearing. Paying with PayPal by check will delay the process, as this may take up to five (5) business days for the payment to clear. SHIPPING 1. We primarily use USPS for our shipping. If you require shipping via UPS or FEDEX, please let us know prior to purchase so we can get you a quote for the shipping. If you want it shipped a certain way, and it is not the way we are going to ship it anyways, let us know prior to purchase so we can get you a quote for the shipping. In some cases, we will use UPS for large or heavy items as that is the most cost effective way to ship. 2. Free shipping is free to you, the buyer; it is NOT free for us, the seller. Contrary to popular belief EBay does not offer sellers free shipping. As such, when an item is advertised with free shipping, please take that into account when comparing prices. On average, free shipping can account for between 50% and 80% of the asking price of an item.
