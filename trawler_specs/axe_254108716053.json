{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "BuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 135.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "Description": "Washburn KC-Ltd Chicago Series. H-S-S configuration. I bought this used as a restoration project, however it played great as it came, so I didn't want to take it apart. I was told that it has pickups from a Yamaha RGZ112, which sound awesome. This was repainted a metal flake deep blue. There are three minor scuffs to the finish, hardly noticeable unless up close. I tried to show this in the pictures. This has a 22 fret thin profile low-action neck with a gloss maple fingerboard. There is very minor fret wear on frets 1-7, however no dead spots or fret buzz; plenty of life left. Width at the nut is standard 43mm. The truss rod plate is missing, but you can find these on Ebay inexpensively if you want to cover it up. The body is slightly thinner at 1 9/16, similar to some early 90's Korean made Squiers. All electronics function properly. There are two chrome knurled knobs - one for volume and the tone controls the middle pickup. The output from the bridge pickup is hot (over 14K) and will give you great dynamic expression.", "ItemID": "254108716053", "BuyItNowAvailable": true, "ConvertedBuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 135.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "EndTime": "2019-02-11T04:30:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-04T04:30:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-KC-Ltd-Chicago-Series-/254108716053", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Huntersville, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2541087160538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lXcAAOSwV0NcToGS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Tt8AAOSwAGFcToGP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9zwAAOSw-iZcToGR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Vv0AAOSw1T1cToGP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Y58AAOSwe~lcToGR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-IsAAOSw1vxcToGS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mKcAAOSwgGhcToGQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KDoAAOSwI-tcToGQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fLcAAOSwSONcToGT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J8YAAOSwQGFcToGU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BcQAAOSwsrlcToIZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rZMAAOSw~VBcToI6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28078", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "beswede58", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 40.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 40.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P6DT8H1M22S", "Title": "Washburn KC-Ltd Chicago Series", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}]}, "HitCount": 9, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 40.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
