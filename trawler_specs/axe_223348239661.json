{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Epiphone presents the Ltd. Ed. James Bay Signature \"1966\" Century Outfit, an incredibly accurate recreation of GRAMMY nominee James Bay's customized 1966 Epiphone Century arch top in an Gloss Cherry finish. Featuring a Kinman\u00ae Noiseless \"Sweet Neck\" P-90, a reissue of the 60s era compensated floating bridge with brass wheels, a James Bay \"Hat Man\" head stock logo, Wilkinson Deluxe machine heads, USA made \"CTS\" 500K pots. The Ltd. Ed. James Bay Signature \"1966\" Century Outfit is both a time machine to 1966 and an exact replica of Bay's customized stage and studio guitar. The Signature Century's Laminated Maple body top, back, and sides measure to the exact profile of Bay's original which was made at the historic Epiphone and Gibson factory Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1966. Bay's new Signature Epiphone Century is finished in a Cherry gloss finish with cream binding on the body top and back. The Mahogany neck is glued to the body at the 14th fret with a Mortise and Tenon joint and has the identical \"C\" profile and dimensions and Delrin ivory colored nut found on Bay's stage guitar. The fingerboard has Mother of Pearl \"Dot\" inlays, a 25.5\" scale length, and 20 medium frets. Kinman\u00ae Custom No Hum P-90 Pickup!: James Bay customized his new Epiphone Signature Century archtop with the same hand-wound pickup he uses in his vintage Century, a Kinman\u00ae \"Sweet Neck\" P-90 Hx Noiseless Single-Coil. Kinman\u00ae pickups are world renown for their incredible sonic palate and \"no hum\" performance. Bay chose the Kinman for its classic P-90 tone and the additional reduction of hum necessary when playing the world's biggest outdoor festivals and indoor stages. The Kinman\u00ae \"Sweet Neck\" P-90 Hx is the only P-90 style pickup currently in production that maintains the dynamic range and tonal characteristics of prized vintage Gibson P-90 pickups while providing hum free operation.", "ItemID": "223348239661", "EndTime": "2019-02-07T03:17:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-28T03:17:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-James-Bay-guitar-/223348239661", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Morgan Hill, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233482396618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDk2MA==/z/pI4AAOSwU0hcTnK~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GPkAAOSwHDdcTnIj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDMyWDY1MA==/z/1xMAAOSwBjxcTnIT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oDwAAOSw10VcTnIq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aJ8AAOSw84ZcTnIz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-84AAOSwgfRcTnJD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zgAAAOSwjF9cTnJJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cMkAAOSwBwZcTnJQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aKkAAOSw84ZcTnI9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95037", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "misled1313", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 787, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 201.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 201.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***3", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P2DT8H35M5S", "Title": "Epiphone James Bay guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 79, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 204.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "great condition, no scratches, no nicks, no marks", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
