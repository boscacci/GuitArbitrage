{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Winter Bound Arch Quilt Top with some nice upgrades. The 22 fret maple/rosewood neck neck has zero fret wear, and dot inlays,jumbo frets and a 24 3/4 inch scale length . The High Gloss Body looks very nice just mild surface scratches. Guitar features string thru the body tunematic style bridge. Guitar features all gold hardware. The pickups are hot HMV Cream Hex Pole 4 wire humbuckers,8k-neck, 15k-bridge. I added a push/pull tone control so that the humbuckers can be split into single coils. This gives you six different pickup combinations when used with the three way toggle switch. The capacitor has been upgraded with a Orange Drop Style .022uf capacitor,more range of tone control and a smoother response. Guitar looks,plays, and sounds great Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
