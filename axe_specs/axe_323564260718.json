{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a beautiful Fender Aerodyne Telecaster in barely-played condition. The only blemishes, as shown in the pictures, are a tiny ding on the headstock, and some imperceptible dots where the pickguard would be as well as near the jack, though you can only really see the body marks if you look closely. This is a great lightweight Tele, super sleek looking, doesn\u2019t feel stiff, with a natural feeling fretboard. They were only made for a short time in the early-2000s, and this seems to be the rarest model of the bunch. And it comes with a great case! If you want a nice Tele, something beautiful looking with that Tele sound, but don\u2019t like some of the less comfortable build elements (or price tag) of some of the higher-end Tele\u2019s, this is the guitar for you.
