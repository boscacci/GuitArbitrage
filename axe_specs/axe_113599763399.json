{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Danelectro 1958 to early 60's Double Cut-Away \"Short Horn\" Solid Body Guitar. Danelectro started in 1954 and this model was introduced in 1958. I believe it was called the Standard Short Horn 3011. in 1956 the \"Lipstick\" pickups were introduced and the Poplar body was covered by masonite. The sides are covered by a vinyl material. This one has a non-adjustable steel truss rod, a aluminum nut, and a stainless steel bridge. The headpiece is known as the \"coke bottle\" because of its shape. This guitar may have the straightest neck I've seen on an old electric. The \"Lipstick\" pickups and the tuners work as they should, the action is low with no buzzing, the white plastic knobs are good, and the finger board shows very little wear. It stays in tune and plays fine. The body was painted sometime in the past as the original colors were either black or white. See the photos that show the wear on the bottom edges of the body. So as well as being quite collectible this eclectic guitar is also a player. If you have any questions contact me.
