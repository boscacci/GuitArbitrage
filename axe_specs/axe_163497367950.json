{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale here is a Honey Blonde Highway one Fender Telecaster Guitar with a nitro finish.The Highway One line has a very good reputation and are sought after instruments. The neck is a made in USA Warmoth with a 9.5\" radius.I believe the guitar is a 2003 model, at least that is what the previous owner told me.I bought it used in 2013 and changed most of the hardware to gold and I also changed the pickupsto a Seymour Duncan Jerry Donahue for the bridge position and a Dimarzio Twang King in the neck position.It has a bone nut and the case is a good hard shell case that is like new.There are a few minor paint chips but it is in pretty nice overall condition.The action is nice and low at about 1/16\" at the twelfth fret on the low E string.Not much fret wear, just a little. Anyway to sum it up a great looking guitar that sounds and plays just as great as it looks.", "ItemID": "163497367950", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T01:26:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T01:26:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-Highway-One-Guitar-/163497367950", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Glentworth", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634973679508080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/K0cAAOSwkDtcOhfx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/LeMAAOSwLr1cOhfz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/hT4AAOSwS3lcOhf2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/6-AAAOSwqRlcOhf6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/8jMAAOSwr~9cOhf9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/BNAAAOSw0xtcOhgB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/38cAAOSwN5hcOhgF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/SL8AAOSwf1xcOhgJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/gUoAAOSworNcOhgN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/x8kAAOSw27lcOhgT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/dUwAAOSwwkRcOhgW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "S0H 1V0", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ed9383", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 507, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 648.62, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 860.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 232}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster Highway One Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 525, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 870.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very Good Condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
