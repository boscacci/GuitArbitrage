All pots are A500k. The master volume has a treble bleed circuit. The varitone is 6 way. The caps are .0022, .0047, .0068, .022, .047 and .15 These all run through a 2.6h choke. The volume for the varitone is converted to be noload so when it's turned all the way up it bypasses the entire tone circuit. You can feel a notch when you turn it up so you know it's in bypass. The varitone has a volume control so you can blend in how much of the tone you want from the varitone switch. The pot behind the master volume is a bass cut. This works well when playing with lots of distortion and saturation to clean up your tone for leads. You can also combine this pot with the varitone to give you tons of tone combinations.", "ItemID": "153298098845", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T15:54:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T15:54:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Warmoth-Double-cut-DC-LP-Style-Custom-Electric-Guitar-Varitone-/153298098845", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532980988458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qqEAAOSwfMlcDoio/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UmwAAOSwN5hcDojg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9BUAAOSwIsdcDolD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3qQAAOSwxFVcDoj8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bEcAAOSw4m9cDol0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zygAAOSwEJ1cDom3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t~oAAOSwtcRcDonm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3b0AAOSwFURcDooc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vgYAAOSw8hdcDohd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8voAAOSwC45cDoh3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zSAAAOSwrQxcDopc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PMEAAOSwCXFcDoqg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "46256", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jcosta1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1317, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 825}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Warmoth Double-cut DC LP Style Custom Electric Guitar with Varitone", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Warmoth"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Clear"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Double Cut"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 699, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
