{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "ORIGINAL RARE VINTAGE 1952 KAY K-125 Stratotone Electric Guitar \"Peanut\" KAY's 1st SOLID BODY w/Case! Very rare and hard to find guitar! I have not seen any like this one listed! Offering as a project. Approx. 37\" long. Approx. 10 1/2\" wide lower bout. Tobacco Sunburst! I believe this guitar is original throughout as shown. Original Kluson tuners working condition but buttons brittle or missing and surface rust as shown. Original tortoise pickup ring and control plate, knobs, switch good working condition. Original Kay Jimmy Reed style pickup...plugged in and seems to pick up sound and project as it should. Original connected cord with some minor rust but working condition. No guarantees on electronics, but all seems in good working condition! Original Kay headstock plate! Original bridge in good condition. Original tailpiece a little rusty as shown. Body is solid with minor separation showing at bottom of back around tailpiece area...but feels tight (I believe the neck was one piece continuing and making up the middle part of the body. Then 2 sides of body were added!). Neck appears straight and nice and tight (appears part of body...I think these were made that way). Looking down fretboard showing maybe some very slight curve, but not too much. Action measures approx. 1/8\" or so at the 14th fret. Old strings will need replaced of course. Some wear to frets, not much to board itself. As you can see, there are scuffs, nicks and some edge wear as shown. The picture of the back shows the most wear along edges...the edges themselves are not worn down bad...mainly the surface finish as shown. These first Kay made solid body guitars were much revered for their tone. Great little electric for vintage blues! One of the preferred style guitars of the great Elmore James! Pretty rare and highly sought after today! Being offered as shown as a project with no returns or refunds. Can certainly be cleaned up. This is a great candidate for complete restoration! Comes with nice old chipboard case as shown and will pack with great care as always. Buyer pays shipping plus applicable insurance. PLEASE wait for invoice at end of auction which will include insurance. No international shipping. Please email with any questions. PLEASE MAKE AN OFFER! When will you have the opportunity to get another one?
