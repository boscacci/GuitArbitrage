This guitar is in excellent condition for being over 10 years old. It has no headstock breaks, cracks or repairs. The guitar has some light micro scratches on the top and back and that's about it - see pics. The bridge has a little fading of the gold plating. All the electronics work as intended and the neck is straight. It has the Gibson 490R and 490T humbuckers and they sounds really nice. It has an ebony fingerboard. It has just been deep cleaned and detailed. The front, back, sides and neck were waxed and buffed with a high grade carnuba wax. The frets were polished and the fingerboard was cleaned, buffed and moisturized with an instrument grade lemon oil. It was set up with 10/46's, adjusted and plays very nicely. All the electronics work well. She weighs 8.2 lbs and has a medium neck profile. Comes with the Gibson hardshell case as seen in the pictures. This guitar will be safely packed and shipped.
