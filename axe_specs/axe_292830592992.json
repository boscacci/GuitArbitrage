Thanks For Looking & Happy Bidding.On Nov-27-18 at 08:04:16 PST, seller added the following information: Hi All, A kindly Ebayer sent me a little more info. about this guitar so here it is: I thought you should know that yours is a Lone Star Strat. I've owned quite a few of them over the years - I still have one. Anyway, Fender introduced these in 1996 along with the Road House and Big Apple Strats. These were some of the better Strats Fender produced at the time. The Road House had three single coil Texas Special pickups. The Big Apple had two Seymour Duncan Humbuckers. The Lone Star (yours) had two Texas Special single coils and the Seymour Duncan in the bridge position. They were only produced from 1996 to 2000/2001. Later, Fender produced a series of \"Fat Strats\" and Road House Strats that were Mexican made and FAR below the quality of the USA series. Might help a little if you included some of this in your description -- for sure add \"Lone Star\" to your description. Folks who know Fender (like myself) already know what they're looking at here - others may not.", "ItemID": "292830592992", "EndTime": "2018-11-28T21:00:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-23T21:00:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-USA-Fender-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar-Hard-Case-Very-Good-Condition-/292830592992", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Harlem, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928305929928080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTkwWDE2MDA=/z/2PoAAOSw2~Nb9b6D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NjA=/z/HL4AAOSwFAtb9b6h/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg0MzA=/z/nhsAAOSwUBtb9b6o/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MjQ=/z/uucAAOSwyApb9b6y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NjY=/z/OcAAAOSw-FRb9cA0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQyNFgxNjAw/z/5SsAAOSwZtRb9cBO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTM3/z/efwAAOSw1IVb9cBj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzUx/z/H9gAAOSwsupb9cB7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTIy/z/Q6YAAOSwmXpb9cCV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjc0/z/y9YAAOSwQtdb9cCn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjQ4/z/TJMAAOSwaXpb9cC6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIzWDE2MDA=/z/4rYAAOSwenJb9cDL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "30814", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pawnking2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3690, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 26, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 706.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 706.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1338}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 USA Fender Stratocaster Electric Guitar & Hard Case Very Good Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 652, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 716.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very Good Condition, Shows Normal Wear, SEE PICTURES!!!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
