{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Nice Lefty OLP Guitar Licensed by Ernie Ball (MM-1) Probably from 2007 or so... These guitars are pretty good for the price, if you like Music Mans and do not want to pay big $$$. This guitar is good enough for gigs or just practice. The pickups are suprisingly hot. The sustain is good. I do not think that they are made anymore... This one is in good shape and plays/sounds pretty good. It currently has .09s on it. No major cosmetic issues or playing issues, but depending on you playing preferences, you might want to have a pro setup done for optimal playability. I personally think it is good where it is, but I figured I should say that. The trem block where the top spring was connected broke, so I have the spring connected to the next one which seems to make no difference...the ground wire on the trem also separated from the solder joint, so I just connected it to a spring which works just fine. Also, no trem arm. The Roadrunner gig bag is practically new. I willbe sure to safely pack the guitar for gig bag shipping. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. $39.99 S&H", "ItemID": "153330798245", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T02:39:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T20:42:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Left-Handed-OLP-MM-1-Music-Man-Electric-Guitar-w-Roadrunner-Gigbag-Lefty-VH-LH-/153330798245", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Overland Park, Kansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533307982458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UH8AAOSwc9VcMmN8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM2Mlg5MDE=/z/qUgAAOSwUm5cMmNs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UvkAAOSwI9FcMmOK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZDoAAOSwRY1cMmOU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qioAAOSwK9ZcMmOn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/27oAAOSwH2VcMmO2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cSEAAOSwLDlcMmPG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUyWDExMDE=/z/tYcAAOSw5wFcMmPl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4Nlg5NzE=/z/rPMAAOSwjwZcMmQI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/E5gAAOSwzhFcMmQm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J3EAAOSwusdcMmQv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QUUAAOSwzEVcMmRH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "66223", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mynewtattoo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1173, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 183}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Left Handed OLP MM-1 Music Man Electric Guitar w Roadrunner Gigbag Lefty VH LH", "HitCount": 281, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Nice shape- plays and sounds good.
