{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Listed is a 2018 Gibson Les Paul Junior guitar. I bought this new and modified it by installing a Lollar Gold Foil dog ear pickup and wired it the way '50s Juniors were originally. I also replaced the bridge with a Pigtail aluminum wraparound bridge and TonePros locking studs. I will also include the original P-90 pickup, bridge tail piece, and studs that came with the guitar, along with a prewired Junior kit from Emerson Custom and all original paperwork from Gibson. There is a crack in the paint near the volume knob, but it is not in the wood itself. I also misplaced the washer and nut for the high e string tuner. This doesn't actually affect the tuner, but it would be a good idea to put one on there. This is a limited edition Junior with the old Gibson mandolin script logo from the '40s. The guitar plays really nice and has a decent size neck. It's a very straightforward guitar with one pickup, a tone and volume knob, and the gold foil gives it a unique sound. It sounds great clean and with distortion, and still retains a good Junior sound. Please contact me with any additional questions.", "ItemID": "163355284613", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T22:57:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T22:57:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-2018-Les-Paul-Junior-Electric-Guitar-w-HSC-Modified-w-Original-Parts-/163355284613", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nashville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633552846138080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U-AAAOSwUalb33TR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/u1YAAOSwF5Vb33Uw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nPkAAOSwczdb33U3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lyUAAOSwH0Vb33U9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jFMAAOSwPrdb33VC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LygAAOSwj-Rb33VM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/q6IAAOSwrblb33VR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nJQAAOSwNptb33VX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wWQAAOSwUS1b33Vg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DbEAAOSw-4Jb33Vn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EDUAAOSwm4Zb33Tr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iXMAAOSwzZNb33Vy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37201", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mattheoconno_2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 43, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 729.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 729.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 108}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson 2018 Les Paul Junior Electric Guitar w/ HSC - Modified w/ Original Parts", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Junior"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut", "Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 482, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 739.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78630819", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "There is one crack in the paint near the volume knob and one tuner is missing the washer and nut.
