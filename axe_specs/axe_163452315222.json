{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1964 Gibson Melody Maker Electric Guitar This is a previously owned Gibson Melody Maker Electric Guitar. The serial dates the guitar to 1964 I believe. I am not the original owner so I can not speak to use and care of the guitar. I can tell you the guitar is considerably worn. The guitar has chips and checks in the finish along the edges of the body and on the head stock as well as a couple of checks in the neck. The finish has cracked with age. Tuning machines show age and are difficult to turn but do function. The back covers are missing. The neck will most likely need an adjustment. The guitar has been plugged in and the electronics are working. It is a neat piece of history, but it shows it's age for sure. It comes with a brown chipboard case. The case is beat up and shows age. Please look closely at all photos to see wear and tear. A signature will be required upon delivery. Thank you! 308323-11 Thank you for taking the time to check out our listing.
