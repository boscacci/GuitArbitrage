{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Custom Shop Les Paul Custom Exclusive Run with Case 2018 SAVE MONEY AND GET IT HERE!!! Color: Ebony with Nickel HardwareI purchased in September 2018 from AMS (authorized Gibson dealer). I have played it once. it's essentially a brand new guitar. Original price was $3,999 It's had a professional set-up from a luthier with DiAddario 10's put on. During the same trip to the luthier, I had Locking Grover tuners put on. I will send you the original tuners with the sale. Ships to you with the original Gibson box and the outer box. This guitar is a 'limited run' that came with nickel hardware. Yes, it's very rare and these usually come with boring gold hardware. This one has nickel, which is the way they should all come. The only sign of wear on the guitar is slight blue on the rear binding (I played this with a blue T-shirt). You can probably get this off if you care to. It's not even noticeable in the picture I posted (picture 7) of that area of the binding. No scratches. I ship only to the continental 48 United States. Item located in Connecticut. You can pay with PayPal or pick up locally. Shipping is $120 (flat rate) on top of the sale price. This is an expensive guitar, so let's not be cheap. I have original documentation to prove purchase from authorized Gibson dealer and to prove the September 2018 purchase date.Neck Tennon: Custom Shop LongFingerboard: RichliteScale: 24 3/4Nut: CorianInlays: Peal Split BlockFretwire: ReissueBody: Maple Top/Mahogany BackBinding: Multiple Black White Black on Fingerboard, Top, Back and HeadstockHardware: NickelMachine Heads: Grover KeystoneBridge: Tune-O-MaticTailpiece: Stop BarCase: Custom Shop Message me with any questions you may have.
