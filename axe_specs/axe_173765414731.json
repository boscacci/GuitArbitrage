{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a black Ibanez RG7421 7-string Electric Guitar with Hardshell Case. This is an early 1999 model which uses the same neck as the RG7621, one-piece maple. Later models with the RG7421 neck use a three-piece maple & bubinga, dark stripe down the length. These Japan (FujiGen factory) made models are of a much higher quality than newer models made in Indonesia and elsewhere, making them very popular among 7-stringers. Cosmetically, I would rate this guitar in Good condition. These models are notorious for chipping around the sharp body edges and dings due to the soft basswood bodies. This one is no exception, but I have used automotive touch up enamel to address any chipping. Aside from some chips and dings, there is visible buckle rash and other scratches from normal use. All in all, this guitar still has a good mirror finish on top and looks pretty good for 20 years old. Comes with and ships in a hardshell electric guitar case, which is also in good shape (sorry no keys). The starting bid is set at only $322.00 for this auction! The guitar will be well-packed and insured. This item ships to Continental US only. Check out my other listings for more good deals. Good luck and thanks for looking!
