{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "FOR LOCAL PICKUP ONLY !! Ibanez RG450DX, Black, In excellent condition. I'm listing this as used, but you really can't tell, apart from a few handling swirls in the finish, which every guitar will have after a couple of days. This is not one of the newer models with the cheaper bridge and unlabeled pickups. This is one from a few years back that still had the Ibanez INF pickups. I bought this on a whim to see if I would like and Ibanez RG, and immediately went nuts over it and bought a Prestige RG655. This one has sat in a case since, and is still in fantastic shape. No dents/dings/scratches or issues, and I did not play it enough to wear the frets. I never use the locking nut, so none of the locking screws are damaged or stripped out like you find on a lot of these. It is NOT a second. Comes with the original tremolo bar. THIS SALE IS LOCAL PICKUP ONLY. Shipping would cost upwards of 40 dollars or more on this, which I would lose, so I am offering it locally, minus the 40 dollars I would have lost on shipping, to save myself the trouble of trying to find a box to fit it. This is a great deal for YOU, if you are local enough to pick it up. I am close enough to Hickory, Boone, Blowing Rock, Morganton, and Wilkesboro North Carolina to meet you there or nearby areas for pickup. Please do not ask if I will ship the guitar. I have explained why I am avoiding that option, and will not reply to requests to ship.", "ItemID": "303009074875", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T14:56:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-26T15:07:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-RG450DX-Black-Excellent-Condition-Ibanez-INF-Pickups-/303009074875", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Lenoir, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030090748758080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cUsAAOSwZtBbR7C3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D30AAOSwDp1bR7C4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RmcAAOSwc~NbR7C2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zWQAAOSwYXBbR7C4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sLsAAOSwZb5bR7C5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/soQAAOSw2yNbR7C6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RLYAAOSwL8lbR7C5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZMcAAOSw2idbR7C5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/29cAAOSwC-JbR7C2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LhkAAOSwlVJbR7C2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yTcAAOSwFuZbR7C3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zv4AAOSwxblbR7C5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28645", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "63stratocaster", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 603, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***w", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1212}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez RG450DX, Black, Excellent+ Condition, Ibanez INF Pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 27, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 280.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
