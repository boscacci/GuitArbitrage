{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is in great shape. I acquired it from a Mom & Pop music store that went out of business. It was a display model, so it's not absolutely perfect, but it is in as good a condition as any you will find hanging on the wall at your local Guitar Center. I gave the guitar one of my \"signature\" setups that includes: New GHS Boomer 10-46 gauge strings, truss rod adjustment, intonation set, string height adjustment, fret polish, fingerboard clean and moisturize. body polish and electronics inspection. The action is low and fast with no buzzing or dead frets. Everything works just as it should and the guitar truly plays like a dream. Check my feedback here and on other sites and see what my customers say about my setups ....THEY ROCK! I normally charge $75 for setups like this guitar received. PLEASE NOT THAT MY QUOTED SHIPPING RATE IS FOR THE CONTINENTAL US ONLY. IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE LOWER 48, PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A SHIPPING QUOTE BEFORE MAKING YOUR PURCHASE.
