It has a stunning red flame top that looks a lot better in person & its semi-hollow body gives it an awesome & unique sound that voices perfectly with the Jazz Neck & Custom Custom, Seymour Duncan pickups. The neck is very smooth & plays like a dream. From the looks of the gorgeous rosewood fretboard & mahogany body, you can tell that the Washburn Custom Shop used top of the line wood in this guitar. If Sammy Hagar put his name on it, you know it has to be good!
