Pictured here we have a great deal on an authentic 2018 Gibson Les Paul Classic in Ebony. This guitar comes with a MINT Gibson Hard Case and ALL original case candy. We also ship in the guitar's original Gibson Box. This guitar is actually a new display model which has never left our store. It does have some surface scratches from normal demo play in our store. There are no chips in the paint or gashes in this guitar. Black is a tough color for scratches. In certain lighting- it looks perfect. In bright light, the scratches are more obvious. Other than that, no fret wear or war wounds. In new condition and nice and shinny. This guitar plays like butter and is an amazing buy. Tagged new in store for $2299 - but is now featured as a clearance blow out to make room for new store inventory that we are expecting. Very good looking guitar! This is the guitar of a lifetime at a blow out price! We are an authorized Gibson Dealer! Familiar Design with P-90 Tone!Gibson's Les Paul Classic 2018 solid body electric guitar blends everything we all love about '60s-era Les Pauls with a single-coil tonal twist that makes them reliable workhorses for modern guitarists. The mahogany body is still capped with the familiar maple top, and the Les Paul Classic's SlimTaper neck profile has been a favorite for years. Additions such as Grover tuners and rolled fretboard edges make the guitar incredibly comfortable. The Les Paul Classic 2018 delivers familiar feel with one of the most desirable single-coil tones out there.Legendary construction!The Gibson Les Paul Classic 2018 solid body electric guitar boasts all the features and design elements that have made the Les Paul one of the most beloved electric guitar designs in history. The single-cutaway body sings with the familiar balance of mahogany's warmth and maple's clear sustain. This non-weight-relieved body provides ultimate sustain. And the mahogany and rosewood neck is carved to Gibson's popular SlimTaper profile that feels great during chording or single-note runs.The legendary tone of P-90 pickups!Warm, creamy, shiny, and full of life, the P-90s in this Les Paul Classic 2018 capture the very essence of the classic pre-PAF P-90. Roll back the tone, keep the volume in check, and you'll have access to the liquid jazz lines Les Paul himself liked to play. Or open them up full-throttle and tap into the slightly rude and gritty tone they have to offer. As simple as they are, these classic pickups give this Les Paul Classic 2018 the wide range of classic tones you crave. Upgraded reliability!While the majority of the Gibson Les Paul Classic 2018 solidbody electric guitar features are aimed at re-creating the best aspects of vintage instruments, Gibson loaded these models with a few additions that prepare them for the demands of the modern musician.
