You are looking at a 1998 Jackson Dinky S2 Sustainiac. This is a Made In Japan Pro Series. The Jackson Dinky S2 Electric Guitar is both a looker and a screamer with Seymour Duncan pickups and flashy finishes. The Dinky 2S features Duncan's Sustainiac Driver/pickup in the neck position, STK-1 Single-Coil mid, and their JB TB4 in the bridge position. The alder body is fitted with a shred-eriffic rock maple neck and a bound compound-radius rosewood fretboard. A scalloped heel means uninhibited access to the upper frets, while a Floyd Rose double-locking trem lets you dive as deep as you want. Sustainiac vibrates the strings to produce intense, predictable, controllable feedback-sustained notes at any volume. Jackson's compound-radius fingerboard curves more dramatically at the nut for easy chording and flattens out as it approaches the neck joint for low-action bends without fretting out. With a more relaxed hand, you'll play better! Dark Blue Flame Maple Top!
