{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Share The USRG20 is an RG series solid body electric guitar model introduced by Ibanez in 1994. It is part of the USA Custom line which is a subset of the Prestige line The USRG20 features an alder body with a AA figured maple top bolted to an eastern white maple neck with a 24-fret rosewood fingerboard with offset dot position markers. Components include a low profile double locking tremolo bridge, dual Ibanez DiMarzio humbucking pickups and a locking nut. The USRG30 is a similar model with a AAA figured maple top and fretboard binding. The USRG10 is a related model with a AA figured maple top and a fixed bridge. All three of these models were produced for Ibanez by Dave Bunker's PBC Guitar Technology of Coopersburg, Pennsylvania. They were designed by Ibanez and built by PBC using their patented Tension-Free neck design.[1] The Tension Free neck design relieves the neck of all string tension. A 3/8\" steel bar inserted into the neck absorbs the tension of the tightened strings. The design allows for simple, precise adjustment of the string action.[1] The USRG20 was discontinued after 1995.
