{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Please note that I am a long-time guitar seller on eBay with over $171,000 in sales and 100% feedback!! I bought this guitar about 5 years ago when I was going through a \"metal phase\". This PRS Custom \"Special Edition\" will not only handle heavy metal....... it will scream in all of the metal genres. Condition.......... almost new. I've only played it a few times and it has never been out of my house. As I inspect it, I can't find any nicks or blemishes ........... perhaps slight polish marks on the body, but these are hard to see. Again......... I repeat, this is the closest thing to new you will find anywhere! Music Radar reviewed this PRS and here are just a few of their findings: *** \"PRS build quality and playability at a reasonable price.\" *** OUR VERDICT: \"The most impressive thing here is that, with the company's first seven-string guitar PRS has absolutely nailed it.\" For example, there's the maple cap. On the US-made Custom 24, this is a piece of highly carved, lightly carved solid maple is a deep gloss black. The parchment-colored bind around the body looks outstanding (see pics). For example, the 7-String's neck is maple rather than mahogany with a beautiful rosewood fingerboard And of course, this custom 7-string has the distinctive abalone bird inlays seen on the higher priced models. And the 7-String's neck, which is maple rather than mahogany, with a rosewood fingerboard and PRS's distinctive bird inlays. \"All 24 frets are mirror-smooth, and the double-cut body means you can get right up to the widdly high end unimpeded! And the neck, with PRS's Wide Thin carve, is almost implausibly comfortable. The 7-String's action is low, and the fretboard is comfortably rounded\"....... Music Radar The humbuckers on this guitar as also solid BLACK adding to the appearance. The pull-out tone knob also allows you to play in the single-coil mode...... an excellent addition in this package. Finally, this great metal monster has an adjustable bridge and its \"string though design\" adds to the power and sustain. But let's discuss that thumping bottom so prevalent in all kinds of metal. No 6-string guitar can match this PRS due to the tuning of the 7-string (B1\u2013E2\u2013A2\u2013D3\u2013G3\u2013B3\u2013E4). It is the low B and E that creates that sound. Keep in mind, if you only want to play with the regular 6 strings,,,,,, you can easily do it and avoid the thumping low B. Of course there are other creative ways to tune a 7-string guitar such as (CGCFADG).... check out that video on YouTube. Hook this baby up to a high-gain amp and you really will melt faces! Note... this rock solid guitar will be shipped securely in a soft-shell gigbag. These PRS Custom 24's are currently selling as high as $1049 !!!!! But as I always say..... buy from within the USA...... not Japan. Pick up the all black monster for a reasonable $470 !", "ItemID": "283158781434", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T19:10:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-13T21:35:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-SE-Custom-24-7-string-Guitar-GREAT-METAL-AND-ROCK-extra-set-pickups-/283158781434", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Vero Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2831587814348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Tv4AAOSw9wxbmT-L/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODU3WDE2MDA=/z/c~oAAOSwoIpbmT-6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAzNlgxNjAw/z/k8gAAOSwbn9bmT~j/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTg2WDE2MDA=/z/oAIAAOSwEeVbmUAI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk1WDE2MDA=/z/fVAAAOSwvGdbmUAm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/LaMAAOSwr8tbmUBF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODYyWDE2MDA=/z/oPIAAOSwEeVbmUBm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/OXsAAOSw9HZbmUCI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTc5WDE2MDA=/z/ktAAAOSw9i9bmUCd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ioUAAOSwxMRbmUEC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/HUYAAOSwjexbmUFh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAyWDE2MDA=/z/-~MAAOSwfbpbmUS5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32968", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ramdoc333bc", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1549, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.6}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 29}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS SE Custom 24 (7-string) Guitar (GREAT METAL AND ROCK): extra set of pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["PRS BadAss guitar"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 693, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
