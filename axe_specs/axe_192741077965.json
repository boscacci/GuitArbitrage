{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Stratocaster 1991/1992 Serial #N1038834 - Made in USA American Made I believe the plate on the front is missing from the pictures I have seen based on other Fender Stratocasters. This is untested as I have no way to test this. This is being sold as-is. This does have wear from use and storage. It is missing one string currently it appears. The body does have some scratching and general wear. Be sure to check the photos, the item pictured is exactly what you will receive. I am selling some very nice guitars and other musical instruments this week in auction format. Please be sure to view my other items. A couple of these guitars are very rare and very nice. A great Christmas present for yourself or someone you know. There are no returns on these musical instruments.On Dec-01-18 at 15:54:11 PST, seller added the following information: Please note, under the product specifics I have clearly selected: Modified Item: No This information that is listed below that is incorrect!!!: Modification Description: upgraded LSR rollernut upgraded Fender Superstrat Ash body upgraded pearloid pickguards (fr & back) upgraded Fender vintage bridge saddles IS NOT CORRECT AS FAR AS I KNOW. This listing was created from another listing as ebay allows and somehow they are showing this incorrect modification information even though modified item is listed as NO. I am not an expert on this item, please see the pics for what you are getting. I think it would be easy to see from the photos that those modifications listed are not on this guitar. On Dec-04-18 at 12:59:18 PST, seller added the following information: Please note, I will ship this internationally. Shipping will run around $100-125 depending upon your location for international buyers for USPS priority international. It could end up being more if you are in a remote location (Australia for example, but if you need a quote please inquire and I will respond as soon as I can). Someone asked about the chip to the edge of the guitar at the bottom. I neglected to mention this chip as I simply did not see it and am sorry for the overlook.", "ItemID": "192741077965", "EndTime": "2018-12-07T01:05:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-30T01:05:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-1991-1992-Serial-N1038834-Made-USA-American-/192741077965", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hillsborough, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927410779658080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/WW0AAOSw87Jb~wJl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/2nkAAOSw-2hb~wJq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/2WYAAOSwIsdb~wJv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/shUAAOSwTEZb~wJz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/ROIAAOSwdhdb~wJ4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/v6gAAOSwmepb~wJ9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/86cAAOSwdgxb~wKC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/61AAAOSw~flb~wKH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/nEoAAOSwUP5b~wKK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/LbUAAOSwUMBb~wKQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/4-EAAOSwGUpb~wKU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/vToAAOSwvqVb~wKZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27278", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kennybrooks", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 7269, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.1, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 34, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 755.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 755.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "z***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 22}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster 1991/1992 Serial #N1038834 - Made in USA American ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1991/1992"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["upgraded LSR rollernut \nupgraded Fender Superstrat Ash body\nupgraded pearloid pickguards (fr & back)\nupgraded Fender vintage bridge saddles"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 1129, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=243534", "StoreName": "Kenny Brooks Estate Treasures"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "I believe the plate on the front is missing from the pictures I have seen of other Fender Stratocasters.
