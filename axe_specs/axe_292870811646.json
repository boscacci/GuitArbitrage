{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Howdy, The Sitdowner model is a great guitar to sit down and play but don't worry it also is quite nice to play standing up! LoL This guitar is a one of a kind creation that has been around my shop for 6 years. This guitar has had the pickups changed several times. (pickup testing guitar) The first bridge was a stop bar, Les Paul type and then, changed to its current one, a chrome Kahler with a custom short bar. It works great. This and the new scale length explains the two pearl plugs in front of the bridge. (the bridge had to be relocated)The Fender scale 25.5 in. bolt on neck was installed in 2015 to give it great feel and balance. What it's made of: Solid Douglas Fir Top/Quartersawn (acoustic guitar Quality) braced with the same mat. Back & sides: Brazilian tiger wood/Goncolo Alves braced with the same mat. Neck: Beautiful Birdseye maple with Lacewood center Modern slim C shape NICE! Fretboard: Braz. Walnut/ Ipe Standard size frets, one way truss rod, REAL Abalone markers Body Binding: Black/white purling and Honduran Rosewood bindings AII sides. Inner body: Framework made of solid Red cedar with a solid Cedar center block (335ish) Finish: Gloss Nitro Cellulose Lacquer hand rubbed (6 years old very good shape) Neck has been rubbed out to satin finish. Electronnic's: Two Domminger Custom vintage wound Humbuckers that Are GREAT!! Master volume and tone controls with simple 3 way toggle switch. No case for this one. It will probably work best in a gig bag. It will be double boxed and shipped usps ground.This is a super fun guitar to play and it sounds great! The PU's are very feedback resistant and handles all kinds of distortion-volume very well. All the changes and upgrades have been done by myself here at SKR Guitars. I'm selling the guitar for less than parts cost just for X-mas money. Lower 48 USA only ( other places contact me about shipping cost increases & availability) please check my other actions.", "ItemID": "292870811646", "EndTime": "2018-12-22T17:29:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-15T17:29:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-SKR-semi-hollow-body-archtop-guitar-335-Kahler-vibrato-LOW-Player-/292870811646", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "South Bend, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928708116468080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/q1wAAOSwKV9cFSsE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iUEAAOSwHGxcFSsS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/q4gAAOSwKV9cFSsk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BtQAAOSwsPNcFSs9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZUwAAOSwHOZcFStP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BvQAAOSwsPNcFStX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/a4gAAOSwa55cFSrQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iMQAAOSwUWtcFStj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/M~IAAOSwcnZcFSrW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Z4AAAOSwV0VcFSuA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aWsAAOSw5cZcFpU7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "46628", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fzgeek", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 841, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 580}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom SKR semi- hollow body archtop  guitar 335 Kahler vibrato LOW$ Player!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["SKR"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Tigerwood/Douglas Fir"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Quartersawn Fir"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom 22 fret"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Clear natural"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013/2015"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["see description"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Sitdowner semi hollow"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 201, "Subtitle": "Great sounding Custom Domminger pickups Grover tuners ", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Shop-Used very good.
