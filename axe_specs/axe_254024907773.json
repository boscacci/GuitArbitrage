{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Canton Music Shoppe 149 Reinhardt College ParkwaySuite 11Canton, GA 30114 1994 Fender Telecaster Plus W/OHSC in Very Good Condition with only minor cosmetic flaws. There are a couple of small dings and very light buckle rash on the back of the guitar. There is a small scratch on the front near the rear upper bout. The Electronics work Perfectly and sound amazing. Fender's Plus series is poised to become a future classic. A great combo of top of the line features and great American made quality. The Plus series was Fender's top of the line production guitars for much of the 80s and 90s, later to be replaced by the American Deluxe guitars. This gorgeous Telecaster Plus is a rare model made for only a few years before the new Plus series hit in theMid- late 90s. The body is ash for good sound and looks. The 25.5 inch scale maple neck features a 9.5 inch radius rosewood fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets. A trio of Lace Sensor pickups offer powerful tone with very little noise. The bridge is a Red Dually Lace Sensor while Blue topped Lace Sensor occupy's the neck position. A factory toggle lets you split the Dually pickup. A 6 saddle string through bridge and sealed tuners team up for rock solid performance.
