{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1973 Guild S-100, Black, s/n 84273, w/hardshell case. Vintage S-100, great player. Well used with plenty of little dings and nicks around nearly every edge, and a nice patch of buckle rash on the back, all of which adds a cool vibe. All hardware is in pretty good condition, considering its age. The neck is solid, with no breaks or repairs anywhere. The bridge pickup is not original to this guitar, but it is a vintage Guild HB-1. (It had a DiMarzio Super Distortion at the bridge when I bought it.) The replacement HB-1 I got is allegedly from a 1973 Guild, but there\u2019s no way to be sure of the year. Sounds awesome and is fun to play. I think the hardshell case is original, but I could be wrong. Updating with answers to a couple of questions I\u2019ve received: 1). Q: How are the frets? A: The frets are a little low, but this can be subjective. I measured them the best I could with a set of feeler gauges, and they seem to be about .040 in at the 3rd, 7th, and 12th frets. For reference, Fender advertises their shortest fret wire at .042 in. 2). Q: How much does the guitar weigh? A: Using a non-commercial grade food scale (sorry; that\u2019s probably the best I can do), it weighed in at about 6.6 lbs. For comparison, I weighed 3 Strats on the same scale at 7.6 (alder, hardtail), 7.8 (alder, w/tremolo), and 8.6 (ash, w/tremolo).", "ItemID": "292924899823", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T21:05:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-18T21:05:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1973-Guild-S-100-Black-w-hardshell-case-/292924899823", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Milford, New Hampshire", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929248998238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2ODg=/z/n5AAAOSwMKxcQje~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MDQ=/z/pjQAAOSwtpJcQje-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mPIAAOSwgrZcQjfD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6TkAAOSwpptcQjfP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e3oAAOSwZqlcQjfF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~6sAAOSwvytcQjfK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QTEAAOSwcOZcQjfG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p1YAAOSwT5tcQjfM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xwoAAOSwwOBcQjfI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5eEAAOSwfTlcQjfO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wYsAAOSwuA9cQjfB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "03055", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tdoggyblizzo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 62, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 965.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 965.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "w***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1177}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1973 Guild S-100, Black, w/hardshell case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Guild"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1973"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["S-100"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 159, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
