{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hi, you are looking at a truly special build. The idea behind this build was to create the vibes of a really aged \u201cdirty lemon\u201d/orange Burst 59 LesPaul this includes a hand finished \u201cVOS\u201d style application of true \u201cNitro\u201d lacquered finish, together with the perfect aesthetics of a private stock look, playability and shape. The result is a magnificent blend of 2 icons. This guitar was hand built by master luthier \u201cTom Dodson\u201d of Dodson Guitars in Griffin, GA. Tom meticulously worked on this masterpiece for over a year and it turned out to be a true one of a kind work of art. The guitar is made with the highest end of components, the quality of all woods are second to none and it really chimes like a top tier instrument, im speaking from ownership experience of multiple Private stock models, a Modern Eagle 1, top of the line LesPaul cc Reissues etc.. the guitars flame top speaks for itself. All of the parts are original PRS parts bought directly from PRS and the guitar will come with all of the PRS reciepts from factory and as for the plastic covers, the luthier had to hand make those. The pickups are insanely awesome Fralin Pure PAF\u2019s. The strings are GHS 10\u2019s. It has a super comfortable low oval wide neck profile. The wiring system and pots are the PRS McCarty coil tap system bought new from PRS as well. The case is a genuine PRS case. Will come with two different PRS tremolo arms. The guitar has a real mojo to it and that might be because of the perfectionist build quality of a fully handmade instrument, but the way it looks and present itself is truly a sight to behold in person. This is a one of a kind instrument, a truly special and unique one at that, the next owner of this will be a lucky one.
