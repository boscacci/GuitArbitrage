{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 2016 Epiphone 1958 Korina Flying V w/hard shell case. Both are in EXCELLENT, near MINT condition. The case isn\u2019t an Epiphone brand, but is a very high quality case. There is very little in the way of evidence of handling or playing. Some very minor hints of pick scuffs on the pickguard...and I mean VERY little...and that\u2019s it. I purchased the guitar and case brand new, and it has never left my home since. I absolutely love this guitar, and was blown away by the quality the moment I took delivery of it. I swore I\u2019d never sell it, but unfortunately the time has come to thin the stash a bit. You will NOT be disappointed with this Korina V. Do not confuse this authentic reissue with the early version that came out in the late \u201890s (That \u201890s guitar was loosely based on the original, had low grade components and a maple neck). THIS guitar is modeled very closely to the original, including a genuine Korina neck, and very high grade components and electronics. No upgrades required! The guitar plays and sounds awesome. Neck is straight, truss rod and all components adjust and function as they should. ZERO issues, NO repairs, significant blemishes, or damage of any sort. You will NOT be disappointed. .......
