{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "We have for auction today an black Epiphone 1959 ES 335 Dot with repaired headstock. This guitar is in overall excellent condition except for the headstock which was cracked and repaired. The pictures indicate where the crack was and the repair was made on the back of the neck and the front was also cracked. The entire neck was repainted and clear coated. It holds in tune and doesn't appear to be any problems with the repairs. The Truss rod works as it should. The original hardware is of nickel finish which has tarnished. A good polishing would bring that back to a new look. The body is in fantastic shape with a few minor scratches and swirls that's not gone through the finish. Upgrades are the original tuners that have been replaced with Kluson Tulip Tuners, The nut has been replaced with a bone one. The control knobs and switch tip have been changed also. The neck is the 59 styled heavier neck not the 60s slim tapered one. This would make a fantastic guitar for somebody to use as is or to use for parts. This guitar comes with a very good condition hard shell Epiphone case that has a few minor scratches with the owners manual and warranty card. This guitar is being relisted for Auction as to the nonpayment on this guitar from the first winning bidder!!!!!!!!All Sales Final!!! NO REFUNDS NO RETURNS!!
