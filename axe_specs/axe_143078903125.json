{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "IBANEZ DT400 FR DESTROYER 1995 Fire Red MIJ adrian maiden Serial #: F505121 Wow! Check out this mid 90's Ibanez DT400 Destroyer! Fire Red finish. MADE IN JAPAN. 1995 Fujigen manufacture. 3.4kg. Basswood body, 1 piece maple DT neck, jumbo frets, Gibraltar II bridge, Quik Change tailpiece, and IBZ Quantum neck and bridge humbuckers! It is a used instrument and it has been played so it does have a few small marks on it here and there nothing that I found that I would call significant and overall I'd say that it's in nice shape Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the body, headstock, and neck are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic! Big beefy tone and tons of power with the Quantum humbuckers! Plays great! No gigbag. If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Shipping inside of the USA is $55 by USPS Priority Mail which is registered, insured, and trackable.
