{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Purchased and returned...insanely clean! Capitol Guitars is an authorized Jackson dealer. We are fortunate to be the first dealer in line to receive the 2018 Jackson product line. ORDER WITH US TO GET YOUR GUITAR FASTER THAN ORDERING ANY PLACE ELSE! Please contact us with any questions. The Jackson name has always been synonymous with state-ofthe-art guitar technology and playing, leading the way in crafting instruments that exceed the demands of modern players. Boasting Jackson\u2019s trademark high-speed playability and performance with a mid-range price tag, the X Series Soloist\u2122 SL4X guitar is also the only product in the current lineup to offer a triple single-coil pickup route configuration. With a third Duncan Designed\u2122 HR-101 Hot Rails pickup added between the neck and bridge pickup, we\u2019ve unlocked an even wider and more versatile range of tones. Hot wound rails coupled with a powerful ceramic magnet power this musical beast with the aggressive crunch and sustain hard rock and metal styles demand. With single volume and tone controls and a five-way blade switch, players can explore a variety of pickup combinations, while a Floyd Rose\u00ae Special double-locking tremolo (recessed for picking hand comfort) bridge system provides superior string stability, sustain and dynamic tremolo action. Featuring a 25.5\u201d scale length, the SL4X is crafted out of basswood and coupled with a one-piece through-body maple neck with graphite reinforcement and scarf joint, providing stability against the ravages of the road. Wrapped in white binding, its 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius rosewood fingerboard features 24 jumbo frets and dot inlays. Sleekly designed with bold style, the SL4X is available in eye catching Bubblegum Pink, Daphne Blue or Neon Orange finishes with a single-ply white pickguard, black hardware and a traditional Jackson pointed 6-in-line headstock.\u2022 25.5\u201d scale\u2022 Basswood body\u2022 One-piece maple neck through-body with graphitereinforcement and scarf joint\u2022 12\"- 16\" compound radius rosewood fingerboard with 24jumbo frets and dot inlays\u2022 White neck binding\u2022 S/S/S configuration featuring a Duncan Designed\u2122 HR-101BHot Rails bridge pickup, a Duncan Designed HR-101M Hot Railsmiddle pickup and a Duncan Designed HR-101N Hot Rails neckpickup\u2022 Single volume and tone controls, plus five-way blade switch\u2022 Recessed Floyd Rose\u00ae Special double-locking tremolo bridgesystem\u2022 Available in Bubblegum Pink, Daphne Blue or Neon Orangewith a single-ply white pickguard and black hardware\u2022 Jackson pointed 6-in-line headstock Series: X SeriesBody Material: BasswoodBody Finish: GlossNeck: 1-Piece Maple Neck-Through-Body with Graphite Reinforcementand Scarf JointNeck Finish: GlossFingerboard: Rosewood, 12\u201d - 16\u201d Compound Radius (304.8 mm to 406.4 mm)Frets: 24, JumboPosition Inlays: DotNut (Material/Width): Floyd Rose\u00ae Locking, 1.6875\u201d (42.86 mm)Tuning Machines: Jackson\u00ae-Branded Sealed Die-CastScale Length: 25.5\u201d (648 mm)Bridge: Floyd Rose\u00ae Special Double-Locking Tremolo (Recessed)Pickguard: 1-Ply WhitePickups: Duncan Designed\u2122 HR-101B Hot Rails (Bridge)Duncan De-signed\u2122 HR-101M Hot Rails (Middle)Duncan Designed\u2122 HR-101N Hot Rails (Neck)Pickup Switching: 5-Way Blade: Position 1.
