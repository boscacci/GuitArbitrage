{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Appears to be a counterfeit copy of a Carvin guitar; checked electronics and they have strange cyrillic writing on them, so maybe a a Russian/Ukranian copy? Either way, the single coil pickups in it are from the 80's Martin strat copies, and they definitely have some serious bite! Sounds alot like Steely Dan leads. This guitar rips! The bridge humbucker pickup is unknown but serves the purpose. It's really all about the single coil sound with this guitar. Has some surface scratches and a few dings in the black paint, and also a decent amount of scrapes on the maple fretboard that appears to be play wear, but the frets are smooth and shiny and have no buzzes or issues. An interesting one-of-a-kind guitar that actually plays well! Feel free to ask any questions. FREE SHIPPING to the lower 48 states! A hardcase is also available for this guitar for an additional $60, or a soft gig bag for $10--let me know before paying and I'll include it.
