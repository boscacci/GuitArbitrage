{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2002 Made in Korea Epiphone Les Paul Custom Cherry Sunburst Body & Neck Neck Guitar Husk Project. Cherry Sunburst Flame Top. Bound body and neck. Condition - Factory nut is loose and will need to be reset and glued. First few frets show noticeable wear and have divots in them. No dead spots or buzzing in frets while playing on neck. Frets have tons of life left on them. I played on the guitar for several hours before disassembling and had no issues what so ever. Fretboard is in great condition. Light surface scratches on face of headstock finish. No chips or nicks on edges of headstock. 2 minor noticeable scratch marks in finish on back of body, pictured in photos. Minor scratches in surface from normal playwear and handling of guitar. Factory binding is fully intact and shows normal aging from over the years. Guitar had a Bigsby on it when it came into my possession which explains 2 extra screw mounting holes on front of body. No other modifications done to guitar. No cracks or damage around neck joint area that meets body. Guitar husk is in overall great to excellent played condition with the exception of wear listed above. I would give it a solid 8 out of 10 for its condition. No cracks or any damage on guitar. Mainly minor cosmetic wear from normal playwear over the years. Neck is straight. Truss rod is fully intact and works fine with no issues. Husk will be carefully packed and wrapped in a sturdy soft case gig bag and shipped in a strong cardboard guitar box. I have shipped these guitar husks all over the world and they have always arrived safe and undamaged. Guitar is being sold as a project because there are no parts included with guitar.
