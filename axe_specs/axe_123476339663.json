{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your consideration is a 1989 Fender HM Strat electric guitar in a blue finish. This one is an awesome player, with a few signs of use. Headstock looks great with a few minor nicks and dings, nothing too detrimental. Gotoh tuners work wonderfully. One of the backs of the tuners has popped off, as pictured. Frets look good, fretboard definitely shows some signs of use. The body does have some nicks and dings. Two bigger dings, one on the side of the body which is a little chewed up, and one that goes through the finish to the wood. Bridge pickup is a replacement, and the neck pickup is a replacement. Coil tap installed. Missing tremolo cavity cover. The guitar plays well and sounds killer. Comes with hardshell case, also pictured. WE SHIP FAST!
