{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I purchased this instrument with a load of other musical instruments. Both Pickups are working and guitar sounds really good. Photos show a missing tuner grommet, but I have it and it will be included. So many little things need addressed that I am selling the instrument without doing any work on restoration or cleaning. If you have some skills, this will end up being a great player.

Small white switch (Next to three way switch) does not appear to produce a change in sound, Knobs are mixed and matched, finish has some strange lines in it. (Like crazing but very isolated), chrome has some pitting and rust, metal \"Switch\" like thing on the bridge is missing, tremolo arm, spring and thumb screw are missing (and wont be easy to replace). The fretwires have some lines in them (but not deep) also the neck is just a little bit twisted. The result is a slight buzz at third fret for the three high strings. ( I am confident some fret dressing will resolve this, but action will never be super low) The complicated binding is in great shape. NOTE: There is a ground wire from bridge to output jack (See Photo) I am not sure what happens if this is removed.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
