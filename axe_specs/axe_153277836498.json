{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is an absolutely gorgeous PRS SE CUSTOM 22 electric guitar. It is black/grey in color and in beautiful condition. To be completely transparent, this was my first guitar that was gifted to me back in 2006/2007, therefore, it is about 11/12 years old. The only thing that this guitar has ever been used for is practice and for the majority if its life, has been in my closet completely unused. (Which is a shame because it deserves to be used and loved and appreciated.) I have tried to take some simple pictures to showcase exactly what this guitar looks like and the condition it is in. The only thing that could be considered \"damage\" is there are some very slight buckle scratches on the back of the guitar which I took pictures of so there is no confusion as to the condition. I'm not kidding when I say the condition is almost like brand new. I just put brand new strings on her and a PRS gig bag is included in your purchase price. Which is also featured in the pictures. Also, I tried to sell this guitar before and paid the shipping for the buyer and they refused the package before even seeing it. So, I have been forced not to accept returns on this item. Thank you for your time and interest! :)", "ItemID": "153277836498", "EndTime": "2018-11-27T04:16:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-26T03:39:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-SE-Custom-22-CM2VS-Electric-Guitar-/153277836498", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Mobile, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532778364988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x4YAAOSwOWdb-1zt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JRgAAOSwwXRb-1z-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f~0AAOSweX5b-10U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tqMAAOSwQuZb-10Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wmgAAOSwhrpb-2uj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/miUAAOSwwPdb-2un/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YkEAAOSw1T1b-2us/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "36693", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kelsi_98", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 262}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith SE Custom 22 CM2VS Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple", "Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["CM2VS"]}]}, "HitCount": 60, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 355.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78642793", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
