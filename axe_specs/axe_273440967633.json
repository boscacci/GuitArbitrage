{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is this amazing Bill Lawrence (Bill & Becky) Wilde USA Guitar. This is a very early production guitar with a serial number of A0002 and is also Signed by the man himself. There were very few of these guitars made. it has a few dings and dents as pictured and one on the back of the headstock that cant be seen on the face of it. the guitar has been played and there is a reason for that Bill Lawrence and his wife Becky only made about 200 of these guitars for two years...95-97 built in Bethlehem, PA. This is not a (Bill Lawrence USA...totally different company), this was made by Bill Lawrence \"Wilde\" USA. Guitar has a nice round medium \"C/D-sh\" shaped maple neck, and a rosewood fret board, light weight at around 7 pounds, and rings like a bell. Bill and his team made the bodies, necks, custom Noisefree pu's, cables, etc., in his Pennsylvania factory with CNC, custom designed spray room with curing/drying room plus all the other equipment. Each guitar was hand finished with Bill's special clear coat varnish. These are super high quality guitars that sound as amazing as they look. Frets are in perfect condition. Single coil L280 \"Wilde\" pu in the neck and middle, and a \"Wilde\" L450 humbucker in the bridge with a switch that allows for single coil tones from the bridge pu as well. These guitars are as good as the Fender Custom shop Strats if not better! Comes with a tweed Hardshell Case. Any questions please feel free to ask.", "ItemID": "273440967633", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T04:34:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-03T22:42:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1995-Bill-Lawrence-Wilde-usa-Bill-Becky-Guitar-Signed-Bill-Lawrence-/273440967633", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Nazareth, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2734409676338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lX4AAOSwnnlbjbfr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RzIAAOSw1H9bjbfu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yNoAAOSwj~9bjbf1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bfoAAOSw5sBbjbf9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xxsAAOSwQR9bjbgE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4BgAAOSw5-lbjbgL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KMAAAOSwgq9bjbgR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kg0AAOSwvspbjbgX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1jIAAOSwkXlbjbgf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Wr0AAOSwEDtbjbgs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j2kAAOSw4axbjbg7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Tx0AAOSwS9Bbjbia/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "18064", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sixstringbrokerage", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 37, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 126}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1995 Bill Lawrence \"Wilde\" usa (Bill & Becky) Guitar  Signed By Bill Lawrence", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cream"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1995"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Bill Lawrence"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 350, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
