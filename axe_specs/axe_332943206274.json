{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "(NO RESERVE ON THIS SEAFOAM SQUIER BULLET) THIS IS A PROJECT GUITAR, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT NEED FIXED TO BE A COOL GUITAR. I lost my patience as every time I start working on it, something goes wrong. I do think it\u2019s me that\u2019s the problem. I need to have more patience. Back to the guitar, I wanted to put a Floyd Special on this Strat, and succeeded after trying a Wilkinson which had junk parts. This is my very first try at a project like this, so this is why it\u2019s still a project. There are just some screw ups to fix in which (I pointed to in the photos). The one with the trem itself is where I over tightened the ALLEN BOLT TO HOLD THE G STRING AT THE TREMELO. The bolt is fine, THE SADDLE THAT THE BOLT GOES INTO IS STRIPPED. The next would be the (AT THE PLATE SCREW THAT IS BROKEN OFF TO SCREW THE NECK TO THE BODY). Then the final flaw is THE NUT . I HAD A GUY THAT IS A GOOD WOODWORKER CARVE OUT THE SPOT FOR THE LOCK NUT, AND HE CARVED THE WRONG SPOT, Which I should\u2019ve been more specific. My Bad. The routing on the body isn\u2019t terrible, but it\u2019s different. I did put GOLD LOCKING TUNERS FROM STRATOSPHERE on it. There are some back plate screws missing. The case was just a $60 case AND GOES WITH IT. Once again, this is a novice attempt, but the guitar can still be saved with skill, parts, and maybe some more money if a new trem is needed. I would be happy to answer any questions, and I\u2019m not looking to make a lot of money on this , but to help with my losses (case, parts, stress lol)", "ItemID": "332943206274", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T21:54:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-11T21:54:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/squier-bullet-stratocaster-/332943206274", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tyrone, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329432062748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aIYAAOSwb8BcECkS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hvoAAOSw4vpcECja/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KGYAAOSw7wFcECkI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zmwAAOSwF5hcECjK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JigAAOSwlelcECjr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DNcAAOSwzCtcECj9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LG0AAOSw1jpcECj0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/T70AAOSwbKdcECkx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vIIAAOSwjMtcECkg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "16686", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "radr19731", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 241, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 22, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 149}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "squier bullet stratocaster", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}]}, "HitCount": 327, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 105.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
