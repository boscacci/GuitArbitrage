{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Dead mint ( minus some light scratches on the pick guard that show when tilted into the right light ) Charvel Custom Jake E Lee Signature guitar. Gorgeous white metallic that changes colors in different lights. The guitar was collector owned and lightly played a handful of times. Includes sweet looking custom shop case and paperwork. This is a good one... the guitar is very resonant and you feel the vibrations through your arm and belly when chording. I've got several strats and none play and sound this good. ---------------------------For decades now, the most requested Charvel guitar ever is a Jake E Lee signature model based on the distinctive white \"Charvel-ized\" instrument the great guitarist has played ever since he bought it new back in 1975.
