{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "\" VINTAGE AMERICAN KRAMER FOR SALE \" UP FOR BIDS IS A KRAMER VINTAGE 1987 AMERICAN STAGE MASTER STANDARD 1. THIS BAD ASS AXE IS IN THE SUPER RARE CHAMPAGNE PEARL FINISH WITH THE GOLD HARDWARE. HAVE NOT SEEN ANOTHER ONE IN THIS AWESOME FINISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPECIAL ORDER DONT KNOW. I HAVE ASKED MANY SEASON PLAYERS OF 30 PLUS YEARS PLAYING/COLLECTING IF THEY HAVE SEEN ANY IN THIS COLOR THEY ALL SAID NO. I BELIEVE THIS IS THE EARLY FIRST YEAR FOR THIS MODEL AS IT HAS THE STRAIGHT NOT ANGLED ONE HUMBUCKER. THIS AXE IS A ROCK MACHINE BUT HAS HAD A COUPLE MODS TO MAKE IT MORE VERSITLE. THE BILL LAWRENCE HUMBUCKER AND THE TONE KNOB HAVE BEEN ADDED FOR MORE PLAYING ABILITIES.ALSO THE STRAP BUTTON WAS MOVED OVER A BIT ON THE TOP HORN I GOT IT THIS WAY.THIS GUITAR IS EQUIPPED WITH A NICE DARK EBONY FRETBOARD THAT IS BOUNDED AND HAS AWESOME HEAD STOCK PEARL INLAYS. ALSO HAS A GOLD LOCKING NUT AND A GOLD \"REAL\" FLOYD ROSE TREM FOR MASSIVE DIVE BOMBS. IT HAS THE ORIGINAL GOLD TREM ARM AS MOST ARE LOST. THEN TOPPED OFF WITH A SET OF GOLD SCHALLER TUNERS TO KEEP IT IN TUNE. WHAT AND AWESOME HIGH QUALITY GUITAR!!!! THIS AXE IS SUPER CLEAN AND HAS BEEN STORED AWAY UNPLAYED FOR YEARS IN ITS CASE. ITS IN REAL NICE CONDITION SHOWING ONLY NORMAL LITE WEAR A REAL JEM FOR BEING 32 YEARS OLD.IT HAS A FEW DINGS,MARKS,LITE SCRATCHES AND THE GOLD HARDWARE HAS OXIDIZED SOME BUT THE GUITAR IS BEAUTIFUL. I HAD MY PRO GUITAR TECH GO THROUGH IT AND CLEAN IT AND SET IT UP PROFESSIONLLY AT A COST OF $65. THE ACTION IS SUPER LOW AND IT SMOKES WHAT A GUITAR. A BRAND NEW SET OF ELIXIR 10'S THE BEST STRINGS OUT THERE ARE INSTALLED. A BIG BONUS IS THAT IT HAS ITS ORIGINAL VINTAGE KRAMER HARD SHELL CASE. THESE ARE HARD TO FIND AND BEING BOUGHT UP BY COLLECTORS. SOME LUCKY BIDDER WILL BE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS AND WILL TREASURE IT. GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!!!
