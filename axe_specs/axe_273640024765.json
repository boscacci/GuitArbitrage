{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar started as a Squire Stratocaster\u00a0and was transformed into this version of \"Blackie\". The body and neck are Squire, the tuning keys are original; everything else has been upgraded. The pickups are \"Guitar Madness Premium Alnico cream-colored Single Coil Set\", the wiring kit is from \"The Art of Tone\" with CTS pots. The pickguard and back plate are aged-white and the pickup covers and knobs are cream.The 5-position switch is missing the cream-colored tip (it was not included with the wiring kit - they only cost a couple dollars). The bridge/tremolo and jack plate are from Q-Parts' aged collection - they look great! Finally, a '70's headstock logo is [for appearance only]. The relic job on the body [I believe] is quite stunning. I didn't just sand off some paint in a few spots; it was sanded most of the way down, given a lot of strategic nicks and dings; it was given three coats of flat black. Many hours of sanding, scraping, filing, and \"artificial aging\" was then applied through various methods; then the whole thing was given 3 coats of satin acrylic clear and the clear coat was aged and dulled with 00 Steel wool. This guitar is not just a custom relic, it actually looks \"Road-worn\". Very sweet!", "ItemID": "273640024765", "EndTime": "2019-01-17T04:05:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T21:17:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-Black-Strat-Relic-looks-amazing-plays-like-butter-many-upgrades-/273640024765", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Wentzville, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736400247658080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/ajUAAOSwrpJcJByH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NzY=/z/07MAAOSwGBRcJByK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CAgAAOSw1rpcJBye/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8HwAAOSwMg5cJByQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/790AAOSwgb1cJByM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9S0AAOSwV3dcJByV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MU4AAOSwT5tcJByT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rrYAAOSwzd9cJByY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/up4AAOSwFZZcJByb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "63385", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "revpetit01", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 46, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 262}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom Black Strat Relic - looks amazing, plays like butter, many upgrades", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}]}, "HitCount": 208, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
