{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I respectfully request that you read the entire item description prior to bidding and/or asking questions. This auction is for a 2000 Fender USA American Telecaster Electric Guitar (SN Z0036063 - Made in USA) that is in very nice overall used condition in the factory hard case as shown.Sorry, no documentation or other accessories. All that is included in the auction is the guitar and case shown in the pictures. I need to tell you that I do not play the guitar, but I have sold very many guitars on eBay over the last 16 years including numerous Fenders, Gibsons, Martins, and Taylors. There are several scratches on the the body from normal use. They are hard to see since the body is gloss black. There is a small spot of wear through the finish on the edge of the body. Otherwise, the guitar is in excellent condition throughout (see pictures). There is minimal fret wear. I very carefully loosened the strings and removed the neck from the body so I could provide pictures of the manufacture markings on the body and neck (see pictures). I also provided a picture of the controls (see pictures). The guitar weighs slightly under 8 pounds. One of the hinges on the back of the case partially pulled out from the plastic, but it has been epoxy glued and seems to hold just fine. The case latches properly. There are also some scrapes on the top of the case from removed stickers. Please review the pictures as they describe the guitar much better than words. I will guarantee the guitar to be as described or your money back including shipping both ways. I have started the bidding at $0.99 with no reserve. Therefore, the highest bidder wins the auction. S,H,&I is $44.95 via standard ground shipping within the continental (lower 48) United States. This price will include proper and careful packaging in a new premium box made for shipping guitars.
