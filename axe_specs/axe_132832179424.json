{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "On offer is an all-original 1966 Fender Musicmaster II electric guitar in Daphne Blue complete with the original hard shell case. Musicmaster II guitars have the longer and more useful 24\" scale, the same as Fender Mustangs. The cosmetic condition is very good to excellent. There are a few dings in the body that do not go through the finish, and the lacquer on the back has started to check a bit. The neck has a small wear spot on the bottom side (see photo), and the head stock is starting to check on the back. Decal is in good shape with some wear. Other than that, the guitar is in great shape for a vintage guitar it's age. The neck and fret board show very little playing wear. Hardware is overall in great cosmetic and working condition. Electronics work well with no issues. While this paint color is notorious for turning green with age, this guitar's finish has mostly kept to its factory blue color. There is little noticeable playing wear and tear as well as being in very good to excellent overall condition. This guitar has great tone and is very playable. The action is set medium low and the shallow 'C'-shaped neck feels great in the hand. There is just something magical about a factory-stock 60's Fender! The original hard-shell case in very good condition is included. It has some minor dings and the covering fabric has a couple wear spots. One latch has lost its spring but still closes securely. Interior is in good shape. This is a no reserve auction for the guitar and original case. Successful bidder will pay via paypal or else contact me concerning payment with in 48 hours of auction close. The guitar will be securely packed and shipped via UPS ground/insured and shipped within two business days of cleared payment. Guitar and case are sold as-is and used. USA bidders only please. Please feel free to ask any questions you have concerning this auction. I also have a 1967 Fender Bassman amp head up for auction at this time.
