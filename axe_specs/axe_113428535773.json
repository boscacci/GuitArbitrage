{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Greetings from Jim Wright Guitars. I design and assemble original-design electric guitars for working musicians featuring American and imported components, hand-finished and assembled in the USA. This is basically a self-sustaining hobby, based on over 30 years experience as a music store and freelance instrument tech. I worked up this \"guitfiddle\" design two years ago, and have constructed several for my own use and for sale. Since I have actually put some of these to use and shown others around, I will list them as \"used\"; they are mostly demos and proof-of-concept constructions. All are highly playable, good-sounding instruments. Here is guitar #1: Body: Solid Alder; tangerine stain; single cutaway, violin cutouts, lower bout top bevel, back tummy cutout. Neck: Slim C-shape Maple, pau ferro board, reverse headstock, medium frets. Hardware: black wraparound bridge (solid brass); black locking machines. Electronics: 2x ceramic p-90 dogear pickups (reverse wound--when neck and middle are on and phase is reversed for either, operates in humbucking mode--sounds FAT), 1x Sentell dogear humbucker w/ Alnico slugs. Wired following \"Red Special\" schematic: lower row of switches are on/off for each pu, middle row are phase reversal for each pu, top row is a coil-cut for the bridge pu, and a 'sweet switch' tone switch wired to a capacitor, w/ volume knob. Produces quite a range of useful tones for rock, blues, roots, etc. I will include an additional matched pair of P90s (also reverse-wound), in case you want to experiment w/ different configurations, different tone combinations. Overall condition: As used--some minor scratches and dings in the finish. Instruments are carefully packed and shipped via USPS, insured for sale price. Sorry, no cases or gigbags are included, but these fit standard rectangular cases meant to fit Strats, etc.", "ItemID": "113428535773", "EndTime": "2018-12-13T17:49:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-06T17:49:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Original-design-Solidbody-electric-violin-style-orange-P90s-/113428535773", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Dixon, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134285357738080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/8HcAAOSwHjtb~YTh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/jXkAAOSwORxb~YSL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/ygAAAOSwGYhb~YSa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/7QQAAOSwiwZb~YSt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/n1QAAOSw3LVb~YTC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/AOMAAOSw~xtb~YTL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/088AAOSwF1tb~YTV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/JTEAAOSwBJVb~YTr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/A3AAAOSwsqdb~YTz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "61021", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wrightj2p3g", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1169, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 508}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Original design Solidbody electric, violin style, orange, P90's", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jim Wright Guitars"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["\"Guitfiddle\""]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 14, "Subtitle": "Jim Wright Guitars original \"guitfiddle\" electric", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 304.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Some signs of play/wear; possible finish flaw/defect; no major damage or faults.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
