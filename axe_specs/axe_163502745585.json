The SOB avenge features rosewood fingerboad, red-edged Beast style headstock, a single high-output humbucker pickup with a single volume, bolt-on neck, and black hardware, not to mention its eye-catching blood red bevels and beast wing inlay.Basswood Body With Beveled TopBasswood provides a warmer tone than maple and other hardwoods, along with great low-end response, and is overall a lightweight wood. Perfect for non-traditional body shapes, and the Avenge SOB certainly fits the bill.Beveled TopMost of B.C. Rich's body styles employ a beveled edge around the shape, including this one. In many ways bevels on a top are similar to facets on a cut stone. They catch the light and reflect at different angles, giving the instrument more of a three dimensional look. Some of the B.C. Rich top bevels are extreme and wide while others are subtle and narrow. Occasionally the shape of the instrument is accented by painting the bevels a contrasting color.The Avenge SOB gets a red bevel to match its red inlays. It all looks wicked against the gloss onyx finish.Bolt-on ConstructionA number of B.C. Rich guitars use a classic Bolt-on construction. On these instruments a neck (typically maple) is bolted on with 4 screws to the body. This construction offers some added flexibility in the instruments adjustment and provides the option to change the neck in the future.The Avenge SOB features a maple neck with an ultra-playable natural satin finish, and a 24-fret rosewood fingerboard. That's where you'll find one of this axe's most visually striking features, the red \"beast wing\" inlays. The deep cutaways make access to higher notes a breeze, so you can shred away in that upper register without any problems.B.C. Rich BDSM PickupThe Avenge SOB takes a no-frills approach when it comes to pickups, with just a single BDSM humbucker in the bridge position. Really, what more do you need? B.C. Rich designed their BDSM humbucking pickups to provide a solid sound and to be durable while delivering high output. BDSM stands for Broad Dynamic Sonically Matched. Which simply means that the pickup is designed to reproduce a wide range of frequencies accurately (broad dynamic). Then they are tested and matched in pairs (Neck and Bridge) by their inherent individual and signature tonal and output characteristics to give a solidly balanced tone (sonically matched).HardwareThe Avenge SOB features a Tune-o-Matic bridge with string-thru-body design, for serious sustain and solid tuning. The chrome die-cast tuners seal the deal, and, like the other hardware, feature a black finish.", "ItemID": "163502745585", "EndTime": "2019-01-27T19:30:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T15:42:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/B-C-Rich-Avenge-SOB-Electric-Guitar-Extreme-Coffin-Case-/163502745585", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Muskegon, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635027455858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwOVgxMTMy/z/0n4AAOSwH3Zbc5ie/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUxMFgxMTMz/z/0HQAAOSwBmNbc5iU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUxMFgxMTMz/z/YYsAAOSwF91bc5iH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUxMFgxMTMz/z/jsoAAOSwDY5bc5iq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwOVgxMTMy/z/rc0AAOSwCH9bc5i1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI1/z/kHkAAOSw~RRbc5jC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ5OFgxMTI1/z/WvEAAOSw3uRbc5jN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ5OFgxMTI1/z/zU8AAOSwDtRbc5jW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ5OFgxMTI1/z/JuwAAOSw4gpbc5je/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExNFgxNTA0/z/g-gAAOSwdi5bc5lC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "49442", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "runaway01", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1016, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "B.C.
