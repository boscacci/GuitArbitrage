{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a\u00a0barely used vintage white EVH Wolfgang Special guitar body made in Japan in 2010 - the serial number for the body is WG103501J (as pictured). This is a flat-top basswood body with black binding, and comes complete with the stock EVH Wolfgang zebra humbuckers. The pickups, 3-way switch, volume and tone controls, and output jack are all stock and in perfect working condition. Also included are the Floyd tremolo pivot post screws and the after-market black Schaller straplock buttons. The\u00a0stock trem cavity cover and screws, as well as the black neck screws and ferrules (all pictured) are also included. The body and all hardware are literally in like-new\u00a0condition - cosmetic and functionality. No dings, scratches, rust, or chips anywhere that I can see. You just have to add a Floyd and a neck and it's ready to go. Lastly, I have the original sales hang tag with serial number and the original chrome strap buttons (both not pictured).\u2028 All sales final. PayPal only.
