{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Sad story here. I bought this on Ebay 15+ years ago as a guitar for my studio. Three years ago I was getting a routine set up done and my luthier called me to say I need to come to his shop immediately. Was I surprised when he took off the pick guard to show me the guitar had been altered to put another pickup in it at some point, as well as possibly been resprayed over the original finish? In addition, today I decided to look at the neck to discover its a 72. Long story short, I was taken. As I do not want to pull one over on a fellow ebayer, what you see is what you get. All good parts, but not the collector's item I thought it was! I am selling a few items from what's left of my collection/studio gear. You know what you are getting with this one!", "ItemID": "192703800526", "EndTime": "2018-11-03T20:05:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-27T20:05:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1969-Fender-Tele-Custom-/192703800526", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Andover, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927038005268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/As4AAOSwHnJb1MJC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/B7cAAOSww7tb1MJE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IrsAAOSwcWtb1MJP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NPMAAOSwdmlb1MJZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwM1g5MjY=/z/7~YAAOSwE1xb1MKQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU0NVg5NjQ=/z/4QsAAOSw6M9b1MKf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XrsAAOSwhnlb1MJs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/l-MAAOSwEX5b1MJs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/C3kAAOSwXOhb1MJr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PZsAAOSwBgpb1MJs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01810", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ockest", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 110, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3338.88, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3338.88, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5310}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1969 Fender Tele Custom", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Thinline"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["1969/70"]}]}, "HitCount": 204, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 3388.88, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
