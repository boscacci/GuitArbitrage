{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar is in excellent condition given its age. There is a pin sized ding on the top of this guitar. Some fret wear on a couple of top frets. Thanks for looking!! NOTE: Comes with its original case with the adjustment tools. Also, included is a pair of Schaller strap locks. This guitar has the micro-tilt feature. There is a hole in the neck plate to tilt the neck back and forth to improve the action and playability. This guitar is set up to my personal specifications as I play with my fingers. Therefore, it is strung with extra light strings and the action was professionally set up to be extra low with minor buzzing. This is how I like it. You might want to change it if you purchase this guitar. Thanks NOTE: NO TREMOLO BAR. The Lone Star Stratocaster was an American Standard Stratocaster with an upgraded electronics package that included a Seymour Duncan Pearly Gates humbucker at the bride and two Texas Special single coil pickups. They were available in a light Sunburst or Olympic White with a tortoise shell pickguard, and Black, Candy Apple Red, Shoreline Gold or Teal Green Metallic with a white pearloid guard. These guitars were only available with tremolo (no hardtails) and sealed chrome tuners. Necks had maple or rosewood fretboards with 22 frets pressed into them.", "ItemID": "223303389103", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T16:19:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-29T19:59:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/American-Fender-Lonestar-Stratocaster-Guitar-1999-Candy-Apple-RED-EXC-/223303389103", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Racine, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233033891038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0xQAAOSwMOtcDTBO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3dgAAOSw~VBcDTBS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wBkAAOSwdhdcDTBV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lcQAAOSwG49cDTBX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Pf8AAOSwAzxcDTBZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cB4AAOSwHOZcDTBc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X4oAAOSwdxVcDTBe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lZwAAOSwdwVcDTBg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ncYAAOSwsDZcDTBj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Eq4AAOSwVcZcDTBm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mdoAAOSwsrlcDTBq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HocAAOSwPXFcDTBt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53402", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dorseyantiques2012", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1278, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 675.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 675.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "American Fender Lonestar Stratocaster Guitar 1999 Candy Apple RED (EXC.)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Lonestar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Lone Star Strat"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["seymour duncan pickup"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 99, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=165608785", "StoreName": "1280Vintage"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
