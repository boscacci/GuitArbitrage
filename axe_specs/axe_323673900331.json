{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Epiphone by Gibson X1000 - X-1000 Super Strat Electric Guitar Vintage 1980s (Used) Working Perfectly Frets are nice and haven't seen much use, I think it was sitting unused in the case for many years due to A broken tremolo. (Which is now fixed - See below) Plays great. This guitar is an amazing guitar and stands up against any of the super strats (Kramer, Charvel etc.....) from the 80s with the few performance modifications that have been done. (See mod desription below) Dates of manufacture of this model: 1986 to 1989 Made in Korea X1000 - X-1000 has a offset double cutaway body with a maple through body neck 25.5 in. scale. The 24 fret bound fretboard is ebanol with chevron inlays. The explorer style headstock is also bound with 6 inline tuners. Great feeling neck. Metal flake white paint which has aged/golden very nicely. Gorgeous Black hardware 2 single coil pickups and 2 humbucking pickup with single volume control. Each pickup has its own mini-switch for unusual pickup combinations. Bridge is a Steinberger KB Tremolo (Steinberger KB trem on this model from 1988 to 1989). OK, so here's what has been done to fix/improve this guitar: The pickups are new Custom Alan Entwistle Neodimium Magnet pickups. A HDN Humbucker in the bridge (Bridge: 16.9K), XS62N-N Neck (7.5K) , and XS62N-M Middle (7.5K). Black Great sounding pickups, check out the reviews. I'd put them up against most any Duncan's or EMGs. All switches, wiring and electronics are new. The tuners have been replaced with Carvin Kiesel 6 Inline Locking Guitar Tuners Black from a 2015 Carvin DC127 electric guitar, Ultra-fine 19:1 gear ratio. The locking nut has been removed as it is unecessary. The locking tuners keep it in tune even under extreme whammy action. The bridge on this guitar is a Steinberger KB Tremolo. This tremolo was originally produced using some weak parts. (These trems all have broken.) I ordered new heavy duty precission parts from a company in Germany and rebuilt this trem into a very sturdy and amazing tremolo. Replaced week asian Posts/Pedestals with hardened german steal ones. (see photos) Replaced internel Spring Tension Adjuster with hardened a german steal one. Replaced the old sping with a new superior/stronger geramn steel one. This guitar is rock solid now. A Shred Machine. Photos are of actual item from as many angles as I could get The few disclaimers I have on this guitar are as follows. It's a used/vintage guitar and has dings here and there. but I beleive it's in great condition for it's age. Between the bridge and the Humbucking pickup there are chips missing from where the brinde used to scrape (When it was broken, the bridge is fixed now and doesn't scrape. It works as it should) The plastic control cavity cover was cut out of plastic by the previous owner. I didn't get around to fixing the last 2 things, and they don't affect playing etc...... The tone control is disconnected but still there. (Works when connected) See photos for condition for what's included in the auction Epiphone X1000 Guitar Whammy Bar Original case. (On the outside the case has been around the block, inside it's OK, but still works just fine.)
