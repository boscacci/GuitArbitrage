The only mod I did was a treble bleed circuit on eachvolume pot, keeps tone clear as you lower the volume. and I put black speed knobs on and will throwin the original 4 knobs. Some pictures I took with the pickguard off and truss rod cover off, it is includedwith the guitar. I am also throwing in a hardshell case, just bought it recently. this insures safer shipment.Now the guitar has real Abalone fretboard markers on a Ebony fretboard.This is the slim neck profile model.It is great for smaller hands, not like a 50's les paul.
