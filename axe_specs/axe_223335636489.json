{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Very nice Classic Vibe Stratocaster. There are a few scratches and scuffs on the back and edges, but the front looks great, other than a little pickswirl on the pick guard. Upgrades include all gold hardware, frets leveled, crowned and polished, USA Fender Roller String Tree, USA Fender \"F\" neck plate. US Electronics include Oak-Grigsby 5 way switch, CTS 250K pots, Sprague Orange DropTreble Bleed Circuit (prevents loss of treble when rolling off the volume), Sprague Orange Drop Capacitor, Gavitt pushback cloth wiring, USToneworks bridge pickup. Middle pickup tone control also controls bridge pickup, a nice touch featured on US Strats. Action is low and fast, no buzz, plays like butta! Neck and middle pickups are stock Alnico Vs and sound killer, the stock bridge pickup was replaced with a hotter USToneworks VN60. Nice and vintage sounding with some extra growl. Super clean and tight soldering work, check the photo. All electronics function flawlessly. Fender and Custom shop logos added for fun and authenticity, they've been cleared and sealed, and look great! This Strat looks, sounds and plays as good as any MIM Strat out there, if not better. Check my feedback as a seller, players love my guitars! Will include a gig bag(not shown). I pack very securely and ship FAST, so buy with confidence!", "ItemID": "223335636489", "EndTime": "2019-01-30T03:04:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T21:06:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-Classic-Vibe-Stratocaster-w-upgrades-US-Electronics-Very-Good-/223335636489", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "La Salle, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233356364898080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/6rsAAOSwCGVcRNZ3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/npsAAOSw~xtcRNaG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Z4EAAOSwfMlcRNaX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/FtEAAOSwhu9cRNam/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/JIAAAOSwuwlcRNa5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/27oAAOSw6CRcRNbZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4nYAAOSw66JcRNb3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Qu0AAOSwJaxcRNcI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/8u8AAOSwIkNcROKM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80645", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nomolarjoe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 670, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 112}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender/Squier Classic Vibe Stratocaster w/upgrades US Electronics Very Good!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["60s Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["3 tone-Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["885978884308"]}]}, "HitCount": 188, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
