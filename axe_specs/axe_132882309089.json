Seymour Duncan, I believe JB in the bridge, Alnico II in the neck, and Seymour Duncan single in the middle, can't remember the model. Sperzel locking tuners. Comes with a Brian Moore hardshell case. ***********************************************************************************************************Issues: - The tone knob can fall out. Seems to be broken from whatever is holding it to the system. It's not a normal pot. It still works, and there may be an easy fix, or at least easy way to rig it to not fall out inadvertently. - Hardware is tarnishing as seen in the pictures. It doesn't look bad from a few feet away, but it's not shiny and new by any means, so if that bothers you please don't bid or buy it now. ************************************************************************************************************ This guitar would make for an awesome Christmas surprise.
