{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar was purchased brand new in its model year, 2014, by my husband. Sadly, he passed not very long after the purchase. It has less than 75 hours of playing time. It is in excellent condition and it is time it found a good home and a talented musician. I have included the following items along with the purchase of the guitar: Gibson hard case, Ditto Looper, strap and strap lock system and locking guitar stand. There were no modifications made to this guitar at all. It is in its original condition. I don't know all that much about it technically, but I know that it's a beautiful instrument in pristine condition with an incredible sound. I have added pictures (the last two), that depict its authenticity. The serial number on the back of the headstock is difficult to make out, simply because it's such dark, shiny wood and it was imprinted in black. But if you look closely enough, you will see the matching numbers as well as its creation year of 2014, Made in USA. *****PLEASE DON'T ASK ME TO SHIP OUT OF THE US. I DO NOT SHIP INTERNATIONALLY.
