{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "In great shape. Plays and sound fantastic! New strings and setup. Very lightly played with little wear on freshly polished frets. One small scratch on the bottom back that is too small to photograph. Otherwise in excellent conditionIncludes gigbag, tremolo arm, pearloid pickguard and custom trussrod cover (original pickguard and truss rod cover included).The S2 Standard 24\u2019s solid mahogany body and set mahogany neck give this guitar a distinctive resonance and powerful sustain. And when mahogany\u2019s rich, round, warm tone meets the 85/15 \"S\" pickups, there are plenty of clear highs and strong mids to be dialed in. With its solid build and electronics platform, the S2 Standard 24 is a true player\u2019s guitar that handles as well and sounds as good whether it\u2019s plugged straight into your amp or running through your pedal board.The original PRS Standard, introduced in 1987, evolved from Paul Smith\u2019s Pre-Factory all-mahogany guitars. Reimagined here for the S2 Series, the Standard 24 is gig-ready with a pricetag to match. The subtle aesthetic of mahogany and vintage vibe of pickguard-mounted electronics give the S2 Standard 24 an understated look for players who prefer a stripped-down approach to their music.BODY Body WoodMahogany NECK Number of Frets24Scale Length25\"Neck WoodMahoganyNeck ShapePattern RegularNeck Depth At The Nut27/32\u201dWidth of Fretboard at the Body2 1/4\u201dWidth of Fretboard at the Nut1 21/32\u201dFretboard WoodRosewoodFretboard InlayDots HARDWARE BridgePRS Patented Tremolo, MoldedTunersPRS Low Mass LockingHardware TypeNickel ELECTRONICS Treble Pickup85/15 \"S\"Bass Pickup85/15 \"S\" ControlsVolume and Push-Pull Tone Control with 3-Way Blade Pickup Selector", "ItemID": "223314145263", "EndTime": "2019-02-04T04:42:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T17:56:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-PRS-S2-Standard-24-Dot-Inlay-Ice-Blue-Fire-Mist-2017-/223314145263", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lacey, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233141452638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-moAAOSwMKFcMj5D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3soAAOSwN3NcMj5C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wwAAAOSwliFcMj5E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0C4AAOSwHexcMj5E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/chEAAOSwUm5cMj5D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wVgAAOSw6hNcMj5D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t7oAAOSwzqtcMj5E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98503", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "svelosmith", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 819, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 629.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 629.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 94}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith PRS S2 Standard 24 with Dot Inlay Ice Blue Fire Mist 2017", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["s2"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Perloid Pickguard &amp; Customer Trussrod Cover"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Purple"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 156, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
