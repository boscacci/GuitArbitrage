{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1960 Hofner Senator Blonde Natural Electric Guitar 4.4lbs w/ OHSC CaseBeautiful 1960 Senator in a lovely blonde finish. Beautiful German goodness in exceptional condition. We have acquired this, along with a few other Hofners, from a guy who looked after all his guitars with great pride! The original finish has very little crazing, unlike most of this age, and has only a few small blemishes. Just check how nice the flame on the back is! The neck is extremely sturdy and holds true due to a previous neck reset. There also seems to be a small filled hole next to the neck join, as you can see. We cannot see anything that has been changed on this, including the tortoise shell pickguard. The original hard case is in brilliant condition, but the guitar sits slightly shy on each side. We'll make sure to fill it out for shipping.Weight: 4.4lbsSerial: 9368Please have a close look at the high resolution photographs below, as these form part of our description.Please note, for all you musicians and collectors outside of Europe, this guitar will need a CITES certificate to accompany the export of this guitar, due to inclusion of the restricted rosewood material.
