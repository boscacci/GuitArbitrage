{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You are looking at a 1994 PRS CE-24 with an Emerald Green finish on a very cool maple flamed top and nickel hardware. This is what is commonly referred to as a \u201cpre-factory PRS\u201d, with the smaller neck heel, and a great vintage vibe (\u201cpre-factory\u201d designates a PRS that was made at the original Virginia Ave factory before the move to the present Stevensville location, making this a very desirable guitar in the eyes of many PRS aficionados). This is really a great guitar, I HATE to sell it but need cash. It sounds and plays great with a very fast wide-thin neck (not at all baseball-bat like). To make a good guitar great, quite a few upgrades and maintenance steps were made by the PRS PRTC for me after I bought this in 2015:Fret level crown New volume pot with treble bleed Tuner upgrade/convert to phase II locking 5-way switch replacement Set tremolo bridge to original specs Complete set-up (intonation, low, buzz-free action, etc.) Add Duncan strap locks Only played lightly in my smoke-free home since. The action is fast & smooth, and it sounds like a great PRS should! This has also been signed by Paul Reed Smith himself on the back plate\u2026 so there\u2019s a nice added bonus for the proud new owner (I keep that plate separate so as not to ruin the signature, so you get 2 back plates)! Features:Model: CE-24 Color: Emerald Green Maple Flamed Top Alder Body Maple Bolt-on Neck Wide/Thin Neck profile Vintage Small Neck Heel Rosewood Fretboard Nickel Hardware 25\" Scale Length Pickups: PRS HFS (Bridge) & Vintage (Neck) Humbuckers ~ Uncovered 1 Volume, 1 Tone and 5-way Rotary Knob Pickup Selector PRS Tremolo Bridge ~ Includes the tremolo bar PRS Phase II Locking Tuners Weighs 8.6 lbs Serial # 4710209 Built on October 14th, 1994 (stamped inside the pickup cavity) and has been played but not abused. There are a few light tiny nicks and scratches from being played during the past 24 years, but nothing major. Some wear on the neck back as shown in the pics. Neck has a really nice, \u201clived in\u201d feel.Also included is the original PRS hard shell case (good shape), tremolo arm, as well as the original Phase I locking tuner guts and volume pot as shown in the pictures. Please feel free to ask any questions, I will answer promptly. Additional pictures available on request.See my feedback, I represent my items accurately and ship very promptly.
