{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is an original black, USA-built Steinberger GL2T, now available from HeadlessUSA. A gorgeous guitar in superb, near-mint condition. This guitar was just restored and set-up by Jeff Babicz, who was the former head of production at Steinberger Sound in Newburgh, N.Y. Jeff refretted the neck, mirror-polished the frets, and serviced the electronics. Jeff rebuilt the original TransTrem with new bearings and spring and also burnished the roller saddles, so it now transposes correctly and returns to zero accurately. This neck-thru-body model features carbon-graphite construction and is impervious to changes in temperature and humidity. Now that this guitar has been through the full restoration process, it will look, play and perform as well as (if not better than) the day that it first left the factory. This Steinberger GL2T guitar will ship in its original Steinberger black gig-bag with its Trans-Trem arm, a new black cotton strap, an extra set of strings, and a copy of Jeff's work-order. Hard cases are available. Purchasing your Steinberger from a trusted source is critical when dealing with these sophisticated instruments. Shipping is $85 within the lower 48 USA states. Rates to Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico will vary. If you have any questions, please e-mail us before ordering. Review our flawless feedback and order with confidence.
