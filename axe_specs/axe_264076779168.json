{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Kay \u2018TrueTone\u2019 Speed Demon K573 guitar takes us back \u2013 a 1962 3-pickup thinline archtop, otherwise known as the K573 and sold through Western Auto mail order catalogs. During the 1950s and into the 1960\u2019s, the Kay company of Chicago was one of the largest musical instrument makers in the USA, which also meant in the world. Supplying guitars under a host of names to anyone who was interested, Kay products were sold in retail stores and mail order catalogs. Western Auto was one of the companies that Kay partnered with, and their instruments bore the \u2018TrueTone\u2019 name. Kay instruments were used by professionals. There was a Barney Kessel model, and many prominent blues artists, including Hubert Sumlin of Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s band used them. The Kay bass was one of the first popular electric basses, once Leo Fender introduced the concept. Beyond the TrueTone name, this is a Kay K537 model, with an arched top and back body made of laminated Maple, a bolt on Maple neck with bound Rosewood fingerboard and brass frets, floating Rosewood bridge, trapeze tailpiece, and Kluson Deluxe single-line tuners. The original pickguard is intact and included. For electronics, three Kay \u2018Speed Bump\u2019 pickups were mounted, each with volume and tone controls. A four position, rotary type switch is mounted on the upper bout. The original nitrocellulose lacquer sunburst finish is in good original shape with little use or wear over the years. In very nice original condition and has a great look and shine! Guitar plays and functions as should and has a great retro sound! A video of it being played can be sent upon request. Includes the original guitar case as well. Thank you!", "ItemID": "264076779168", "EndTime": "2018-12-14T00:28:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T00:28:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1962-Kay-TrueTone-Speed-Demon-Electric-Guitar-Includes-Original-Case-/264076779168", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bristol, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640767791688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kv4AAOSwHGxcCbqB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZHUAAOSw76lcCbp6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kU8AAOSwIAJcCbp5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/olUAAOSw5UFcCbqE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NokAAOSwzZNcCbqF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dP8AAOSwFURcCbp~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K60AAOSwH2VcCbqJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GssAAOSwJ7RcCbqA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fsoAAOSw5tNcCbqI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/phkAAOSwvcFcCbqG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/t4EAAOSwezRcCbst/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VrcAAOSwliFcCb-Z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06010", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "puresalty", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 266, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1962 Kay TrueTone Speed Demon Electric Guitar!
