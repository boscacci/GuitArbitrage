{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1965 Hofner Senator Type 66 Cherry Sunburst Guitar 4.3lbsType 66 (cutaway) Senator in a lovely rare sunburst finish. Beautiful German goodness in exceptional condition. We have acquired this, along with a few other Hofners, from a guy who looked after all his guitars with great pride! This is in exceptional original condition - you really will struggle to find another better. The original sunburst finish has very little crazing, unlike most of this age, and has only a few small blemishes around the edges. We love what has happened to the back of the neck - the original finish is starting to fide to an orange colour. Beautiful! The neck is extremely sturdy and holds true. We cannot see anything that has been changed on this, including the tortoise shell pickguard.
