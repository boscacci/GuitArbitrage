{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered for sale is a Gretsch 5420t in Fairlane Blue. This guitar was upgraded by the dealer with TV Jones, Brian Setzer pickups, Sperzel locking pickups, upgraded wiring , switches, pots and dice cube knobs. If you don't want to spend the big bucks on a made in Japan Brian Setzer model Gretsch, this is the next best thing. It also comes with the Gretsch hard case. Both guitar and case are in outstanding condition with only a few faint scratches on the pick guard of the guitar. This is the more recent Electromatic model with the pinned bridge, a sleeker head stock with the Electromatic name on the pick guard instead of the head stock. I am the second owner. I purchased it a year ago from the original owner. He was a tele/strat guy and could not adjust to the size and feel of this one, he was a mature gentleman and he never took this one out of the house. The dealer he purchased it from sell them for $1,449. This is one beautiful guitar, Fairlane Blue color, great tone and quality and great vibe. I have owned a number of imported hollow body electrics over the past couple of years and this one exceeds them all in tone and quality. I really never play much anymore, I am to old to become a jazz or rockabilly player so I am offering this for sale. You could easily spend around $1,000. bucks out the door at big box stores for the same model Gretsch with no upgrades and the case. If you buy it this weekend I could ship it out Monday in time for Christmas. Please ask all questions. Thank you for looking and your consideration. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas! No International Shipping, Continental USA Shipping only. I will properly pack in a guitar shipping box and ship UPS Ground for $55.", "ItemID": "173691693260", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T11:50:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T21:14:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gretsch-5420t-Fairlane-blue-TV-Jones-pickupus-upgraded-tuners-and-wiring-/173691693260", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": " Virginia, USA", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736916932608080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5pcAAOSw27lcE9MW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5H4AAOSwUP5cE9Mv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KvMAAOSwbKdcE9NW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3OFgxNjAw/z/iJ0AAOSwNX1cE9Np/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/58AAAOSwjwZcE9Oa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rYEAAOSwqnVcE9O0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rkbrmn", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 49, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 675.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 675.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gretsch 5420t Fairlane blue, TV Jones pickupus, upgraded tuners and wiring", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 81, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Gretsch Electromatic 5420t , upgraded by dealer with TV Jones, Brian Setzer pickups, Sperzel locking tuners and wiring.
