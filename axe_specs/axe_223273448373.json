{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a one of a kind 2011 - 52 reissue Fender Telecaster. This Telecaster has been incredibly modified and this plays unbelievably good you will not find another Telecaster that even comes close, the action is nice and low thanks in part to the bridge that was installed which allows you to fully intonate and lower the action here is a list of ever thing that was done. New Kluson Vintage Style Locking Tuners(black) New Bare Knuckle Pile Driver Pickups (black neck cover) New Kluson black round string guide New Black Bakelite Paisley Custom pickguard New Custom black neck plate(see pics) New Black planet waves Elliptical strap buttons New Kluson black string ferruals New Black Bakelite top hat pickup selector New Black Babicz Full Contact Fully Adjustable Bridge New Black input cup New USA Black control plate New Black barrel knobs New Black Screws Copper shielding under pick guard and cavity Neck Date- Feb 4 2011 Body Date -July 20 2011 To start the Bare Knuckle pickups retain the original Telecaster sound but hotter that was important to me that they still sound like a tele but beefed up. The Babicz bridge was by far the biggest improvement it made the guitar come alive it plays and feels like no other tele I have ever played and the Locking Tuners are a nice upgrade stays in tune very good. The wiring is all original and a new set of 9-46 gauge rotosound strings. Also included is a brand new genuine fender black pickguard and all the case candy. There are two small chips which are show in the picture also a little chipping around the ferrules.I\u2019ve had a lot of Telecasters and this one is by far the best I\u2019ve had from sound and feel this is how a Telecaster should sound and feel. It pains me to even consider selling it but health issues and dr bills are forcing me to sell off stuff. Please feel free to ask any questions, you will not be disappointed. Reasonable offers considered. Read my feedback I pride myself on offering quality products and services. I have over $2,000 dollars invested in this guitar so my loss is your gain.
