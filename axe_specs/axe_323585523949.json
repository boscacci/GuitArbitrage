{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Tokai SG copy in trans-heritage red finish is in nearly new condition. There are only a very few very minor blemishes on the finish and the protective plastic film is still on the hardware and access plates. I believe that it was made in China since the serial number starts with \u201cCH\u201d, but I couldn\u2019t find an internet source to help me unravel the manufacture date. The serial number is clearly visible in the photo of the back of the headstock; maybe somebody can help me out? The guitar is constructed of alder with a mahogany veneer on the top and back of the body. It looks fantastic and plays beautifully. The headstock and fretboard feature nice pearloid inlays. The guitar is very well made. A non-original fitted hard shell case also in nearly new condition is included (see photo). If shipping is less than $40, I will refund the difference. A full refund provided with no questions asked. I will return 100% of bid price + 50% of return shipping after the guitar is returned. Yes, this means the buyer takes a small risk (50% of return shipping) when bidding on this guitar. No partial refunds will be provided.", "ItemID": "323585523949", "EndTime": "2018-12-12T03:15:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T03:15:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Tokai-SG-electric-guitar-/323585523949", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bridgeton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235855239498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwNVgxNjAw/z/8qoAAOSwrQxcCSOM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDkx/z/YqUAAOSwBkBcCSOp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIxNlgxNjAw/z/e3kAAOSwPmVcCSO5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4MlgxNjAw/z/F-8AAOSwmE9cCSPK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2N1gxNjAw/z/nlUAAOSwZBRcCSPX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIyNVgxNjAw/z/l0sAAOSwVcZcCSPl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5NlgxNjAw/z/IgwAAOSwWz5cCSP3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI1OVgxNjAw/z/9zgAAOSwMKFcCSQH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2NlgxNjAw/z/1OMAAOSw6dhcCSQb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08302", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "orton0231", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1141, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 501}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Tokai SG electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Alder and mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Tokai"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Trans-heritage cherry"]}]}, "HitCount": 253, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 227.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
