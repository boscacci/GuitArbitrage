You are looking at a 2018 Fender Strat-Tele Hybrid Parallel Universe Limited Edition. Every year at NAMM (Music Trade Show) Fender comes out with some limited edition outrageous designs that are only available to Fender dealers at the NAMM show. They only build enough for the orders they take so they are a very limited run of guitars that Fender dealers won't see for several months. This is one of those guitars. The Strat-Tele Hybrid combines a Strat and Tele together and blends some of it's best part together. The Hybrid uses the three single coil Strat pickups (in this case they are custom shop '69 Strat single coils), with a Strat Neck, Headstock and Tremolo bridge. The Body is an Ash Tele body with a 2-color sunburst gloss nitrocellulose lacquer finish, but it does have a Strat contoured belly cut for comfort. From The Web: The Strat-Tele hybrid is the ideal instrument for throwing down hot licks in any setting. We dressed up the traditional Tele\u00ae body with professional touches like three Custom Shop \u201969 Aged Strat\u00ae pickups, a Strat synchronized tremolo bridge and elegant silver \u201cspaghetti\u201d Fender logo. It\u2019s business in the front and party in the back with this versatile, intriguing limited-edition guitar. The ash body sports the sleek Comfort Contours of a Strat, making this guitar a joy to play, The ergonomic style extends to the American Professional \u201cDeep C\u201d neck which hosts a 9.5\u201d-radius fingerboard with 22 narrow-tall frets and bone nut. The Strat tremolo bridge rocks, dives and screams as you would expect. In a final elegant aesthetic touch, the Limited Edition neck plate marks this instrument as one-of-a-kind. Versatile, powerful and uniquely Fender, the Strat-Tele Hybrid is one of the best ways to get your hybrid twang on. Includes a hardshell case and Certificate of Authenticity.
