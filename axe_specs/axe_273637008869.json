{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "JACKSON DINKY DK2S WITH SUSTAINIAC PICKUP- ORIGINAL HARDSHELL CASE- NEAR MINT AND NO RESERVE! Up for bids is a used but super clean Jackson DK2S guitar. This model features the Sustainiac pickup system which allows for near infinite sustain effects and interesting harmonic options. From what I have read Jackson no longer offers this model which is a shame since the Sustainiac is such cool addition. This example is in fantastic shape and it comes complete with the original molded plastic Jackson case. The finish is a metallic red-ish purple color that was almost impossible to photograph. I'm including photos taken with and without a flash to hopefully give you an idea of the color, but in real life it looks much better. The color and glossiness of the finish caused lots of glare and reflections. There is one BB size or smaller impression in the finish (no missing paint) and some very light pick type marks in the clear coat but that's about it for wear. The hardware is clean, the neck is straight with fast action, and the frets are in excellent shape. The Sustainiac works great. It has an on/off switch and another switch that selects the harmonic mode, and there is a gain knob to adjust the responsiveness. And the guitar plays and sounds fine with the Sustainiac system turned off of course. I did notice that the volume control has some scratchiness as you turn it. I sprayed some electronic contact cleaner into it and it got a little better but there is still some scratchiness when you adjust the volume so be aware of it when bidding as you might want to have your guitar tech look into. I'm going to offer this one with NO RESERVE so bid to win! Check out the photos, and again be aware that the volume control works but makes some scratchy sounds when being turned. Good luck! U.S. shipping will be $55 (more to Alaska and Hawaii).
