{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a rare 2001 Gibson Pete Townsend Signature SG Special Electric Guitar in really nice original condition.....Fresh pro setup ready to play... Very nice semi-gloss cherry finish on the one piece mahogany body with a black \"Batwing\" pickguard. The guitar has great action with a nice RW fingerboard & frets show no wear...These also have Pete Townshend signature printed on the back of the headstock & the shroud in the case...Case is really nice too... Would be a nice collector piece... The two P-90 pickups have a great vintage tone with good output. The bridge is the compensated wrap around tailpiece style. The guitar is a reissue of Pete's '69 SG Special from \"Live at Leeds\" and \"Woodstock\" concerts. These guitars were made in limited numbers and are becoming quite rare. Some SG fans feel this model is every bit as good if not better than the similar Custom Shop model. This particular guitar is in about as good a condition as you will find. If you are a Pete Townshend or just a SG fan, don't let this one pass you by. Looks, plays and sounds great. Includes the original Gibson hard shell case with Pete's signature stitched to the black cover. Serial Number: 02651611 Weight: 7 lbs. 3 oz.

God Bless, GregI am not a music store just a middle aged guy who loves guitars. I use to play drums and guitar until I broke my neck in a diving accident in 1991.
