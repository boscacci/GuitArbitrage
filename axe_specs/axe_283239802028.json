{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You are bidding on a 1980 Ibanez Artist Electric Guitar, Model AR50BL. With its set-in neck and humbucking pickups, the AR50 is a descendant of the famous Ibanez Artist models of the late 1970s. The AR series features a smaller, redesigned body for lighter weight and comfort- later 80's AR50s were much thicker and had binding. This particular guitar is in Very Good ++ condition and hasn't really been played much in the last couple of years. There are only a few small edge picgs (as shown) that even hint of its age (38 !). We dont know if the pickups are the originals-they look and sound like Ibanez V2's but are marked \"Gotoh\" on the back (Gotoh is a Japanese manufacturer and a supplier to Ibanez). They sound awesome -very 80's ! Lots of vintage growl ! All our guitars are from a vast PRIVATE COLLECTION , not GC wallhangers ! Each and every one of our guitars have been hand selected and is vintage and unique....

Its a great looking head turner and a rare (only made a couple of years) and fantastic sounding guitar ! This is a great example of the quality of the imports at the end of the 70's-the peak of Japanese Lutherie-this budget level Artist may not have the bling of its high end cousins like the AR5000, but its a fine instrument where it counts-nice neck, low action....beautiful craftmanship-all the same massive hardware as the top of the line Artists -a great opportunity to try one of these Gibson killers without breaking the bank......
