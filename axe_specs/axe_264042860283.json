{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Available is a Taylor T3 semi-hollow electric guitar with original hardshell case. It has low, smooth action and plays beautifully. This guitar is versatile with its split-coil capability, and it sounds great. It is also lightweight at only 7.4 pounds. It is in very good/excellent condition with hardly a dent/ding/significant scratch on it... No buckle-rash either on the back of the body. The only visible imperfection on it (though not so easily visible except in the glare) is that the clear finish has an imprint or \"surface rub\" between the bridge-and-tail pieces (see photos). It doesn't really penetrate the black finish. It is the size of the pinky-finger tip. There are no cracks and no lacquer-checking, etc. Black is hard to photograph, but it is a quilt-top. The front of the headstock also shows woodgrain. The back of the neck and the body are solid black (glossy finish). Some of the spots shown in the photos are just dust particles and finger prints on a few spots. This guitar is a clean example for a used instrument. The neck size feels really nice, and the ebony fretboard is also a treat besides the frets being in excellent shape (hardly any wear on them, and no divots either). The strings were recently replaced with Elixir .10-.46 (the same that come from the factory). The case is also clean with hardly any wear marks on it, and no stinky odors inside of it either. This quality, American-made guitar retails new for over $2-grand. Bidding starts at a low $849.00 plus S&H (see delivery details below). Note: The guitar stand shown is not included in the sale.
