{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a Daphne Blue Telecaster with TV Jones Classic pickups, Emerson 3-way switch and pots. Wilkerson 3-saddle bridge, and an All-Parts Fender licensed fat neck, 10\" radius. There is a small screw hole where I attempted to put the string tree, in which I moved closer to the nut, the hole is hard to see as the Fender logo somewhat surrounds it, it is not noticeable unless you are really looking for it. In no way does this affect the playability of this guitar. This guitar sounds amazing and is light. The body is Basswood and is semi-hollowbody. Second and third frets need to be dressed as there is some wear on them. Other than that, this guitar is nice to look at, and even better, plays and sounds great!!", "ItemID": "273546078145", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T17:11:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-06T06:19:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-Partscaster-/273546078145", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Smith, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735460781458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzcxWDE1MTc=/z/5~sAAOSwQ-1b4S7w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjYwWDE1NTY=/z/t4gAAOSwy3Jb4S8B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY3/z/Lx0AAOSw-tlb4K2p/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/LtoAAOSwzhZb4K2t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/KTsAAOSwxFVb4K2v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "72908", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "musicman4123", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 112, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 2}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster Partscaster", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}]}, "HitCount": 1168, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
