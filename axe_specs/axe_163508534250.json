{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Bought this and several tele bodies, to create a project guitar, I was planning on taking the body. I'd read good reviews (there's plenty of info on these out there) and love the look of them. The body is not solid rosewood but 1/4\" rosewood slabs, front and back. I believe the body core to be Basswood, but check around on the net. This thing is clean, and looks like it's only been handled a few times. At this price point, it's a great deal. The only thing that I would do to it, if keeping, would be to maybe do a little file/polish on the fret ends. So, I decided not to keep it for two reasons. First I had a great deal come up on another Tele, so my time and money are going there. Second, this thing is too nice to cannibalize, it deserves a good home. The case shown in the pictures does not come with the guitar, but the Fender gig bag shown in one picture, does. I take great pride in my 100% feedback rating and strive for accurate descriptions and quick, safe shipping. I accept only PayPal payments and usually use USPS with tracking, for shipping. Please ask questions before bidding. If you have no, or negative feedback, lets talk before bidding. I do not accept returns (I've been burned too many times), so please look and research.
