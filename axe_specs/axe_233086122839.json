Please Note: All included items are shown in the pictures Right Handed Epiphone DOT ES-335-PRO Guitar 1255962638471 Features: The 335 Pro has a breakthrough guitar design when it was introduced in 1958. In many ways, the \"335\" was every bit as revolutionary as the solid-body Les Paul. The ES-335 put classic guitar styling - like the iconic archtop profile and violin inspire f-holes - into the hands of kids who were hungry to play rock and roll and look cool. The ES-335 was light. It was loud. And it definitely wasn't a traditional jazz guitar. Best of all, it was a new sound. What's included: Right Handed Epiphone DOT ES-335-PRO Guitar Condition: Guitar is used and in good working condition with light wear. Guitar has been tested and works great. 1255962638471 Payment & Checkout Checkout: After the auction has ended please click the checkout button to proceed with your payment.
