{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am trying once again to thin out my herd of stringed instruments. It\u2019s getting harder and harder since I am attached to all of them and have done custom work and mods on just about everything left in my collection. Here is a rare Jay Turser JT-50 (SG copy) with p-90 single coil style pickups. The first thing one notices, besides the P-90\u2019s is the stunning finish. They didn\u2019t make many with this pickup configuration and the asymmetrical body so it\u2019s almost like a custom shop model. This axe was made in the 90\u2019s or early 2000\u2019s at the China factory. All the newer ones were made in Viet Nam, then Korea after the Turser name was sold and they started manufacturing guitars for Best Buy and the like. This guitar is fast, loud and plays like a rocker, it\u2019s solid and built well as all the early Turser\u2019s were, earning them the best value in Guitar Player mag for a few years. I replaced the knobs with silver topped ball knobs (Guitar Fetish $13.95) and a chrome roller bridge (Guitar Fetish $21.95)\u2026that\u2019s all this guitar needed. The P 90's rock and play well clean. This is a beautiful guitar, like new with next to no fret wear and a near perfect body. Included is a gig bag, in which the guitar will be shipped, then boxed wrapped up in bubble wrap.I ship FexEx, I take a bit of a hit on the shipping but I like the tracking and reliability. Check out my other auctions, I will be listing about 20 guitars and basses and microphones in the next few months. I ship fast and currently own a 100% feedback rating as a buyer and seller on EBay (860+ transactions, a member since 2001).", "ItemID": "264035580344", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T01:12:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T01:12:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jay-Turser-Rare-JT-50-P-90-Pickups-Jet-Black-SG-style-guitar-/264035580344", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ogden, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640355803448080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDkwMA==/z/BzwAAOSwiuxb6NJr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/0kEAAOSwRytb6NJs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/6y8AAOSwhzhb6NJr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/L84AAOSwnJtb6NJs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/tuYAAOSwrAFb6NJr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/CBYAAOSwaalb6NJr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQzWDkwMA==/z/4xgAAOSwmLZb6NJq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blindedbyreality", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 886, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 910}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jay Turser Rare JT-50 P-90 Pickups Jet Black SG style guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jay Turser"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 209, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 105.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
