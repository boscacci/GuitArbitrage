{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "VINTAGE TOKAI LES PAUL JAPAN - The only true Reissue - Unique opportunity to come to a real dream guitar! Tokai guitars are considered the absolute crown of Japanese guitar makers. Perfect guitar making with attention to detail. The sound is exceptionally punchy. Absolute killer sound. Even vintage Tokais are considered as the ultimate of Japanese Tokai factory. In terms of originality, appearance and sound, they far surpass the Gibson originals from the same period. The guitar has a lot of dings and dongs, (see detail photos) but who can blame this on a nearly 40-year-old Tokai Lady. She was probably played and rocked with passion!
