{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1980s IBANEZ MC-900 MUSICIAN BASS Beautiful Dark Stain w/Original Case This is a superb bass made in Japan (the label on the back of the headstock is original and reads ''made in Japan''. It has a 34 inch scale with a mahogany and ash body and a five piece rock maple neck with two strips of walnut between the maple. This is a DS model - dark stain. There are two Ibanez Super 4 single coil soapbar pickups each with volume controls and a single tone control plus a three-way pickup selector switch. This is an active bass too, so it has an active on/off switch (controlled by a 9volt battery concealed in a compartment in the back of the body). There are also volume and tone active controls of course. The bridge/tailpiece is beautifully crafted and fully adjustable. This bass has a beautiful through neck with a 24 fret fingerboard, and the headstock has the two on a side Ibanez tuners, the ''Ibanez'' logo and the brass truss rod cover stamped with the word ''Musician''. This is an excellent bass in every way and a great player. It comes with original hard shell case.
