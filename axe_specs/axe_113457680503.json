{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "\u201cThis is a 2018 Fender American elite Stratocaster with ebony fingerboard. I had a professional luthier here in Houston install a Fender steel roller nut. The luthier used to build robin guitars here in Houston during their 1980\u2019s hay day so he definitely did a professional installation. I also installed a Dimarzio super distortion pickup in the bridge position to give it more output. I have the original shawbucker to go with guitar in case you would like to reinstall it. I also replaced the stock tortoise pickguards front and back with genuine Fender replacements in Parchment color. Really matches guitar color. Guitar is mint condition. Only had about 2 months. I am selling for holiday funds. Otherwise I would never sell it. My loss is your gain. Comes with original awesome Fender case as seen in pictures also comes with all original case candy, certificates and strap locks and tremolo arm. This thing never goes out of tune!!", "ItemID": "113457680503", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T15:25:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-16T15:25:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-Fender-American-Elite-Stratocaster-ebony-Dimazio-Super-Distortion-/113457680503", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kingwood, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134576805038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MZMAAOSwAQVcFm3C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/l8gAAOSw4VpcFm3H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qrgAAOSwBZBcFm3J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q7EAAOSwhhlcFm3L/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bf4AAOSwNXpcFm3O/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ciEAAOSw-yJcFm3R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nJ8AAOSwwtdcFm3W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XuEAAOSw4m9cFm3Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2qEAAOSwoEFcFm3c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9U8AAOSwwSJcFm3g/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/50MAAOSwgnJcFm3l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/38gAAOSwZtRcFm3n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "77345", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "slw51505150", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 291, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1132.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1132.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 90}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2018 Fender American Elite Stratocaster: ebony/Dimazio Super Distortion", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}]}, "HitCount": 153, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1157.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "\u201cThis is a 2018 Fender American elite Stratocaster with ebony fingerboard.
