{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful, in great shape, superb action, sweet sounds... Has a couple of smudges from playing a few times ( which can be cleaned off with a satin cleaner) No chips or dents, plays like butter and sounds beautiful! I now have D\u2019Addario 11\u2019s on there. Used a pencil to mark where bridge was when I changed strings. ( should come right off with satin polish/ cleaner ) The AFC125 features larger headstock design, 3-piece Mahogany/ Maple set-in neck and bound Ebony fretboard with hand rolled fret edge treatment provide maximum playing comfort and smooth articulation. Built with a Spruce top, Maple back and sides with Flamed Maple bound hollow body, all dressed in chic satin black finish. As well as providing its stylish appearance these elements provide a balanced tone, and with the addition of plywood top, help to avoid unnecessary feedback. The rock solid Ebony compensated bridge provides better intonation, longer sustain and acoustic resonance.

This tonal balance is complimented by the pickups\u2019 extra sensitivity that clearly captures and accentuates the players pick attack and plucking style opening the possibilities of a wide range of playing techniques. Thanks to floating mount, the \u201cMagic Touch-Mini\u201d pickups do not dampen the guitars natural body vibration, thus allowing a bigger richer acoustic tone. These are all complimented by the newly designed pickguard, tailpiece cover and wooden control knobs.", "ItemID": "202557048562", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T20:38:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T20:38:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Beautiful-Ibanez-AFC-125-Hollowbody-Electric-Guitar-Blk-Satin-Finish-/202557048562", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Stockton, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025570485628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RgYAAOSwAFFcLBtH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Un8AAOSw~5dcLBtL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PwgAAOSwe9FcLBtM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1pIAAOSwgrZcLBtO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I~IAAOSwBkNcLBtP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mVgAAOSwXc9cLBtR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~2IAAOSw3bZcLBtT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KTMAAOSwmvpcLBtU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7EMAAOSw8OFcLBtW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/K3AAAOSwAThcLBtZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/B0cAAOSw84ZcLBtb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PzcAAOSw-rxcLBtJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "95204", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jazylary", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 445, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 82}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Beautiful Ibanez AFC 125 Hollowbody Electric Guitar Blk Satin Finish", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}]}, "HitCount": 69, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent shape-looks beautiful, sounds even better!
