{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Just a great guitar! This is a 2005 model and she\u2019s really clean. The only blemish I can find is a hairline paint indent by the lower F hole, it wouldn\u2019t photograph. Extremely clean for a 2005 and these are made miles better than the Eddie Cochran signatures these days. I need a SG or I wouldn\u2019t let go of it. A cool guitar with rockabilly style, this Gretsch G6120W 1957 features an all maple body with an orange finish, oversize f-holes, and a G brand on the top. The bound rosewood fretboard has block inlays with Western engravings. It\u2019s equipped with a DynaSonic single coil pickup in the bridge position and a Fralin dogear single coil pickup at the neck. I replaced the original bar bridge with a tonepros roller bridge assembly and what a huge upgrade. She stays in tune and perfectly intonated. The original bridge is included. If you\u2019re looking for one of these...this would be the one.
