{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ok, we have here a 1965 Gretsch Viking, made here in the good ole US of A. As you can see, it was refinished purple sometime in the 70's or so. There's some lacquer checking, and that doesn't happen over night, so the 70's is a safe bet. Decent refinish. During the refinish, the holes for the 2 volume controls, the mute switch, the three way tone switch, the physical mute and switch, and hanging \"tuning fork\" bridge were all filled in. In addition to the above, the pickup holes with enlarged to have humbuckers installed.Then sometime in the 2000's, (I've had it 7 years.) someone decided to let his daughter paint it with \"flames\" in sparkle paint. Ye-ah.... I have re-drilled the 2 volume holes, and installed push/pull pots for the pickups volume controls. (The Master volume control pot has a treble bleed, and dates 1965.)The switching is for series/parallel, giving the guitar the normal single coil-ish tones. The pickups are GFS Retrotron Nashvilles. The three way tone switch, which was a common feature back then, is brought back to the vintage tone. (full tone, no tone, half tone) The electrical mute switch was re-drilled and rewired, to mute the guitar at the flip of a switch. (Stupid feature I know, but hey, it was the mid 60's.) Now, in cutting the pickup holes out to fit humbuckers, the genius cut thru the support beams that run from the tail of the guitar to the neck block. So when you touched the bridge, the top sagged a bit. I have added 2 supports under the bridge pickup, and that doesn't happen anymore. (I know, a lot of information, but full discloser and all that...) Also, the neck heel binding rotted away, and there is a few spots of the infamous Gretsch binding rot, but nothing to be concerned about. There is one or two spots where the bind is lifting along the neck joint. But it's been that way for the 7 years I have had it. Ok, got all that? The tuners, Bigsby, body, neck and master volume control are all original. The bridge is pinned and the intonation and action are PERFECT! it plays like butter, and sounds like the best of Duane Eddy and Chet, all rolled into one. The ebony board is sweet, and the frets have a LOT of life still in them. (It's possible it may have had a refet in it's life, but if so, who ever did it was a Master.) As you see in the pics, and yes, consider them part of the description, the back plate covering the cavity, under the pad, is not there. The pad itself, while original, could use re-padding. The pickguard, while NOT original, kinda fits. Yes there are some dings scrapes and other things I didn't mention, or take pics of. It's from 1965, expect some boo boos.
