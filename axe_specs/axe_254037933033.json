{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": ".Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states only,FedEx, no post office boxes because FedEx will not deliver to a post office box.I will not ship anywhere else. If you are viewing this ad from a mobil device make sure you take the time to read the full description and view the extra 20 pictures that are in the full ad. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone by Gibson Les Paul Special Custom Shop Limited Edition Slash AFD with some nice upgrades.These guitars feature a tuner built right into the bridge pickup ring,they work well and are a really nice feature. The guitar is in very good condition, just mild surface scratches. First I traded out the closed back tuners with some nice vintage looking Kluson style tuners[these tuners came from China so don't get too excited over the logos on the back]. You can still see some of the holes on the back of the headstock from the old cheapie tuners. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. I also changed the pickups to some nice humbucker size P90 pickups I just tried for the first time. I will be using these pickups alot more on guitars I hot rod.They have a great open clean tone but get plenty nasty with distortion. I then upgraded the stock tone capacitor with a nice .015uf Japanese mylar film cap. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody,instead of working. Most deliveries will require adult signature. I'm cleaning out my shop so check back for all kinds of other parts in the near future.
