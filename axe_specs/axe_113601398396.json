{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "FENDER AMERICAN SPECIAL TELECASTER, LAKE PLACID BLUE, TEXAS SPECIALS, OHSC, ROSEWOOD The American Special Telecaster puts U.S-made Fender quality into the hands of players at any level. For the guitarist who wants a combination of timeless Fender style and contemporary features, this guitar delivers traditional Tele design with some extra elements for modern tone and performance, including dual Texas Special pickups and special circuitry, modern neck profile and fingerboard radius, and more. Great sounding, great looking and feeling, and made in the United States. This Fender American Special Telecaster is a used item in close to excellent condition. This is a very clean used guitar with no major scratches, dings, or scuffs with the exception of light normal wear from playing in the usual spots. No rash. Electronics work as they should. The biggest item worth mentioning is that though this is a Lake Placid Blue finish, the lacquer coating has already started to age with yellowing and the finish has now an iridescence to it that from one angle shows the blue and another giving off a greenish tint. Kinda cool, but worth mentioning. You will receive this item well-packed in its original Fender case (some stickers on the outside). Please contact this seller for additional information.
