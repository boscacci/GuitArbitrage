Ibanez JS1000 at a Glance:Basswood body with Edge tremolo taipiece in Black Pearl finishMaple neck with rosewood fingerboardDiMarzio pickups (PAF Pro in neck position, Fred in bridge position)The Perfect Guitar To Take \"Surfing With The Alien\"Anyone who has heard Joe Satriani's original 1987 release, \"Surfing With The Alien,\" has heard the man wail on Ibanez guitars. Today, with his own signature edition instruments, all built to his exacting specifications - and with a little secret mojo mixed in for good measure - Joe is bringing down the house at concerts around the world (or melting down your CD player with his ninth studio album, \"Is There Love In Space?\"). For the JS1000, Joe selected lightweight basswood for the aerofoil-shaped body because of its comfort factor and excellent balance between highs and lows. The lustrous black pearl finish is understated, but guaranteed not to burst into flame no matter how hot your licks are!Multi-radius Prestige Maple Neck and Rosewood FingerboardThere's no reason to mess with a formula that's been time tested for half a century, so the JS1000 features a multi-radius Prestige maple neck and a rosewood fingerboard that's an exact digital rendering of the actual neck on Joe's favorite axe. And thanks to the deep cutaways on the JS1000's body, you get superb access to the upper frets for your most demanding solo work. Adding a touch of class are abalone dot inlays. Hey, if it's good enough for Joe...DiMarzio Pickups Deliver Tone For DaysWhat good is a sleek, sexy guitar if it doesn't have the tone to match. Thanks to the specially-designed DiMarzio pickups (a PAF Pro in the neck position and a Fred in the bridge position - hey, we didn't name these things), you can go from crystal clear to downright filthy just by adjusting your tone and volume knobs, because an exclusive highpass filter maintains a full tonal spectrum at all volume levels from a whisper to a full out, ear damaging roar!Ibanez JS1000 Features:Color: Black pearlBody Type: Solid body electricNeck Wood: MapleTop Wood: BasswoodBack Wood: BasswoodFingerboard: RosewoodNo. of Frets: 22Position Markers: Abalone dot inlaysScale Length: 25-1/2\"Pickups: DiMarzio PAF Pro (neck) and Fred (bridge)Controls: Tone and VolumeBridge/Tailpiece: Edge tremolo tailpiecePickup Switching: Toggle switchHardware: ChromeHardshell case included", "ItemID": "264120733592", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T09:49:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T05:09:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Joe-Satriani-JS1000-Electric-Guitar-/264120733592", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641207335928080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/7tAAAOSwfYpcMD5h/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/edUAAOSwVCpcM60B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/-IoAAOSwk4RcM60D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/gdEAAOSwNXpcM60F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/G5wAAOSwdwVcM60H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/zLsAAOSw0~pcM6z7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/X6oAAOSwXIdcM6z-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/E~oAAOSwa1ZcM60K/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/-dcAAOSwxL5cM60M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/t8sAAOSwN5hcM60O/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/hy0AAOSwvdFcM60Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/I-oAAOSwXHxcM60T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rocknroll_19_71", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 800, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 679.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 679.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3048}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Joe Satriani JS1000 Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JS 1000"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black pearl"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["JS1000"]}]}, "HitCount": 222, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=900238257", "StoreName": "musiciansmarket"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78626586", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Oceania", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
