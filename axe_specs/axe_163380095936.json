{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson 2004 Les Paul Standard, which I believe is in the Honeyburst finish. Looks more Honey than Heritage Cherry style to me. Comes with Hardshell TKL Flight Case. USA Serial # 02894327 - Nashville, TN - Oct 15, 2004 Beautiful guitar! Ok, so what's with \"Pappy\", right? I am not sure if this was done in the custom shop at Gibson, or by a luthier later on. If you look at the photos closely, you can see the outline of the Gibson logo just under Pappy. Easier to see in person. So, a little odd, but makes it a unique piece for sure. Overall, It looks like a legit Les Paul to me as far as I can tell. I have tried to check every possibly \"fake\" area on it that I know of. Even took this by a shop and they say it's a legit USA Gibson. The Pickups only say \"F\" and \"R\" underneath. No label, tag, number or anything. So, starting the price low and it is being sold as is, just in case! Mahogany Body & Neck, No Scarf Joint Honeyburst Finish Maple AA Flame Top Rosewood Fretboard Tune-O-Matic Bridge Stopbar Tailpiece Weight - Right at 8.6 lbs Overall very clean and looks great. Does have a few nicks and some light scratches here and there. I had a hard time trying to get the light scuffs to show in the photos. But chrome is very nice and still has that super glossy Gibson look. One of the pots need to be replaced, since a knob tab has popped off. Does not come with pickguard. It's basically in the same shape I found it, so it could use a slight setup along with fixing the pot. Very unique piece, hope it finds a good home! Thanks for looking and please ask any questions!On Nov-19-18 at 04:08:51 PST, seller added the following information: PLEASE KEEP IN MIND! I am not 100% sure this is a real Gibson. It looks like one to me, but I can\u2019t say for sure! So I am selling \u201cas is\u201d, since it\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a Chinese knock off. Still a great guitar, but PLEASE KNOW that it\u2019s a good chance this is not a real one!", "ItemID": "163380095936", "EndTime": "2018-11-25T01:00:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-18T01:00:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-2004-Honeyburst-/163380095936", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Franklinton, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633800959368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9lYAAOSwypZb4e7K/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aXcAAOSwTiVb4e69/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7PcAAOSwZ3pb4e7N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jaIAAOSwtaBb4e6-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tdIAAOSwzZNb4e7G/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/U~8AAOSwc1Zb4e7E/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mc0AAOSwJuZb4e7B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7~IAAOSwcnxb4e7L/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JIEAAOSwB5lb4e7D/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nMEAAOSwrmRb4e67/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3b0AAOSwNUlb4e7H/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lMIAAOSwaalb4e7A/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "27525", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "skipperfamily5", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 9990, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 27, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1186.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1186.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Standard 2004 Honeyburst ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 3209, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=27212261", "StoreName": "Broken Anchor Media"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1211.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
