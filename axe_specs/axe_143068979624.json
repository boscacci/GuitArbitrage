You are looking at a 2015 ESP LTD Kirk Hammett KH-202 Signature Guitar. Metallica axeman Kirk Hammett's signature guitar gives you a comfortable contoured basswood body that fits you like a glove, while a speedy maple neck and rosewood fingerboard pave the way for extremely fast fretting. The guitar's bolt-on design delivers sustain for weeks, while specially designed ESP humbuckers dish out a massive arsenal of tone and a Floyd Rose bridge serves up the vibe.Hammett's KH-202 delivers classic looks and performance Nothing screams hard rock like ESP's high-mass double-cutaway design, which gives the KH-202 incredible sustain and bite. Designed to resemble Kirk's original ESP without the road wear, its deep black finish sets off the iconic skull and crossbone inlays on the rosewood fingerboard. The dual ESP-designed extreme-gain humbuckers put out tons of confrontational tone with a 3-way pickup selector that lets you explore a vast tonal range. And a true Floyd Rose tremolo lets you pull off deep dive-bombs that always return to pitch.ESP Signature series guitars deliver the goods Working closely with the influential guitar players in their roster, ESP has built an impressive collection of artist signature instruments.
