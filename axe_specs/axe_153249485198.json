{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a used Godin Freeway SA Light Burst Flame Electric Guitar. The guitar has 2 voices: electrical and 13-pin synth-access. The guitar features: 1) Rock maple neck 2) Rosewood fingerboard with 12\" radius 3) Silverleaf maple body center with poplar wings 4) Tusq nut 5) 25-1/2\" scale 6) Floating tremolo bridge with Ghost saddle pickups and Hexpander Modular Preamp 7) 22 medium-jumbo frets 8) Godin GHN1 neck pickup, GS1 middle pickup, and GHB1 bridge pickup 9) 3-way mini toggle for output select 10) Standard 5-way pickup switch, volume and tone knobs 11) Ghost system synth controls: momentary mini toggle with separate volume 12) Includes gig bag . The Freeway SA delivers electric sounds via the Godin humbucker-single humbucker pickup configuration. Thanks to a special 5-way switch setup extra meaty humbucker tones co-exist with glassy split-coil sounds in the second and forth position. To run through these sounds in the Freeway use a standard guitar cord into your guitar amp. The 13-Pin Connection As with all of Godin synth-access instruments, a built-in 13-pin connector provides direct access to various devices. The 13-pin connector provides hexaphonic output-- hexaphonic is the term used to describe a system that sends a separate signal for each string. The guitar is in excellent condition and fully functional with no significant defects. The only scratch I could find on the guitar is on the left side of the body. The scratch is approximately 4mm long and approximately 0.10 mm wide\u2014 under normal conditions the scratch is difficult to see. I tested the synth on a Roland VG-99.
