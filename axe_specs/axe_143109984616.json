{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up today we have a killer Jackson WRXT Warrior. Made in Japan, so these are excellent quality guitars. Much better than the chinese one's being produced today. These came stock with the Seymour Duncan Designed Detonators. Which sound amazing. The blue maple flame top on this guitar is gorgeous in person. Pics don't do it justice. Guitar has been well cared for. For more info, please review the condition description and pics.
