{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The Godin xtSA Flame Electric Guitar's sound power begins withthree distinct voices: electric guitar, acoustic guitar and synth controller.The xtSA delivers big time electric sounds via the Godinhumbucker-single-humbucker pickup configuration. Thanks to a special 5-wayswitch setup, extra meaty humbucker tones co-exist with glassy split-coilsounds in the second and fourth positions. Turn down the electric output and raise the volume on the RMC transducersaddles and the xtSA sounds like an authentic acoustic guitar. The acousticvoice of the xtSA is enhanced by an onboard preamp with a three-way graphic EQ.The two outputs are set up so that the electric and acoustic voices can beblended in the guitar using a single patch cord or at the amp/mixer using bothoutputs. The icing on the xtSA cake comes in the form of its synth tracking. As with allGodin synth-ready instruments, a built-in 13-pin connector provides directaccess to all Roland GR-Series synths as well as most other 13-pin devices. All of this sound power would be a lot less interesting if the guitar didn'tfeel great. Thanks to the same 25\" scale mahogany neck used on the Godinflagship LGX-SA guitar, this is a very comfortable guitar to play. The ebonyfingerboard is shaped with Godin's ergocut technique and equipped with mediumjumbo frets.
