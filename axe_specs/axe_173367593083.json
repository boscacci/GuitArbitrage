Jazz Dream guitar at half the price. The Wes Montgomery Jazz guitar sound. Sounds amazing, plays amazing and looks awesome..

All electronics are solid and original. Frets are in great shape and the neck feels amazing.. plays effortlessly. The Witch hat knobs are in great shape. Has the original early 80's Gibson \"winding\" pop out winder tuners. Kalamazoo made USA GIBSON. No issues.. comes with 1980's era plush pink lining case.
