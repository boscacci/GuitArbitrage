{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Nice quality early 2000 Ernie Ball Music Man Silhouette guitar with original hard shell protective case. It is a turquoise(green blue) metal flake sunburst(unusual finish-attractive), rosewood neck, Schaller locking tuners, Dimarzio Virtual PAF Humbuckers and custom wound single coil, vibrato(vibrato arm is missing-standard), individual saddles for adjusting neck. See the specs and features below. This guitar has been played and has some scratches, some nicks, a long scratch/crack in the finish and at the butt of the guitar(see picturs), some dings, nothing structural at all, only cosmetic. The only wear on the neck are the 2nd and 3rd frets-G/B/E strings. The guitar was just set up with new strings, cleaned and is ready to plug and play. There is no buzzing, the guitar plays like a dream and sounds superb. Everything about it feels quality, nice smooth fast playing and even neck, versatile pickup choices, excellent USA all the way, and it stays in tune with the locking tuners. This is a great player and shows some cosmetic wear. It is a very nice unusual color. The neck is straight. The case is worn, one hinge is not working and there is a chunk of plastic broken off on one corner. It is still protective The shipping cost includes safe packing, insurance, prompt shipping and tracking number. Buy with confidence, see my feedback.
