{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Offering a 2006 Epiphone Les Paul Custom Korean made with gold appointments. Overall the guitar is in good to very good condition. It does not have a pick guard but replacements are easily available. This is a Custom model which features a binding on front and back as well as the fret marker starting on the first fret. I have replaced the stock nut with a bone nut, other than that it\u2019s all original. The the gold on the pickups has worn off for the most part and are more of a relic silver at this point. Has the typical light scratches you would expect for a guitar of this age. Well played but not abused. Please inspect pictures carefully as they are part of the description. I am setting the reserve fairly low as I need to thin my collection a bit. This is being sold without a case. Shipping to lower 48 states only, PayPal only and local pickup is always an option. Guitar will be packed carefully, insured for full purchase price and signature required.", "ItemID": "264075052576", "EndTime": "2018-12-12T23:06:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T23:06:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-Epiphone-Les-Paul-Custom-Made-Korea-/264075052576", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Barkhamsted, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640750525768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2ODY=/z/BbwAAOSwPAJcCFTH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qJgAAOSwXedcCFTL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XuMAAOSwE~ZcCFTM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NDA=/z/-SsAAOSw~HFcCFTH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODg=/z/3vsAAOSwwXRcCFTH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/umoAAOSwezRcCFTM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rAsAAOSwo1lcCFTP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MTY=/z/VTkAAOSwVRBcCFTO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GmMAAOSwus5cCFTQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NzA=/z/Ro0AAOSwHGJcCFTO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06063", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "juicedvenom", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 29, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 292.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 292.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***7", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2006 Epiphone Les Paul Custom Made In Korea", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}]}, "HitCount": 509, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 297.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
