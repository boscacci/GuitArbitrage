{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for your consideration is a 2001 Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Includes a gig bag, which the zipper on the top pocket isn\u2019t working, but all others do. The guitar is in very good condition, a few marks here and there, but nothing into the wood. Not abused by any means. There are upgraded pickups in the guitar. The neck and middle pickups are Texas Specials, and the bridge is a DiMarzio Area 61. I found this to be a really nice combination. Recently set up, plays great! I have too much equipment, and a daughter going to college soon. I also will be posting more amps and guitars, please check my other auctions. Everything listed will already be priced to sell. All sales are final, no returns. Everything is described and photographed accurately as it leaves my house.I have sold many guitars and related equipment on Ebay over the years, you can bid in confidence. Shipping is for USA only. If you are local, pick up can be arranged. Feel free to ask any questions. Thank you.", "ItemID": "332895782978", "EndTime": "2018-11-28T14:52:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-21T20:38:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2001-Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Upgraded-Pickups-and-Gig-Bag-/332895782978", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Grand Island, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328957829788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/KQ0AAOSwa3Zbx5sx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/1bMAAOSwUVhbx5tg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/HTgAAOSwnz9bx5tj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/73IAAOSwpw5bx5tj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/DKgAAOSwgYdbx5tg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/krQAAOSwyEdbx5tg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/nxwAAOSworhbx5tj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/~FYAAOSwOrpbx5th/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/8~4AAOSwJ6Nbx5tm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/f4gAAOSw3S5bx5tm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/8CMAAOSwL4Rbx5tj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "14072", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wakuhn1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 893, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.8}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 382}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2001 Fender American Standard Stratocaster Upgraded Pickups and Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}]}, "HitCount": 311, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 659.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
