The Body has the radical Explorer Hamer Scarab Body and is made of Alder Wood with the Tune-A-Matic Bridge. The neck is made of Maple with a Rosewood Fret Board. Even though the Guitar has Some Dings on the Front & Dings, Scratches, Belt Buckle Rash on the Back, None of the Dings Penetrate the Paint itself and are in the Heavy Duty Clear Coat That Makes This Guitar Shine. That's why they are hard to capture on camera (pictures 9 & 10). The Guitar Looks Great and Sounds Great. Everything Works perfectly on the Guitar and Everything is there and is original. The Guitar comes in a Beautiful Heavy Duty Black Hamer Case that is in Outstanding Condition with No Issues. This Hamer Scarab XT is a Great Guitar and one Heck of an AXE!!! This is The Best Guitar That Hamer Ever Made!!!
