{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "SCHECTER C1 FR with EMG 81 & Sustaniac Pickups Neck Thru Construction, Floyd Rose Tremolo, Satin Redburst Finish Nice Guitar, Great Playing This is a used guitar but well cared for that plays and looks great. No breaks or repairs. Not beat up or abused. The body is mahogany with a nice quilted maple veneer top and a 3 piece maple neck that is set into the body with a heel contour is so smooth you would think it is a neck through construction. The frets show almost zero wear and the fretboard could use some cleaning but otherwise it is a beautiful guitar that plays and sounds great. This guitar is nearly two years old (2017 model). It features a Floyd Rose tremolo and EMG 81 pickup in the bridge position and the Sustaniac neck pickup. Cosmetically this is one nice guitar with just a few light marks in the satin finish and one tiny mark through the finish on the top where you arm might rest when playing, see photos. If you are looking at a new one it will set you back $859 at the major retailers. Buy this one here for hundreds less! Includes the case shown in the photo below which is older and has some paint spatter on the outside but hinges and latches are good. Questions? Please ask. Thanks!
