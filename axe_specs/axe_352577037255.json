{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Esp GH-600 Black case. Retail price was $1199 Gary Holt of Slayer and Exodus is a legend in the world of thrash metal. His LTD Signature Series GH-600 is based on the Eclipse body style, and was designed by Gary himself to\u00a0handle the most aggressive, fast, and powerful playing you can muster. Its tone is driven by a pair of red-covered EMG active pickups: the EMG 89R in the neck, with a coil splitter controlled by a volume knob pull switch, and the in-your-face EMG 81\u00a0in the bridge. The GH-600NT offers a set-thru neck design, with its\u00a0three-piece mahogany neck going deep into the guitar's mahogany body cavity for terrific stability and smooth, unhampered access to the highest frets on its ebony fingerboard. This guitar's vibe is accentuated by red binding on the body, neck, and headstock contrasting its glossy Black finish. The GH-600NT includes a Floyd Rose tremolo and Grover tuners.", "ItemID": "352577037255", "EndTime": "2019-01-29T14:59:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T17:08:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-Electric-Signature-Guitar-Black-GH-600-Gary-Holt-Slayer-Exodus-Used-/352577037255", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Long Beach, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525770372558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDAw/z/HNwAAOSwwgBcSe-C/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XyUAAOSwpYxcSe9-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk4/z/5FMAAOSwCgtcSe99/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z8kAAOSwWrxcSe9~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTE0/z/5EQAAOSwJQVcSe-B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jxoAAOSwO-hcSe-F/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDA2/z/1BEAAOSwpptcSe-D/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iGsAAOSwfepcSe-E/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rJMAAOSwlfNcSe-G/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90815", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dagonz-3092", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 110}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "\u00a0ESP LTD Electric Signature Guitar Black GH-600 Gary Holt Slayer Exodus Used", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 64, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
