{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "62' Stratocaster RI. Japanese Ash 3-color sunburst(All body routes on this '62 RI are original and untouched.The body is a 1992 fender 2 piece, from the FujiGen factory with the attention to detail and precise fit and finish work that has made the early Fender Japan instruments sought after by studio players and serious collectors alike.)Of course the very first thing I did was to rip out all the electronics and hardware that was mij and replace everything (I mean everything) with '62 RI made in the USA components The entire tremolo system is '62 RI vintage, notice the gray bobbin pickups they are so sweet, the input jack is original '62 RI switchcraft, cts pots, orange cap, '62 RI fender RI 5-way switch, even the period correct wiring! Wow what a sound. I love the look, sound and feel of this guitar. Unfortunately a while ago the neck developed a crack at the headstock and rather than repair it I decided to replace it with a 1992 '57 RI neck. I have too many guitars so I've decided to thin my collection. Everything, the electronics and hardware are all 100% fender RI originals. Everything in this guitar is top quality. Please ask any questions you may have. Cosmetically, this is an extremely clean guitar which exhibits only 2 small swirls in the finish (back), 1 small nick top bottom edge and 1 <dime sized ding in the finish near the edge towards the back. It is not visible from the front at all. There are very few scuffs on the guitar as a whole and the neck shows ABSOLUTE minimal wear. It is a beautiful instrument and I'm sure you will be very, very happy with this strat. It does come with a fender reissue tweed case.", "ItemID": "173650205371", "EndTime": "2018-11-21T20:02:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T20:03:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-62-RI-Stratocaster-MIJ-1992-Sunburst-tweed-case-/173650205371", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Haverhill, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736502053718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/j~cAAOSwTFBbxPBJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/PIgAAOSwuVtbxPBS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/IaoAAOSw40pbxPBe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/U3QAAOSw~29bxPBl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/nUsAAOSwjE1bxPBq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/p4MAAOSwviFbxPBy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/SjEAAOSw1IVbxPB5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/02wAAOSwFYZbxPB~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/k5kAAOSw9E5bxPCI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/dokAAOSwJTNbxPCQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01830", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ej35910", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 126, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 810}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender '62 RI Stratocaster MIJ 1992, Sunburst - with tweed case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["141100300", "141100309"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["141100300"]}]}, "HitCount": 26, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 660.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78630389", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
