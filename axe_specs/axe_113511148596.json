{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "RARE Vintage 1963 Gretsch 6109 Peppermint Twist Corvette electric guitar == The rare Corvette Red with Candy-striped pickguard variation of Gretsch's solid-body Corvette was only produced 1961 to 1963 -- the 1961 & 62 models had the somewhat inconvenient truss rod adjustment at the heel with a truss rod cover on top of the pickguard -- while only the last production year 1963's have the better conventional truss access at head -- so this is the rarest Twist variation == VG 7/10 All Original condition & presents very nicely -- original \"Quality Control\" card (!) with hand-written model \"6109\" and serial number matching the one on top of headstock, original red & white reverse-painted clear pickguard in beautiful shape, original red knobs, original HiLo-tron pickup, original tailpiece/bridge/pickup metal parts in great shape, original Kluson Deluxe tuners in good shape with some patina & one bent shaft (works fine) -- wear to finish, scratches, dings, finish chips edges and back mainly, crack on treble side of heel/back as shown & finish cracks around heel/back as shown, apparently old and it's stable, fret wear and wear to fretboard, fretboard dots shrunken with 3 missing and replaced (I'll include more 6mm dots so you can replace all if desired) == Excellent player with straight 24 1/2\" scale neck , action perfect at just under 3/32\" 12th fret low E and 1/16\" high E, plays great all the way up == And it SOUNDS GREAT -- Gretsch with an LP Jr/Melody Maker vibe == Chipboard case has lots of wear with tears along edges -- we used gorilla glue and heavy cardboard to reinforce/repair tears by latches and hinges so case is functional == Case goes great with this guitar -- you take the Twist out of the obviously old case and everyone looks! Vintage and So Cool! == So, it's not perfect but plays great -- and the 1963 Twist is one of the MOST RARE variations of not only the iconic Gretsch Corvette, but of all Gretsch models == Note: we should have new export permits covering all rosewoods in the next few weeks -- International buyers please inquire == Worldwide Shipping -- NOTE: International buyers NOTE: CITES as of 1 Jan. 2017 restricts all rosewoods (although most are not endangered!!) -- our guitars may have rosewood components; check with your local customs to determine if this affects shipping to your country before purchase == If you are considering a purchase, please take a minute and read our feedback !!!
