{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Artisan version of the Les Paul is in as close to new condition as your likely to find. Everything is original (I'm the original owner) including the finish which only has 2 small scratches on the back. The Ebony fretboard with abalone inlays is in near perfect condition. It may actually be a 1977 but I bought it new in 1978. These guitars were manufactured in Kalamazoo Michigan as a custom edition and were produced in very small numbers. It hasn't been played in over 35 years due to a severe left hand injury and other than an annual wipe down never gets touched. I finally decided it's too nice to be a sitting unused and am reluctantly selling it. I'm not the greatest photographer but if seriously interested I can get different shots of specific areas.", "ItemID": "254057520718", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T23:23:44.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T20:52:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Artisan-Electric-Guitar-/254057520718", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Howell, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540575207188080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/Jg0AAOSw0xtcM7Yi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/QZgAAOSw~odcM7Yk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/mMIAAOSwuQhcM7Yv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/WWYAAOSwltxcM7Y2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/bMgAAOSwHSdcM7Y6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/Cm0AAOSw5tNcM7Y-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/HVYAAOSwsqxcM7ZA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/TZcAAOSwo1lcM7ZF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/6DoAAOSwoylcM7ZH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/2H4AAOSwGq5cM7ZM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/bq0AAOSwkDtcM7ZN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/lYYAAOSwH4dcM7ZS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48843", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "molitor2086", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 115, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 983}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Artisan Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1978"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Artisan"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Triple pickup"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple", "Ash", "Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["LPSANSCH1"]}]}, "HitCount": 65, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78627826", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
