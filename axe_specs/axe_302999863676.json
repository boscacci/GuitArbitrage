I exchange nuts and feel new (neither is me but a former owner) Truss rods are not totogether and I do not even see them, so I do not know the state. I do not think there is any need to mess with it at the present. There are no scratches at all There is almost no flat on the back side There are scratches on the corner edge of the back and sides but it is not like something made by bumps, It is peeling The attached hard case is also considered to be of the same age.
