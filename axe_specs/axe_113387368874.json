{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "IBANEZ JEM77WDP CNL Woody 2017 Steve Vai w/Ibanez PowerPad gigbag Serial #: I170220476 Wow! Have a look at this 2017 Ibanez JEM77WDP CNL! Charcoal Brown Low Gloss finish w/Poplar Burl veneer pickguard and wood tone and volume knob tops. 3.2kg! Serial number on the headstock back. Mahogany body, 5pcs. Maple/Walnut Prestige Wizard Premium neck w/KTS Titanium rods, jumbo frets, factory standard Dark Matter 2 middle single coil pickup and Dimarzio Dark Matter 2 bridge and neck humbuckers w/decorative etched covers, 5way JEM toggle switch, Edge Zero II tremelo bridge, and Tree Of Life fretboard inlay! This one is a factory 2nd and has only been test played. Reason for the factory 2nd is as you can see in the photos there is a symmetrical scratch in the gloss finish on the neck back nut area. This scratch is in gloss finish only and does not extend into the wood. It came out of the factory this way of course and I did not find it to affect play or functionality in any way when I tested it. That said I am selling it as a used instrument as it has been played a bit. Overall I'd say that it's in nice shape! Little bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the body, headstock, and neck are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic! Thick beefy sound with the Dark Matter 2 humbuckers and a wide variety of classic JEM tone capability available with the toggle and pickup configuration! I found this one to be an excellent player! As it does have an Edge Zero II floating tremelo bridge and locking nut please adjust and fine tune the tension to your personal taste and playing style. Awesome looking great sounding JEM!
