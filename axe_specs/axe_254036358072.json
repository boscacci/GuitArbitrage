{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I have listed this nice guitar as a project because I bought a used husk body and then hand selected the parts and did the custom wiring.I have been playing and setting up my own guitars for over 50 years, so this was not my first rodeo.This guitar is not a chambered body, and weighs in a just under 8lbs. I have no idea who made the body, but the head stock had been sanded down to the wood, so it has been repainted.The pickups are Fullerton style Alnico 5's. Neck 7.4k Bridge 8.5kThe pots are CTS 500k with .022uf orange drop caps.Guitar is wired to a diagram that I found that was supposedly used on one of Peter Green's guitars.The neck is straight and very nice, great frets, and super nice action.I have the neck set with a slight relief for my playing style.Guitar does show signs of use, re paint on the head stock, some small dings on the back, and normal fine scratches from being played.This is a players guitar, but would be a super first guitar, or hot rod mod platform.Sold as is, and no case, but will be very well packed and shipped.", "ItemID": "254036358072", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T20:15:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-22T20:15:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Project-Les-Paul-body-type-electric-guitar-/254036358072", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Freeport, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540363580728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/paEAAOSwXitcHpla/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jccAAOSwI1VcHplp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f4IAAOSwbKdcHpl4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/S-8AAOSwcDdcHpmK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/T4cAAOSwxPNcHpmZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/woMAAOSwqnlcHpmt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lbUAAOSwuJRcHpm9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K1gAAOSwH1pcHpnN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/G6AAAOSwGD1cHpnd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "61032", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ranger69black", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1048, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3925}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Project Les Paul body type electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["LP style"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 594, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 152.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This is a used guitar that was custom built from selected parts.The guitar shows signs of use and wear.Please read description.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
