{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "All original and as found except for a set of Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings and some polish. Very playable and buzz-free all the way up and down the fretboard as it sits. I\u2019m not sure if/how action can be adjusted to taste, but if you\u2019re reading this you probably know. My advice would be to leave it alone. If ultra low action shredding is your thing, it\u2019s probably best to pull an Ibanez out of the rack. Condition is spectacular. It was likely produced between 1960-64. The pots are by some accounts an indicator of exact year; I\u2019d really rather not pull the guard and risk stripping screws and mucking up old and likely fragile components and connections. The electronics are unmolested, work perfectly, and I prefer to keep them that way on my watch. The chrome bits have oxidation and light pitting but still present well. Screws on the guard have rusty heads, but could be replaced if you decide to deviate from an all original piece. The fretboard is nearly flawless, just some trace evidence of use in cowboy chord territory. The body has no buckle rash and no paint loss except for the peak of the cutaway and a mark on the right side. The neck finish is nearly perfect, just a couple of chips and impressions in the clear coat. Speaking of that, the clear coat in its entirety is in good shape but has crazing consistent with its age. The headstock has edge wear and chipping as pictured. There are no structural issues or signs of misuse or improper storage. The only damage I can find is a slightly bent D/top left tuner shaft.", "ItemID": "202580718803", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T12:37:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T02:26:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Early-1960s-Harmony-Alden-H45-Stratotone-Guitar-Unrestored-Original-/202580718803", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Ortonville, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025807188038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI1OFg5MDA=/z/yjYAAOSwzgtcJk6v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzMFg1MTE=/z/aa0AAOSwOnJcJlDV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1MVg5NTA=/z/WL4AAOSwdHpcJknl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1OFg3OTI=/z/-kUAAOSwCWNcJkr9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VxQAAOSwnCdcJkns/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8P0AAOSwt3hcJlKc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTQ4WDE1MzE=/z/mJAAAOSw1rpcJk46/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zg8AAOSw8zNcJlKW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EiUAAOSwHglcJlKY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q9IAAOSw8zRcJknu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTk4WDE1NTI=/z/NTIAAOSwFAtcJk44/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUzMFg3NjA=/z/G3AAAOSwVYhcJlRk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48462", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fporter66", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 279, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.4}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 139}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Early 1960s Harmony Alden H45 Stratotone Guitar Unrestored Original", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Harmony"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1960's"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratotone"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 48, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1143178128", "StoreName": "Kay Curry Oso"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
