{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe GoldTop. The guitar is in Excellent condition, and includes the original hard case. I have enjoyed this guitar immensely over the past few years, and will be sad to see it go. This is a beautiful guitar. The gold finish is pristine. There is only one small blemish on the back near the strap pin that has been there since I got the guitar. Otherwise, the guitar is mint. I only played this guitar at home. Never taken to gigs, and always stored in the case. I also have the pickgaurd and bracket. I only took it off for aesthetic purposes. It has been stored in a bag in the case since I removed it. The guitar features: Genuine pearl inlays. Mini humbuckers with 15db boost, and coil splitting. These are great pickups, and with the boost and coil splitting, they are extremely versatile. The guitar has the original g-force tuners. I thought about switching them out when I first got the guitar, but to be honest, I love the convenience of the tuners. I've had this guitar for three years, and haven't had to charge the tuner more than once \u2013 and it is a breeze to use with alternate tunings. They are easy enough to switch out, if you decide to do so. The body feels rather light, with 9-hole weight relief. If you have any questions, requests for more information, and or photos, do not hesitate to ask. Condition is Used. Shipped with UPS Ground.
