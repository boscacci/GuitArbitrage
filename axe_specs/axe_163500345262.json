The Transparent Black model features off-natural body binding, a black headstock and black chrome hardware; the Snow White features black hardware and a black headstock. \u00a0 Body Material:\u00a0Basswood Inlays:\u00a0Dots Number of Frets:\u00a022 Scale Length:\u00a025.5 inches Nut Width:\u00a01.635 inches Neck Material:\u00a0Maple Fretboard Material:\u00a0Maple Finish/Color:\u00a0Snow White Bridge Pickup:\u00a0EVH Wolfgang Humbucking Neck Pickup:\u00a0EVH Wolfgang Humbucking Case:\u00a0None", "ItemID": "163500345262", "EndTime": "2019-01-26T19:19:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-23T00:03:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2017-EVH-Wolfgang-Standard-Electric-Guitar-Snow-White-USED-/163500345262", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635003452628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/jdoAAOSw8~hcR69V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/UQIAAOSwWAhcR69V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/TakAAOSw5r1cR69W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/7sAAAOSwnKFcR69V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/dDYAAOSweI1cR69V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/mSwAAOSwxrJcR69W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/RxEAAOSwMYtcR69W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/2Z0AAOSw3fZcR69X/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/i50AAOSwvEhcR69W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/AuIAAOSw~xtcR69W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "03101", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mmusicmill", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6378, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 383.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 383.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 53}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2017 EVH Wolfgang Standard Electric Guitar Snow White (USED)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["EVH Guitars & Amps"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 70, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=51272484", "StoreName": "Manchester Music Mill"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "Middle East", "Oceania", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "SKU": "stdu", "NewBestOffer": false}
