{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Time to thin the herd so I can buy Xmas presents for the family! up for sale here is a nice, near new condition PRS SE Bernie Marsden Signature Edition electric guitar in a beautiful sunburst finish. There are a few minor swirl scratches that don't show up in the pics, but otherwise it's in great working order. i have the nice PRS Padded gig-bag that comes with it (not pictured). It has a very nice heavy body with lots of resonance and sustain. It's in really good shape, could use some new strings and setup to your liking. I've played it only at home, has never left my smoke free house. I will pack carefully upon receipt of verified U.S. Paypal user with a valid U.S. address.
