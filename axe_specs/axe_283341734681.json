In no way do these marks detract from what is an absolutely stunning guitar.", "ItemID": "283341734681", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T23:55:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T23:55:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-Plus-Deluxe-90-91-Blue-Burst-w-Tremolo-Radiohead-Guitar-/283341734681", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Dallas, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833417346818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DyIAAOSwltxcP8BD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DNQAAOSwUHBcP8BV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GsIAAOSwHSdcP8Bd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3VkAAOSwBMpcP8Bl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aI0AAOSwVN1cP8Bu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ye8AAOSw5cZcP8B4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H9EAAOSw3-9cP8CN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~RkAAOSwKc1cP8CV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iGIAAOSwJb5cP8Cd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kb0AAOSwWDlcP8Cs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1foAAOSwZnpcP8Cx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/47AAAOSwLX5cP8DP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "75220", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fontoozle", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 862, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 14, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1625.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1625.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster Plus Deluxe 90-91 - Blue Burst w/ Tremolo - Radiohead Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Plus Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 487, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
