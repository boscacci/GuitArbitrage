{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a Gibson Custom Shop Gary Rossington Signature 1959 Reissue Les Paul. This one is #120. This is from the well known run of 250 guitars made in 2002-2003. The run of guitars was aged by Tom Murphy who spent a lot of time on each instrument. It looks and feels fantastic and plays / sounds great. I bought the guitar used a few years ago and have played it occasionally in my smoke free / pet free home. Everything was stock when I received it. I have not made any changes. I believe a previous owner had replacement pickups and tuners on it but the stock parts were restored before it was sold. I do not have the display case, custom care kit or grease monkey shirt. Here is Gibson's Press Release from July 2002. Gibson Custom debuts LE Gary Rossington Les Paul Gary Rossington, original guitarist for Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Gibsons Custom, Art & Historic division are teaming up to produce the Limited Edition Gary Rossington Les Paul. The signature guitar celebrates Rossingtons pioneering spirit and the enduring musical legacy of his hard-driving, Southern Rock sound. The finish on the Rossington Les Paul is aged and well-worn to replicate Rossingtons instrument, which he acquired from a woman whose boyfriend had abandoned her, leaving behind only his guitar. At one point Rossington broke the headstock and used a pair of small screws to repair it. While the new model replicates the screws, it does not replicate the break. Other features of the Rossington Les Paul include a figured maple top with one-piece mahogany back and Rossington sunburst finish, nickel-plated 57 Classic pickups, aged nickel hardware, a 59 Les Paul neck, rosewood fingerboard with trapezoid inlays and cream pickguard.The limited edition model only 250 will be produced comes with a Les Paul reissue case, Skynyrd Certificate of Authenticity, wall-hanging display case with photo backdrop, Custom care kit and Gibson/Skynyrd grease monkey shirt. As a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rossington helped define Southern Rock music with memorable guitar work on such classics as Free Bird and Sweet Home Alabama. Three of the bandmembers, including lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, died in a plane crash in 1977 and guitarist Allen Collins died in 1986 from complications after a 1982 car crash. The band will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2003. **Shipping cost does not include insurance.
