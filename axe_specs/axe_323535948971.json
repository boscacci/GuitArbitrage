You'll love the Les Paul Standard's premium features, such as the modern weight-relieved body that still packs ample sustain. The mahogany neck sports the SlimTaper neck profile and compound-radius rosewood fretboard for fast and fluid fretwork. And with the Gibson Les Paul Standard's dual Burstbucker Pro pickups with coil tapping, phase reversal, and pure bypass, you'll have all the guitar tones you'll need.Plek'd for precision playabilityThis Les Paul Standard 2018 feels fast and precise, thanks in large part to Plek processing. Typically reserved for top-dollar custom guitars, this process levels the frets with pinpoint precision, providing you with the most playable fretboard you're likely to own. Each note rings loud and clear, and the fret edges feel smooth as silk.Compound-radius fretboardThe Les Paul Standard 2018 features a compound-radius fretboard for fantastic playability. The fingerboard features a standard Gibson 10\" radius near the nut for a familiar feel that offers easy chording and rhythm playing. As you move up the fretboard, it gradually flattens out to a 16\" radius. This flatter feel is extremely popular for the way it enables easier single-note runs and wide string bends that won't fret out. Compound-radius fretboards are the best of both worlds and feel completely natural.PAF humbucker tone with coil tappingWhen it comes to capturing that classic Les Paul tone, nothing beats the sound of this Les Paul Standard 2018's PAF-style Burstbucker humbucking pickups. You'll love the tight low end, complex midrange, and sweet highs you'll get out of these pickups. And for more tonal flexibility than ever, the Les Paul Standard 2018 sports coil-tapping, phase-reversal, and pure-bypass electronics, all at the touch of a push-pull knob.Gibson Les Paul Standard 2018 Features:Flagship Les Paul with modern updatesModern weight-relieved body reduces weight while maintaining sustainCompound-radius fretboard facilitates chording and single-note workDual push-pull volume controls switch between single-coil and humbucking operationPush-pull neck tone controls pickup phase reversalPush-pull bridge tone control activates Pure Bypass modeSelf-lubricating TekToid nutDurable and precise locking Grover kidney-button tunersPlek'd for precision playability Tech SpecsBody TypeSolidbody, Ultra Modern weight reliefBody ShapeLes PaulLeft-/Right-handedRight-handedNumber of Strings6Body MaterialMahoganyTop MaterialAAA Figured MapleBody FinishGloss Nitrocellulose LacquerColorCobalt BurstNeck MaterialMahoganyNeck ShapeAsymmetrical Slim TaperRadiusCompoundFingerboard MaterialRosewood, cream bindingFingerboard InlayAcrylic TrapezoidNumber of Frets22, Medium profileScale Length24.75\"Nut Width1.695\"Nut MaterialTektoidBridge/TailpieceAluminum tune-o-matic bridge with aluminum stopbar tailpieceTunersGrover Locking KidneyNeck PickupBurstBucker Pro Rhythm HumbuckerBridge PickupBurstBucker Pro Lead HumbuckerControls2 x volume (push/pull coil-tap), 2 x tone (push/pull pure bypass, phase), 3-way toggle pickup switchStrings.009-.046Case IncludedHardshell caseManufacturer Part NumberLPS18CXCH1", "ItemID": "323535948971", "EndTime": "2018-11-08T21:14:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-06T03:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-w-Case-Blue-Cobalt-Burst-Mint-ships-free-/323535948971", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Greenbelt, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235359489718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lukAAOSwOsFb4JxR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/76EAAOSwIDBb4JxO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XLQAAOSw--xb4JxS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDM3NA==/z/m8MAAOSwhu9b4JtZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/dw4AAOSwnFpb4Jtd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/SxcAAOSwKDpb4Jtd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/6oUAAOSwG-xb4Jta/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/0B8AAOSwQZVb4Jtc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/fRgAAOSwUm5b4Jtd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/3AYAAOSw4c5b4Jta/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/HogAAOSwhnhb4Jtd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDUwMA==/z/0K8AAOSw-pNb4Jtc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "20770", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rockandrollero", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 275, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2210.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2210.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 235}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2018 Gibson Les Paul Standard w/ Case Blue Cobalt Burst *** Mint, ships free ***", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 0, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2235.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
