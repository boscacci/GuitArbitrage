Epiphone Sheraton II PRO Electric Guitar w/ Case - Ebony - 2ND See our other items Hailed by blues legend John Lee Hooker as \"an out-did 335,\" the Sheraton has been renown for decades for its combination of superior tone and beautiful pearloid and abalone inlay. The new Epiphone Sheraton-II PRO honors Epiphone's most influential \"thin-line\" semi-hollowbody electric archtop, featuring critically acclaimed ProBucker\u2122 pickups with coil-splitting and a Graphtech\u00ae NuBone XL\u2122 nut. This particular guitar has a noticeable scratch in the clearcoat on the back of the body and a mark on the backside of the nut. Apart from what we have described this guitar is in mint condition, factory plastic still on the pickguard! How Does It Play? This is a beautifully-built semi-hollow guitar. It delivers big bell-like tones with its semi-hollow design and excellent ProBucker pickups. We have given the guitar a good pro setup to make sure it is fully ready to play with low action and no fretbuzz. The action is setup under 5/64\" on the low E at the 12th fret and under 4/64\" on the high E at the 12th fret. The Epiphone hard case pictured is included!
