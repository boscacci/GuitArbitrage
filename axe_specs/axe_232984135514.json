{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2002 Fender Zebrawood Strat This RARE '02 Fender Custom \"Zebrawood\" '68 re-issue STRAT, was only manufactured for the Japanese Market. This Fender is a very rare and beautiful limited edition, only produced between 2002 and 2004.This Stratocaster features an exotic double-bound Zebrawood body with an Alder center and a bound Maple neck with block mop inlays. It also features factory-installed upgraded Texas-Special pick-ups.The musicians who have played this Fender... say it feels like a cross between a '68 STRAT and a vintage Hamiltone Guitar. The 1968 Reissue Fender Japan Custom Zebrawood Stratocaster is one of the most interesting strats in my collection. It is very light, due to the chambered body, and the neck/fretboard is bound beautifully, as is the body. It has USA vintage pickups stock and sounds incredible. The wood is extremely rare, which is why they didn't make many of these originally in 1968, and it is also the reason why Fender Japan didn't make many reissues of them either. It really is a collector's dream stratocaster. I've had a lot of Strat-style guitars, but this one is very special. You could have hundreds of them lined up and most people would pick this one as the most beautiful. Its fit, finish and tone are done with astounding attention to detail. Do your own research. You don't see one of these for sale very often and it may be sometime before you see one again.
