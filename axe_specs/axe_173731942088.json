{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Guitar Peak In the North Georgia Mountains 706-896-7738 678-314-1240 ***Gibson Flying V Faded*** We're offering this 2011 Gibson Flying V Faded in the Worn Cherry finish. Please see all the pics. The original 1958 V was ahead of its time and was reissued just 9 years later(1967), becoming a favorite of a lot of players. This V has most of the features of that '67 model with the look of a faded and worn guitar. Specs from Gibson: Solid Mahogany body for tone, sustain, and performance; headstock carved out of the same piece of Mahogany as the neck and angled 17 degrees, increasing pressure on the strings to help them stay in the nut slots and for better sustain; The neck is a hybrid of the \u201950s rounded contour and the \u201960s slim-taper profile; 22-Fret Rosewood fingerboard constructed from \"the highest grade rosewood on the planet\"; 12-inch radius fingerboard and nickel and silver alloy \u201cmedium/jumbo\u201d frets for smooth note bending and elimination of \u201cchoked out\u201d notes. The electronics consist of Gibson's 496R and 500T pickups: The 496R produces sustain and cutting power with its ceramic magnet, adding more highs with no muddiness. The 500T is one of Gibson\u2019s most powerful pickups, with a three ceramic magnet structure, for rock and roll crunch with enhanced lows and crystal clear highs. There are volume controls for each and master tone control for less resistance between the pickups and output, plus a 3-way selector switch. Other features include a Tune-O-Matic bridge, stop bar tail, Grover Kluson-style \"green\" keys, black tophat knobs with silver inserts, Corian nut, Flying V truss rod cover with Gibson logo, pearloid dot inlays, and 24 3/4\" scale length. This instrument plays great, sounds great and is in excellent condition, and includes the original Gibson gig bag, Gibson owner's manual, and inspection checklist.
