{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Find more pics here: CLICK for 20+ DETAILED PICS! Thanks for checking in. Here I am selling my Ibanez JS1, I believe it is the early version with serial number is at J 000082. As you can see in the pics, it has many minors. Also, unfortunately the sound is not working. I have no idea if the problem is in the pickups or in the circuit. So I'd like to sell this to you who can repair. If you have anything to ask, feel free to reach out to me via Q&A. Best \u25c6 Shipping and Packaging CONCERN ABOUT THE GUITAR SAFETY???? I have sent many guitars outside and never had a problem. My packaging is very very safe!! Better than any of Japanese sellers here in ebay! You can trust that!! Check the pic below!! I pack very carefully and full with bubble wrap outside. I use EMS service for shipping methods. It`s the most safe and quickly way of shipping from Japan and only takes 2 to 5 days from Japan to USA,CANADA,3 to 7 days to Asia, Australia and Europe. The rate is $130 to everywhere!! Actually it will be around 160 to 180 I have to pay, but it is OK. Just pay $130!! And PLEASE DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT SHIPPING CHARGE, AS THAT IS HOW MUCH IT REALLY COSTS(or more) DUE TO VERY HEAVY WEIGHT AS SOME OTHER SELLER EVEN COST MORE FROM JAPAN. BESIDES THE VERY EXPENSIVE EBAY FINAL VALUE FEE & PAYPAL FEE\u2019S, EBAY NOW CHARGES FINAL VALUE FEE ON SHIPPING CHARGE TOO. THE SHIPPING COST IS WRITTEN CLEARLY ON THE EMS ADDRESS LABEL IN JAPANESE YEN, SO THE BUYER WILL SEE THE ACTUAL COST OF SHIPPING.I DO NOT MAKE PROFIT OF SHIPPING!!! IMPORTANT NOTE: 1.
