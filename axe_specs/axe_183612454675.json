{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a used (early 2000's) Greg Bennett Fastback from Samick Guitar, in very good condition. I brushed and cleaned the fret board and frets, restrung with D'Addario 10's, and it's set for med\\low action. All electronics work as they should. The 3 way toggle on the end of the pick up switch is missing, but the switch still works fine (see pic.). It's a solid mahogany body, with a really nice quilted top, finished in a sharp blue\\green turquoise with a nice cream binding around the edge. There are no noticeable dings, dents or deep scratches of any kind.There is one noticeable small scuff into the finish on the upper bout near the p\\u switch. The maple neck and fret board are beautiful. Just look at the pics. And the head stock is gorgeous. Comes with Grover tuners too. These nice guitars were modeled after the very popular EVH's. Have a look at gregbennettguirars.com and go to the vault to learn more! All set up and playing nicely! Shipping is to Canada and the lower 48 U.S. only. Please ask any questions before you bid. Thanks and Happy New Year!", "ItemID": "183612454675", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T21:41:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T21:41:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samick-Greg-Bennett-Fastback-FB1-Electric-Guitar-Quilted-Top-Very-Nice-/183612454675", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Whitby, Ontario", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836124546758080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/KkMAAOSwkQhcKRqW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/lu8AAOSworNcKRq1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/JYYAAOSwZKlcKRrK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/MAYAAOSwWN5cKRrV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/uI0AAOSwx-lcKRr2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7UIAAOSwWk5cKRsI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/A9MAAOSwvERcKRrj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/wy4AAOSwZ4RcKRtV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/V10AAOSwkFZcKRtj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/~m0AAOSwPrdcKRt1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/HQ0AAOSw0~pcKRuL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/VngAAOSwKtlcKRuS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "L1N 7K9", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "romacpherso_5", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 112.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 148.5, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 265}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Samick \"Greg Bennett\" Fastback FB1 Electric Guitar Quilted Top - Very Nice.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Samick"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut"]}]}, "HitCount": 530, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 151.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
