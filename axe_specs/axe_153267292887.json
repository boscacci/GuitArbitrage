{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "These are pretty cool little guitars for the money. This one is in pretty good condition, I looked it over really well and the only thing I'd note is that the neck plate and the tops of the control knobs look to have a little tarnish on them. I've actually noticed some other Squier Classic Vibe Duo Sonics for sale on eBay that have the same sort of tarnish, it makes me wonder if a batch of these didn't get shipped this way. The chrome on the tuners and bridge looks brand new so it's kind of weird. You might even be able to polish the tarnish off but I've never tried. I can't find any other issues, it looks good to me otherwise. If you take a close look at the pictures above you'll notice that the neck is almost quartersawn which is a very nice factory accident I think, especially on a guitar in this price range. If you don't know about quartersawn necks, look it up. It's usually a feature reserved for more high end guitars. Right now I've got the action set kind of low, be aware you might need to make adjustments to suite your playing style if lower action isn't your thing. I think it sounds gnarly the way it is but if you play more blues/rock type stuff you might not dig it. Comes with a Guardian gigbag in good condition. From a smoke and pet free home. Bidders with zero or low feedback need to contact me before bidding or your bid will be cancelled. I'll only ship USPS insured to the lower 48 states.***Also note*** because of my schedule I may not be able to get the item shipped until the following Saturday after the auction ends. You'll notice I've got 5 days of handling time on the auction and this is why. I'll try to get it shipped earlier if I can but I can't make any promises. If you have any questions please ask before bidding!
