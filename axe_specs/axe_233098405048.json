{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Genuine FENDER TELECASTER MADE IN JAPAN Very Good/Exc Condition Butterscotch!!. Condition is Used. I am selling my personal Telecaster since I am now playing bass guitar in our group and unfortunately just don't play this guitar as muchas it should be played.. It has a very smooth action and as you may know, you can tell a lot about how an electric guitar will sound by what you hear playing it unplugged. This guitar unplugged rings like a bell, and sounds just as fine plugged in. Cool skunk stripe too.There is a small ding on the back lower corner (see picture) and a couple very small scratches too small to photograph.From a non-smoker household. Comes with a gig bag that is non-fender but in great shape.", "ItemID": "233098405048", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T23:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-18T23:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Genuine-FENDER-TELECASTER-MADE-JAPAN-Very-Good-Exc-Condition-Butterscotch-/233098405048", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Middlebury, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330984050488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NTU=/z/3ioAAOSwFZZcQJgo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OysAAOSwJvVcQJbi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pbUAAOSwZKlcQJbW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H9EAAOSw76lcQJho/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jWoAAOSwKV9cQJbV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HsMAAOSwiudcQJbI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5Nzc=/z/FqUAAOSwvpVcQJf3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "46540", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pascal909", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 275, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 431.6, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 431.6, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3704}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Genuine FENDER TELECASTER MADE IN JAPAN\u00a0 Very Good/Exc Condition Butterscotch!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Butterscotch"]}]}, "HitCount": 471, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 436.6, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
