This highly sought after rare guitar is simply stunning to say the least, right down to the vintage tones that screams with tonal versatility. If you have never played a vintage Gibson, you have not heard AMAZING !!! The super rare 3 Pickups are factory original with only a limited number made and I think by special order. This guitar is 100% Original with NO BREAKS or REPAIRS and weighs according to my digital scales is 10.68 pounds. The front of the body is in an exceptionally clean condition with some tarnish on the gold hardware. The back of the body does have some very light surface superficial marks but nothing nasty as this guitar has been well looked after and clean throughout. The neck is more a 60\u2019s thin style and not chunky like the 50\u2019s making fast and easy playing. The original frets look hardly broken in with plenty of life left in them. This guitar has aged beautifully with tons of character, stunning looks and an awesome sound to match. Included in this listing is the original Gibson case as pictured in excellent, clean condition. We all know the prices of 1970\u2019s Gibson are climbing through the roof, so don\u2019t miss your chance to own this Classic Vintage while they are still affordable!!!
