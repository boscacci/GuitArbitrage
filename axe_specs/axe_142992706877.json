{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a Washburn Dime 333 Dimebag Darrel Signature Model electric guitar with it's original hardshell case and three tremolo bars and one hex key. The guitar itself works 100 percent and is almost mint except for the chip were the neck connects to the body and there are some light chips here and there on the body and paint but not at all bad. Neck is straight and there have been no repairs done to the guitar. Brand new Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings added. I don't know what happened to this but there is also a hairline crack going through the middle and it goes into the wood. I'm not sure how far it goes through but it does goes through quite a bit but the guitar is still solid. The bottom half of the body does not have a crack. It is missing the selector switch knob that screws on. everything is original to the guitar. There are three different styles of tremolo bars each with there own bend and they are in good condition except for some spots that had surface rust on them and I cleaned them. The guitar itself sounds great. The pickups sound almost like PAF pickups and this guitar has a really great distortion and clean sound. The action is low with minimum string buzz at the lowest string(could maybe be set lower). The serial number is S5097297 and I believe this is a 1997 model. The case is in very good condition. The inside is mint but the outside has some scratches and light bruises. There is no key for it. Below are the specifications.
