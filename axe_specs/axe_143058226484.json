{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello. My name is Jerry and I am a guitar-aholic. I never played a guitar I didn't want to take home. My compulsion is to shop in the best guitar stores and internet guitar sites I have traveled out of state just to guitar shop and spent hours on the internet looking for just the right guitar\u2026just the right deal. It must have been a conquest thing because after I bought them, I typically placed them in the case and stacked them in the guitar room thinking one day I would need that guitar. I have acquired over 50 guitars mostly Gibson, Fender. It was a great ride, but it\u2019s over. When I turned 67 last year I decided to retire. I am too old to keep chasing these young guitars so I have decided to help them find new homes. I have about a dozen guitars that I am keeping because they remind me of the old days and the old bands. The rest are up for sale. Some of the guitars I will be selling are like right out of the box and right in to my guitar-room new. Others I bought to upgrade and play.This guitar is a rare blonde natural flame maple veneer top. I paid $799 new and I am going to offer it for $750. I have been collecting the Fender Aerodyne Stratocasters made in Japan. This series commissioned by Fender USA and sold in US before 2010 had basswood bodies and maple tops. The MIJ pick ups are hotter than US models and the fret board is 7.5. My experience is when you pair this guitar with a Seymour Duncan Hot Rails in the bridge position you get increased volume and sustain. The combination of the basswood and maple with the hot pick up makes this a killer lead guitar. Or you can keep the stock single coil and use a TS9 foot pedal for even more variety. The Areodyne has all the spank and quack of the US Fenders but the craftsmanship is IMO, improved. The pick up covers only were changed but the rest of the guitar is totally stock including the actual pick ups. I had 7 Aerodynes so each was played very little.The guitar will be shipped via FedEX in a musical instrument box. No case is provided. There are several Fender Aerodyne guitars being sold from Japan that are 3/4 size. This is a full size Stratocaster. Look at the pictures. Ask any questions. No refunds. No international bidders, please. Will ship Fed EX to US (48 states) destinations only. Please use PayPal.
