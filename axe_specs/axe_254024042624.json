I was shooting a lot of photos. Please confirm with a photograph. It was manufactured in 1980. It was made 38 years ago. This is a very old YAMAHA Les Paul type. Although it is an old guitar, It keeps very good++ condition.. I want to boast of the high quality wood of old Japanese guitar. Please look at the Maple wood top. This Plane Top is very beautiful. You can see the birds eyes maple wood top by view angle. I sold a lot of the electric guitars in eBay. And I always feel so. Vintage Greco and vintage Aria proII and vintage Epiphone japan are very similar. Vintage Tokai and vintage Burny are very similar. However, I feel Yamaha is not similar to any brand. YAMAHA is characteristic. And I always think about the all old YAMAHA. I think the quality of wood is high anyway. It can consistently say to the old YAMAHA. That can be said for low price SL-380 too. High quality wood is used for this SL-500. I think that you can understand immediately. Making is polite anyway. Sufficient noise countermeasure are given. I think old Yamaha does not care about the cost. There are various reasons for that. Many dielectric paint etc. If you get it, please confirm with your eyes. Current, Some High end model guitars are made in Japan, but others are produced in Yamaha's own factory in China. It may be the cause, but currently in Japan, Yamaha's electric guitar is not popular. This is a Yamaha guitar of a very popular era. Produced by Kasuga musical instrument manufacture. Kasuga musical instrument manufacture was producing acoustic guitar, banjo, violin. Representative brands are \"Heerby\" \"ELECTRA\" \"Gaban\" \"Ganson\" \"RK Herby\" \"The KASUGA\" etc. Currently, it is all evaluated as Japan Vintage. This SL500 has dignity of vintage guitar. About guitar play, Current state, the space between the strings and the frets is standard. The accuracy of the product is high. Therefore Un pluged sound is very powerful. You can feel vibrations transmitted to the body. I like this YAMAHA L-II pickups. I feel the very good distortion sound. I recommend for Heavy Metal music or Hard Rock music !! Of course, Clean sound is very well. Old YAMAHA is Great !! It is cleanliness. I polished with guitar exclusive polish, so it is in a very clean state. I after the finger board cleaning, painted beeswax. The aim is moisturizing and and protection. Current neck condition, very good ! roughly straight ! Truss rod can be turned a little clockwise, but it is stiff. I think the limit is close. Remaining the frets are 83% on average. You can play immediately after it is delivered to you. I was set new strings. Regular tuning. ( Inch : 009, 011, 016, 024, 032, 042 ) All is working well. It is in a very good condition. The Truss rod Wrench is not included.
