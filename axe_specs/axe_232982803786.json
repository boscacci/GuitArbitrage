{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is an awesome iteration of a CLASSIC Gretsch 6120SSU Setzer. TV Jones pickups relly pop and range from a jangly rockabilly twang to a fat, buttery rock tone. Bigsby bar is set up true and the tuning and intonation is rock solid. Locking tuners are another premium appointment and the wood is a beautifully figured Gretsch orange although the pictures may appear a little more reddish than the actual classic Gretsch orange. The guitar has been lightly gigged and was \"plec'd\" by SF Guitar Works meaning the set up is professional and the guitar plays beautifully and true up the neck. PRICED TO SELL! The original truss rod cover and pickguard have been swapped out: the truss rod cover for a custom version with my band name \"Califuegos,\" the pickguard for a more simple black Gretsch version. Both the original pickguard with the Setzer autograph and the Gretsch TR cover are included as well as dice knobs. Gretsch case is in good condition with some marking on front. Please note: I consider this guitar as \"good\" to \"very good\" condition and she will clean up beautifully. If you're looking for \"mint\" this guitar is not for you. She is however, a beautiful \"player.\" I've done my best to represent condition in photos. I really hate to see her go but have to finance next gear acquisition! Any questions, please ask before bidding on this guitar. If you are susceptible to buyer's remorse, PLEASE do not bid. Also please do not bid if you have \"O feedback.\" Shipping charge will be exactly my cost plus professional packing with insurance. Shipping to continental US only. Local pick up in or near San Francisco is possible. Good luck bidding!On Oct-30-18 at 07:38:07 PDT, seller added the following information: Manufacture date is 2004.", "ItemID": "232982803786", "EndTime": "2018-10-30T21:12:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-27T21:12:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gretsch-G6120SSU-Brian-Setzer-Nashville-Hollowbody-Guitar-Tiger-Flame-Orange-/232982803786", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Montara, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2329828037868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HOAAAOSwRhFb1NDG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RykAAOSw2-pb1NDF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/gFIAAOSw5atb1NDK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwM1gxNTk5/z/QoEAAOSwzhZb1NIS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JnoAAOSwEKpb1NDK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0-0AAOSw~29b1NDL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WioAAOSwDP1b1NIT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDI0/z/5ToAAOSwQIFb1NKD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qRsAAOSwqOFb1NC9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTE0/z/8EUAAOSw6Pxb1NDJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODIyWDE2MDA=/z/TyUAAOSwl95b1NDD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-tMAAOSwl3xb1NJu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94037", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wiez1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 183, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 862}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CO", "PA", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gretsch G6120SSU Brian Setzer Nashville Hollowbody Guitar Tiger Flame Orange", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch Guitars"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["2400117822"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["<b>Body<CRLF></b>Body shape: Single cutaway<CRLF>Body type: Hollo", "volume 1", "volume 2<CRLF>Pickup switch: 3-way<CRLF>Coil tap or split: No<CRL"]}]}, "HitCount": 328, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
