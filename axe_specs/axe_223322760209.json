{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Cleaning out some music gear and this is one of my guitars. This is a Washburn RS-10V with the case that I bought it in. All original parts, burrrel maple top on a mahogany body, EMG pickups, Washburn 600T tremolo with the trem bar, abalone dots on a set neck. This guitar was used on the regular and sat in the studio until about five years ago. Then kept in a controlled environment. It does have the bumps and dink\u2019s scratches, swirl marks and wear that are expected from a 20+ year old guitar. Some that break the paint and there is a finish stress crack at the bottom back of the set neck. The truss rod cover is not attached but is in the case pocket (you will need some screws to attach it) I plugged it in and and it sounded great, all the electronics work as intended and the neck plays great. Please use the pictures for part of the description, enlarge them, blow them up, take a good look. That being said, this is a used item in working condition sold as is, this item may take some knowledge, work and love to make it fit your playing style, no guarantee is given or implied, I will only ship to the lower 48 states, and I will ship promptly.
