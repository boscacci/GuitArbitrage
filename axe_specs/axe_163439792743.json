{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This a really nice MIJ Lawsuit Precision Telecaster that my friend had sitting in his closest for years. Hasn't been used for some time but works just fine. Like all older vintage instruments it could use some tweaking/adjusting to suit your needs and taste as well as new strings, but that's up to you. Japanese knock-offs like these were made in the 1970's to compete with the American made Fender basses. This is 33\" medium scale bass with a beautifully clean and straight neck. Tuners work great and has a beautiful buttery yellow color with just the right amount of vintage ware that is all original. All in all this is great looking/sounding bass. As with any instrument sound is subjective as to what you like, but I find these old vintage MIJ basses to have plenty of oomph and a unique sweetness. These are pretty hard to find and rarely come up for auction. Please ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer them. Comes with soft case. CONUSA bidders and mailing only. Paypal only. Will mail out within one work day after receiving payment. Thanks for looking.", "ItemID": "163439792743", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T04:48:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T04:48:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-70s-Lawsuit-Telecaster-Bass-Made-Japan-/163439792743", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Moscow, Idaho", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634397927438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lRwAAOSw~D5cF-ev/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sg0AAOSwF1tcF-fW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rykAAOSwJFhcF-f8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VoUAAOSwg-tcF-gR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J3MAAOSwVYhcF-gh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LmQAAOSwH1pcF-gx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f4kAAOSwDFZcF-hi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I~sAAOSwgyZcF-ie/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZS8AAOSwC85cF-hz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KtYAAOSwaPNcF-iJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QVQAAOSwDaBcF-i6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TPYAAOSwdhdcF-jL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "83843", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "surfrocker60", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 462, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2498}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 70's Lawsuit Telecaster Bass-Made In Japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["precision telecaster"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["70's telecaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Yellow"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1970's"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Medium scale"]}]}, "HitCount": 273, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 127.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Has typical scratches and ware marks.
