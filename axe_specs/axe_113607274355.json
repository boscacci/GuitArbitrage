G-400 The Epiphone G-400 is truly one of the best guitar values you will find today. Every serious player wants an SG and here's the real thing that sounds as good as it looks. The original SG not only rivaled guitars of its own era for sonic variety but also proved to be a sign of things to come. Hard rock, metal and scores of rockers embraced the original SG and made it a classic. Now, the G-400 gives you the sound and look of a real SG without the vintage price tag. The SG Story When the SG or \"Solid Guitar\" was introduced in 1961 as a replacement for the Les Paul, it was called the \"fretless wonder\" for its low frets and fast action. The twin horn cutaway design was like nothing on the market and its light but balanced weight made it the perfect guitar for stage and studio work. Later \u201860s models introduced the SG with humbucker pickups, and since then, the SG has become the go-to guitar for artists like The Who's Pete Townshend, Tony Iommi, Paul Weller, AC/DC's Angus Young, Eric Clapton and Derek Trucks of the Allman Brothers Band.
