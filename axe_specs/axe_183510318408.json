{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 2018 Gibson SG Special in the stunning \"Natural Satin\" finish \u2014 a sort of golden brown. Looks to be a one-piece body, with really nice woodgrain. I can't find a seam anywhere. Rare for Specials, I know. Light as a feather at 6 lbs. -deluxe tuners-Mini humbuckers-24 frets-retro control knobs-chrome hardware-premium padded leather gig bagI bought this guitar new a month ago, had it fret dressed by a real lutherie and thats how the nicks on the horn as photographed occurred. The fret dress was a success though. It plays great and I learned alot about guitar design from it. It sounds tremendous and with the right setup it crunches in a great way. There are zero neck issues. Other than the nicks on the left horn there are a few scratches on the back body, on the pickguard, and one between the bridge and tailpiece. No buckle rash as it has not left the house. This is a great guitar, it is setup great, and feels great but I have other non-guitar concerns (blasphemy I know) that take up my time now. It is setup with elixir 9s. Includes the leather bag which is surprisingly nice and useful. Includes original papers in the original plastic bag that these sell with.
