{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I'm letting go of my Jackson SLATXMG3-6 guitar! I purchased it back in May of this year and just haven't been able to use it as much as I would've liked to so I figured someone else could get more use out of it. I'll put the links to Musician's Friend down below for minute details. But it's in \"like new\" condition since there one minor ding that is shown in the pictures which was already there from the factory unfortunately. Great guitar, it does include the $80 Gator case that I purchased with it and I'll throw in a new pair of strings and the strap with it inside of the case. I would like to get $600 for it since the combined value is around $800 new. Feel free to email me for more details! https://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/jackson-slatxmg3-6-electric-guitar/j16730000001000 https://www.musiciansfriend.com/accessories/gator-gwe-elec-hardshell-electric-guitar-case/546207000001000", "ItemID": "401671223825", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T23:30:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T23:30:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-Slatxmg3-6-Guitar-w-Case-Sale-/401671223825", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Granite Falls, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/4016712238258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY3NQ==/z/UgYAAOSw4jxb4M8b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY3NQ==/z/YsoAAOSwJd1b4M8b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDEyMDA=/z/6LoAAOSwVYhb4M8c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY3NQ==/z/t5MAAOSwpFtb4M8b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY3NQ==/z/3hQAAOSwcQpb4M8c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDEyMDA=/z/LGcAAOSwG-xb4M8c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY3NQ==/z/R4UAAOSwQ25b4M8b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98252", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "traande_74", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": -1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 282.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 282.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 66}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson Slatxmg3-6 Guitar w/ Case for Sale!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["slattxmg3-6"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 77, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 287.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
