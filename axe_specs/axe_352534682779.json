{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is an interesting guitar. Aside from being in great shape and having very good tone, There is a \"window\" in time that this guitar seemingly doesn't exist in Ibanez archives. It could be one of those short-run one-offs for a particular retailer at the time. This is why I stated 2005-ish because that's the best I can narrow it down. Here's a link that shows the Korean made SA 220, but shows no body binding and plain dot inlays. Click below for specs and info Click HERE for link These are well made guitars for the price range and always have been. In the early 2000's, I had at least 4 SA160's and recorded 2 full albums with just them. This SA220 is more full bodied than the SA160's I had and performs better with chord voicings. Mahagony body with Flamed Maple top. Bolt on with tremolo that works surprisingly well. Comes with TG Tour Grade Gig Bag. I'm listing it now so it can be had for Christmas. Will ship Priority USPS within 24 hours.
