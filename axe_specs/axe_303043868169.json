{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FOR SALE, one 2017 Gibson Les Paul Classic, in exquisite condition for used. Gently played in my smoke-free home, never even gigged. It's beautiful with its cherry sunburst and you would be hard pressed to find any scratches. I nicknamed it \"Dimples\", due the nice refractive spots in the bookmatched top, adjacent to the either side of the bridge. Minimal fret wear. 60s slim taper neck, '57 Classic pickups which sound wonderful, and nickel hardware throughout. If you're looking for a great Les Paul minus the original new price, look no further. The original Gibson Speed Knobs have been changed out for some amber, 50s style top hats, but the originals will come with. Case is equally in fantastic shape. Comes with all the original case candy. Under CITES regulations, I can only sell to addresses in the USA, due to the rosewood fingerboard. It will ship, insured via UPS in a Gibson shipping box. Will sell to the highest bidder so please refrain from asks to end the auction early, what my minimum,is, trade offers, etc. Thanks for looking and happy bidding!
