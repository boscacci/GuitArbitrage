{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a Fender Toronado as pictured. All around great sounding and very playable guitar. All functions fully tested and all work as designed. Great player. Nice action. No cracks. No repairs. Please ask for more pictures if you want them. Signs of usage/age/patina as pictured. I tried to capture the signs of usage/blemishes - but very hard to do with a black guitar. Picture #4 shows the blemishes on the side of the guitar near the input jack. Pick guard shows previous play. Please ask questions for more details. Please ask all questions before placing a bid. What you see is what you get. Please, please ask all questions before bidding.

The answer is absolutely none, maybe just a bad picture.", "ItemID": "192733866764", "EndTime": "2018-11-29T23:49:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-22T23:49:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-BLACK-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-TORONADO-MEXICO-GIG-BAG-/192733866764", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927338667648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NzA=/z/MOEAAOSwdmlb5Lgj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/VLQAAOSw29Jb5Lgm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/aUIAAOSw0vJb5Lgn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/iOsAAOSwMg5b5Lgr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzU2/z/jLMAAOSwWXFb5Lgh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/-BIAAOSwi3xb5Lg0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/hpwAAOSwr5db5Lgy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Njg=/z/NawAAOSwDJZb5Lgf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/2VkAAOSw5Epb5Lgk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/3UMAAOSwRNtb5Lgu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/VLgAAOSw29Jb5Lgp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/VdIAAOSwRytb5Lgt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60630", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ajspedals", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2514, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 684.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 684.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 222}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER BLACK ELECTRIC GUITAR TORONADO MEXICO & GIG BAG", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["TORONADO"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 127, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 694.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "ALL ECTRONICS FULLY TESTED AND ALL WORK AS DESIGNED.
