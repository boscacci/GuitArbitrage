{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1968 Fender Telecaster w/ Original Case This '68 Fender Telecaster is from my Father's estate (Hank Summers) who was a musician and avid guitar collector. The guitar was refinished to Dakota Red sometime in the late 70's or early 80's. It has been in my father's collection since the mid 80's. He was fond of this guitar and used it in an album recorded at Stepridge studio in the late 90s. In the mid 2000's he also played this guitar in his Southwest band Cowboy Mafia. The guitar is currently setup for playing. It has been re-fretted, has performance saddles, and is equipped with a Bill Lawrence pickup (I was told). The original pickup and saddles come separately as pictured. The pots are original (pot code 6646) . The paint has mild chipping as displayed. The case is slightly worn, but in good shape for its age. The switch knob also came off and is displayed with the parts. The neck is dated Feb 1968, and it has serial numbers #236xxx on the back plate. I'm starting the bidding low and going to let the market determine the price. A stock one of these typically runs $6-8k. Get this player's guitar you can take up on stage and will still hold its value! Good luck picking up this great piece of history and adding to it!", "ItemID": "332898348388", "EndTime": "2018-12-03T06:00:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-23T06:00:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1968-Vintage-Fender-Telecaster-Original-case-New-Old-Hardware-Refinished-/332898348388", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328983483888080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HEIAAOSwRjxb916M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LOYAAOSwQ9lb916g/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Gm0AAOSwgVJb916k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xd4AAOSwsPNb92At/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WxQAAOSw0rdb916i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PicAAOSw6CRb92AH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eHEAAOSwe~lb916Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/23sAAOSwCvFb916W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D8MAAOSwUxlb916U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gfoAAOSwiwZb917d/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FPMAAOSwKwhb9195/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6hUAAOSwMhVb916P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "87505", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gregsum", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 58, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3549.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3549.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4227}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1968 Vintage Fender Telecaster - Original case - New + Old Hardware - Refinished", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry Red"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1968"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 648, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "118985", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118985", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 3599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
