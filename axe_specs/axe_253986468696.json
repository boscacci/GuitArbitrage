{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx, no PO Boxes.I will not ship anywhere else. Most deliveries will require a signature. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier Standard Series Stratocaster. The maple/rosewood 22 fret neck has near zero fret wear .The very cool Dark Red Sunburst Body looks very nice but has damage to the finish on the upper horn at the strap button , a small ping on the back, and light surface scratches. I don't know what caused this damage as it was like this when I got the guitar. The strap button feels secure and if you play with a strap it will cover most of the damage. Guitar features a white pearloid pickguard and the stock Squier Standard Series Alnico pickups. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. Because of the finish damage I'm listing this one for $50.00 less than I normally would. Action is very good and guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
