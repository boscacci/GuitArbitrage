{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Reverend Guitars - Matt West Signature Electric This Reverend Matt West signature is in great condition. Serial number - 29188, weight - 7.53 lbs Guitars and artist Matt West came together to create a guitar that can truly fly - much like West's playing. Designed for simplicity with a single Reverend 9A5 pickup, this guitar won't weigh you down. Get those aggressive, percussive, raw tones with less fuss, and use the Wilkinson tremolo for a great dive-bomb. The guitar has many true-to-Reverend features, such as a solid korina body, medium oval neck profile, pin-lock tuners, and a bass contour knob. However, it also boasts some unique characteristics - such as the reverse headstock with Matt's \"wizard\" logo. Please note: This guitar does NOT have a roasted maple neck.
