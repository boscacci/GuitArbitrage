The Wolfgang Special features a basswood body with an arched top and a robust graphite-reinforced bolt-on quartersawn maple neck, carved and rolled to Eddie Van Halens exacting specifications and with a hand-rubbed urethane back finish. Primed for high performance, energetic riffing and blazing leads, its 12-16 compound radius ebony fingerboard has 22 jumbo frets and pearloid dot inlays. Truss rod adjustments have also never been easier thanks to a spoke wheel conveniently located at the base of the neck. A pair of flagship custom designed EVH Wolfgang Alnico 2 humbucking pickups are mounted directly to the body, providing dynamic yet articulate voicing, as well as endless sustain for powerful chords and melody lines. A sturdy and dependable EVH-branded Floyd Rose locking trem and Floyd Rose locking nut work in tandem for precise tuning even with extreme changes in pitch, while the EVH D-Tuna retunes to drop-D and back with strict accuracy at the flick of a finger, with a low-friction volume control for smooth swells and a high-friction tone control that prevents accidental tone shifting. Spotlight-ready, the Wolfgang Special is offered in a handful of eye-catching finishes with matching headstocks, attractive single-ply body binding and black or chrome hardware.
