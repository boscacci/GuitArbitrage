{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "PLEASE, Read the ENTIRE auction! Extremely Good Condition - Near perfect, played very little, I know there is 1 straight line scratch on the body but I can't find it. Sounds great, plays great. Play as is or set up to taste. Hate to let it go but I'm getting married. It has the baritone nob, pick-up and phase etc. switches. It is a 9.5+ out of 10 and the BC Rich fitted case is a 9 of 10. GREAT Guitar. I was just informed by another eBayer that this is the ST Q model and that stands for the fixed bridge. He told me that makes this more valuable, so last time listed. Also, I had to change the shipping as I just shipped a guitar that cost $65 to ship it insured. Thanks! Returns only for gross misrepresentations.
