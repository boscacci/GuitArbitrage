{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I purchased this guitar in Japan. I had the pick of the litter. There were prettier guitars but none that played nicer or better. There are tiny scratches on the back, and a couple slight dings on the front (PLEASE LOOK AT THE PICTURES) but nothing is bad. This guitar plays like a real '59 Les Paul and can be sweet and can be growly with the turn of a volume knob. If you know Tokai guitars, you know the Hibiki models were contracted to get as close to an orignial '59 Les Paul as possible. Tokai spared no expense pursuing this goal. This guitar is as good as any modern 59 Les Paul you can name. Weighs just a hair under 9 pounds according to my scale.

Changing the neck angle, and the angle of bridge, sustain is also improved. By changing slightly pickup at bridge, at front pickups and neck gap narrows between the bridge and the bridge, making closer to vintage Les Paul specifications; And jacaranda (Brazilian rosewood) is also what to say now is very valuable and useful finger plate, change to the Delrin nut nut. Choice was rock hard maple body top material. More than trace limit raised to these are all vintage Les Paul, design and manufacturing is no exaggeration to say exactly original Les Paul sound revived in modern times, has been!
