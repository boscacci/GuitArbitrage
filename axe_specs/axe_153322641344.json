{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "FREE SHIPPING.AUCTION and SHIPPING available to only US 48 States. Good as new. Single owner, light use in home only over two years. No visible dings, just light pick swirls and some shirt button surface scratches on the back, which aren't visible from more than a few inches away. Anything that looks like a scratch in the photos is just reflection. The Duncan Seth Lover pickups. If you want this model, this is the one to buy. No point in buying a new one with this one available. The Eastman guitar case is included, and it's also in excellent condition. (I replaced the witch hat tone knobs recently, as those were the only thing that showed any sign of use. One of the originals didn't want to come off, so I didn't force it. Since they are all amber, the old and new are a close match. The 4th new one will be in the case, and if you want to replace it applying a little more force than I did, its there for you.). SALE and Shipping CONDITIONS: SHIPS TO US 48 States Only. Shipping will be by ground UPS or Fedex, whichever is cheaper. Payment by Paypal only. If you have less than 5 ebay transactions, or less than 97.5% favorable rating, I'm sorry, but I won't sell to you. I apologize in advance for that. The shipping of an instrument of this caliber presents enough challenges, and I prefer not to add another level of uncertainty to it with a buyer without a long and established ebay history.", "ItemID": "153322641344", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T10:48:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T18:41:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Eastman-T-186MX-Thinline-Semi-Hollow-Electric-Guitar-hardshell-case-/153322641344", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Jacksonville, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533226413448080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDU0/z/mGoAAOSwLNxcKQg8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NDQ=/z/V5QAAOSw91JcKQhY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTc3/z/REsAAOSwi6dcKQho/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjE5/z/xYoAAOSwjfdcKQhw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDQw/z/EFYAAOSwn01cKQh8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NjY=/z/Mv8AAOSwqxdcKQiH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3ODQ=/z/6kAAAOSwa~FcKQiP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dV0AAOSwQqNcKQir/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDcy/z/wc8AAOSwxtVcKQi4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUzNlgxNjAw/z/-D8AAOSwjfpcKQjr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQz/z/LHQAAOSwVNNcKQke/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzMzWDE2MDA=/z/Ky8AAOSwgcdcKQkt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32258", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mrreliable88", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 70, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***6", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 80}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Eastman T 186MX Thinline Semi Hollow Electric Guitar with hardshell case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Eastman"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 235, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
