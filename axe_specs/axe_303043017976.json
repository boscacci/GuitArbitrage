{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "When the Prophecy Series was first introduced in 2008, it was hailed by metal players the world over as the ultimate combination of tradition and innovation and the perfect guitar for serious shredding, all within the stylish lines of the classic Les Paul form. If you are a rock, metal, thrash, or neo classical player, you will love the speed of the neck and the additional 2 frets that a traditional Les Paul dosen't have. The full two octaves adds a new dimension to your playing. The EMG pickups are great for recording and performance because they add that extra bite to your solos and heavy chords. There are no finish flaws dents or deep scratches - just some polish swirls (anything else you might see is likely a reflection) as finish and guitar are near perfect. Includes OEM Hardshell Case and Case Candy (owners manual, poster, case lock key, truss rod allen wrench, and two strap locks) as shown. Missing plastic pickup selector cap (as pictured) is in the OEM hardshell case (with case candy included as shown).
