{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Free FedEx Shipping!Check out the 12 clear close-up super-size pictures to help describe this nice item.Up for ~buy it now~ or ~best offer~ is one vintage 1993 Jackson electric guitar, model JDR-94. It has the Floyd Rose Tremolo with screw-on arm, and micro tuners too. 5 way pickup selector switch and 3 powerful pickups, two humbuckers and one single/strat style. The serial number is 9304336 dating the guitar at 1993.24 fret two octave neck with reverse headstock. I really like the double dot fret markers, very classy! Nice quality tuning keys, locking nut. All the electronics work fine. It does have it's share of player use, scratches, chips in the finish etc on the gloss black finish. You can see the biggest chip right below the 5 way switch on the front bottom edge. Original owner built a clear plate on the back for the pots cavity.My only recommendation to the new owner of this guitar is you should know about setting up a Floyd rose bridge. I have it set up pretty close but I know it could be dialed in better, I just don't know how to do that. It does not come with a Jackson guitar case but I'll be shipping it in the chip case shown in pic #12. It will definitely help protect it and I'll use a FedEx \"guitar box\" to ship it in with plenty of bubble wrap and protection around it so it arrives safely to you.I just saw one of these JDR-94's sell for $470 but I'm starting this at under $250, and with free shipping!
