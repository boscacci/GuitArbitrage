{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ibanez GIO Series GSR205SM Electric Bass Guitar, 5 String SHOWS NORMAL WEAR, FUNCTIONAL with some issues CONDITION: Used electric bass guitar in an average pre-owned condition. One of the tune knobs (marked with a red tape cross) doesn't work - it spins not properly and makes no effect on the sound except some cracking. The body of the guitar has a tolerable amount of dents and scuffs from regular use, mostly on the back of the guitar. The volume knob works but gets very tight somewhere in the middle of the round. Can't call it fully functional but it's still operable. It might be out of tune when we ship it. The guitar comes with a hardshell case and some cables from the previous owner.
