{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Paul Reed Smith Standard. Black. 2015. Made in USA. Original heavily padded PRS gig bag. Everything works well. No issues whatsoever. Very good to excellent condition.No dings, pucks, buckle rash... Guitar has been cared for. Some slight pick scratches on the pickguard. It's been played. I've set the opening bid at the absolute lowest I'll accept. If only one person bids then that bid wins, but the Buy It Now price is a bargain. For sale within the continental USA only. NO RETURNS. I've described the item as accurately as possible and provided a number of photos from different angles. I'm a private person, not a shop or anything. These are my personal items.Check my feedback and know you can bid with confidence. Please write with any questions. I'll try my best to answer them.I've guessed the shipping based on experience. If it is less than I've charged for shipping + insurance, I'll refund the difference. The shipping is used to cover the costs. That's all. Thank you for looking.", "ItemID": "202485160159", "EndTime": "2018-11-05T14:08:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T14:08:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-S2-Standard-PRS-2015-Black-All-original-padded-gig-bag-Made-USA-/202485160159", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Greenville, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2024851601598080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/NhMAAOSwKA5b1xOO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/aPgAAOSw5atb1xOX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/dcMAAOSwVRBb1xOh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/99IAAOSw1M9b1xOn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/~LwAAOSwoZlb1xOw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/cdIAAOSw9z1b1xO4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/BngAAOSwz5Nb1xPD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/SCQAAOSwsRVb1xPL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/vcwAAOSwN5hb1xPS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "27858", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "onthecushion", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 708, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 498.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 498.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 61}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith S2 Standard PRS 2015 Black All original padded gig bag Made USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 257, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 503.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
