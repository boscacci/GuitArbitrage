{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Back in 2016, Brian \"Head\" Welch of Korn released a book titled \"Eyes Wide Open\". He held a twitter contest as a promo for the book, and only 20 of these guitars were ever made (see the screenshot in the photos where they advertised the contest on twitter). They were Ibanez \"Gio\" model 7-string guitars, and his company had a custom shop put the art overlay onto the guitars, and then he autographed them. I was lucky enough to win one of these guitars. Why am I selling it? First, I have too many guitars, and I don't every play this one. Second, my wife is going back to college and I need the cash. Third, there are probably Korn or Brian \"Head\" Welch fans that would enjoy this 7-string a lot more than I would. The box that it is laying on top of in some of the photos is that box that it was shipped to me in. I will ship it to you in that same box. I've played this guitar about once, MAYBE twice since I've had it (since 2016). It's basically a brand new guitar. Happy bidding! I'm not sure how much the shipping will be, but in my experience it's usually about $85 to $150 for big boxes like this. I'm charging $100 and anything over that, I'll cover. I don't know what service I will use, but it will be either USPS, UPS, or FedEx ground.", "ItemID": "292821835066", "EndTime": "2018-11-28T00:58:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-18T00:58:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Gio-7-string-autographed-Brian-Head-Welch-Korn-custom-guitar-/292821835066", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pineville, Louisiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928218350668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0b8AAOSw1Tdb8K7r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nysAAOSwtaBb8K7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j-0AAOSwgSpb8K7s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iTwAAOSwqKNb8K7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Zn4AAOSwCXFb8K7q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ry4AAOSw87lb8K7s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njg3WDE2MDA=/z/tX4AAOSw6Pxb8K7r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/peEAAOSwxG9b8K7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cWUAAOSwXi9b8K7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTY5/z/BkEAAOSwztVb8LMm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fb8AAOSw1KRb8LM0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SBsAAOSwujJb8K7r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "71360", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "starbuck2907", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 80, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 921}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Gio 7-string autographed by Brian \"Head\" Welch of Korn custom guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}]}, "HitCount": 174, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
