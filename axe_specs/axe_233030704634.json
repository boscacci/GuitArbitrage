{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a Beautiful sounding, looking, and playing Ernie Ball MusicMan Silhouette Electric Guitar - Made in USA. Comes with hard shell case. It recently went through a perfect setup at Trutone Music in Santa Monica, CA. Action is low and smooth. Neck is perfectly straight. Frets are in great shape. Here is some info based on the serial number straight from a MusicMan rep. This Silhouette HSS was built on September 15th, 1992. The color is Black with the Rosewood fretboard. It was originally shipped to Al's Music. I'm mainly a bass player, so I only used this guitar for recording at home. Never left the house for a gig. Smoke free home. Baby on the way so I'm trying to make some room by selling some gear. Sounds like a Fender Strat HSS, but more comfortable. Shipping to Lower 48 USA States only. If you are outside that region and really want this guitar, then please contact me before bidding so we can arrange shipping. Thank you,", "ItemID": "233030704634", "EndTime": "2018-12-10T00:21:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T00:21:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-1992-Ernie-Ball-Musicman-Silhouette-Electirc-Guitar-/233030704634", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Venice, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330307046348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/BKEAAOSwd7FcBHPM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/JGUAAOSw0YlcBHPP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/vmQAAOSw7OdcBHPS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/LmgAAOSwO-pcBHPV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/PmYAAOSwEUdcBHPZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/BWQAAOSwIsdcBHPc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90291", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thicksound", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 143, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 660.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 660.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2854}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "VINTAGE 1992 - Ernie Ball Musicman Silhouette Electirc Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Music Man"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1992"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["silhouette"]}]}, "HitCount": 290, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 670.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
