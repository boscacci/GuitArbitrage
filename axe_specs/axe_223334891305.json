{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "VANTAGE \"The Entertainer\" Les Paul W/ Case. - Japan This is a early 80's model (Only made between 80-83, I believe) Made in Japan and is a great quality Guitar. Really nice shape. Has some small scratches but nothing bad at all. This is not \"MINT\" but really nice. Please excuse my photography skills, Most all of the imperfections are from glare and not damage. This baby really shines :) Mostly original but has some parts replaced such as Tone Pro Tuners (no extra holes were drilled) Truss rod cover and bridge. These are pretty rare and seldom sold. Had a recent setup and looks and plays awesome! Very cool Guitar Comes with Hardshell case. Please review all pics and ask any questions before buying. I accept returns but you will have to pay postage both ways. Shipping fixed at $48 to the lower 48.", "ItemID": "223334891305", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T02:28:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T14:26:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/VANTAGE-Entertainer-Les-Paul-Semi-Hollow-Body-Guitar-W-Case-Japan-/223334891305", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Swartz Creek, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233348913058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g60AAOSwa3lcRILM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/130AAOSwJvVcRILP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YcwAAOSwcGpcRILU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZHcAAOSwlZ1cRILb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Zh4AAOSws6dcRILf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1O0AAOSw3K1cRILk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/N5MAAOSwd0pcRILs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9QMAAOSwLnRcRILz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VpQAAOSw0ylcRIL2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "48473", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stratman33_99", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1519, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 960}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "VANTAGE \" The Entertainer\" Les Paul Semi Hollow Body Guitar W/ Case. - Japan -", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Vantage"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 61, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good used shape", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
