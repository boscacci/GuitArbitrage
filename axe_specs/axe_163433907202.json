{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This auction is for a Bowden Green Yamaha Revstar. I've owned the guitar for approx 2 years and I've done nothing to it but play it. The guitar is in what I would call excellent condition but obviously that's subjective and some people are more picky than others when it comes to condition so feel free to ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer them for you. Everything works as it should on the guitar. The original Yamaha gig bag is included. I will listen to reasonable offers for buy it now. I'm going to take more pics of the guitar to try to show more detail but if you have any specific parts of the guitar you'd like to see just let me know and I'll get you a pic.", "ItemID": "163433907202", "EndTime": "2018-12-22T23:18:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-15T23:18:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Yamaha-Revstar-RS502t-electric-guitar-Bowden-Green-/163433907202", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634339072028080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1ODA=/z/Du0AAOSwAmJcFYgs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5OTY=/z/9KoAAOSwXMxcFYhZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk4WDE2MDA=/z/NqsAAOSwiwZcFYhr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NDY=/z/e1cAAOSw5wFcFYiH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MjA=/z/2yoAAOSwPrdcFYia/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "46227", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "roscothunder", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 291, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 38, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 385.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 385.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 240}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Yamaha Revstar RS502t electric guitar Bowden Green", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Yamaha"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Bowden Green"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Yamaha Revstar"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}]}, "HitCount": 310, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 390.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The guitar is in very good condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
