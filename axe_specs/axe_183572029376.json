I have plugged this guitar in and played it, overall it plays and functions great, switches and knobs work well, machine heads and tuning are sturdy signal was pretty clear but it did sound like the 9V battery within was running low so you may wish to change it. Cosmetically the guitar has wear like surface scratches, scuffs, there is also a chip on one of the edges. The pickups also look as though they are slightly discoloured, also the strap lock on the top of the body is incomplete and not working, strap is included but the locks will need fixing/replacing. Overall this guitar is completely playable the way it is, it comes as a bare instrument as it is shown in the attached photos.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
