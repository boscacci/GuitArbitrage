{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Extremely Rare Red Ibanez 2387DX set neck Flying V. Clean with case! I cannot emphasize how extremely rare these setneck cherry red Flying V\u2019s are! They come up for sale on eBay maybe once every five years at most! The Korina V and Destroyer copies come up hundreds of times a year in comparison. THIS IS NOT A BOLT-ON NECK!! MIJ\u00a0IN Summer of 1975. Pickups date the guitar to July of 75. This is a pre-serial lawsuit copy. ALL ORIGINAL ELECTRONICS INCLUDING PAF STYLE SUPER 70 PICKUPS THAT SOUND KILLER!!\u00a0 They are pre September of 1975, so they are not inscribed \u201cSuper 70\u201d, but have the typical Ibanez / Fujigen date stamp. They have a perfect output of 7.95 ohms~ There are a few nicks on the edge of body and one on the top of the body that I point out in the pictures, all of which were lightly touched up. All of these are pictured and are very minor! Nothing through the finish as this guitar was always well cared for. This is a very nice playing, feeling and sounding vintage guitar. The original frets are near full thickness and there are only a few very minor indentations from the strings that are also pictured. Very very minor! The truss rod functions perfectly and all the electronics function perfectly! I HAVE THE ORIGINAL STRAP BUTTONS AND WILL SWITCH THEM IF THE BUYER PREFERS THEM. I just prefer to have larger more secure buttons on all my guitars, but can change them back if the purchaser prefers the original strap buttons. The case has peeling tolex in quite a few places, as well as seperation in the bottom ply but functions fine to carry and protect the guitar!! Also has two replaced hinges. Shipping to the continental USA will be $95 US priority mail. If shipping is less I always re-fund any overcharge! PLEASE NOTE: Shipping outside of the continental USA will go through eBay\u2019s global shipping program and fees will be determined by eBay and paid by the buyer! I have no control over shipping costs outside of the USA and that is handled completely by eBay so bid accordingly!\u00a0 No exceptions!", "ItemID": "332800533098", "EndTime": "2019-01-29T22:43:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-10T15:55:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Extremely-Rare-Red-Ibanez-2387DX-set-neck-Flying-V-Clean-Case-/332800533098", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "San Mateo, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328005330988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F-cAAOSw~TNbRqsm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QDUAAOSwaeRbRqsq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jBIAAOSwL~hbRqsu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/exwAAOSwGgBbRqs1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1VEAAOSwiPJbRqs4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JhgAAOSwhHFbRqsw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2GMAAOSwzbdbRqs6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H7gAAOSwXSRbRqs-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bq8AAOSwSzpbRqtA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ya4AAOSwrYNbRqtD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8WsAAOSwW-1bRqtF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7tsAAOSwuARcR7cS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94402", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stratosfire", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1276, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Extremely Rare Red Ibanez 2387DX set neck Flying V.
