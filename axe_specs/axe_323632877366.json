This Fender Dave Murray California Series Stratocaster gives you a chance to get your hands on the workhorse guitar of a legendary player. It combines traditional Strat style and playability with the rampant energy of three Seymour Duncan humbuckers (two Hot Rails with a JB Jr in the middle). And for an added performance boost, Fender gave the Dave Murray California Series Stratocaster a compound-radius fretboard, making it ideal for both rhythm and lead work. Fender Dave Murray California Series Stratocaster Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance: Seymour Duncan humbuckers deliver seriously aggressive tone Compound-radius fretboard lets you chord and solo with ease Floyd Rose 2-point locking trem adds epic stability to your action Seymour Duncan humbuckers deliver seriously aggressive tone Hot Rails are some of the highest-output pickups Seymour Duncan makes, and their ceramic-magnet-driven tone is a staple among garage rockers and metal heads the world over. That makes them a perfect fit for a guitarist like Dave Murray, whose specialty is old-school, high-octane lead tone with mind-blowing sustain. But there's an element of classic rock to his sound, too, which is where the JB Jr in the middle position of the Dave Murray California Series Stratocaster comes into play, offering you an awesome array of additional tonal character. Compound-radius fretboard lets you chord and solo with ease The Dave Murray California Series Stratocaster features a super-playable 9.5\"-14\" compound-radius fretboard. That means its fingerboard has a traditional 9.5\" radius down by the nut, which makes it easy to grab chords and strum rhythms. As you move up the fretboard where you're more likely to bend notes, the fretboard flattens out to a 14\" radius, which allows you to more easily bend notes - effectively offering you extra fretboard space so you're less likely to run off the edge. Ultimately, the Dave Murray California Series Stratocaster's compound-radius makes transitioning between rhythm and lead playing effortless. Floyd Rose 2-point locking trem adds epic stability to your action If you're looking for an axe you can suspend by the whammy bar (how metal is that?) without knocking it out of tune, then you're going to be happy with the Dave Murray California Series Stratocaster. With its 2-point locking Floyd Rose tremolo, you'll not only get the buttery-smooth bending action only a real Floyd rose can deliver, but you'll also virtually never have to worry about yanking your strings out of tune.
