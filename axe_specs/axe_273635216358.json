{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Too many guitars, must thin out. For sale is a Schecter Super Strat, 22 fret, with HSS pickup configuration and what looks to be an ebony fingerboard. I believe this is an 80's Schecter. I haven't taken it apart and I'm not going to. The guitar plays excellent with low action and no fret buzz. To me, the pickups are very 80's sounding. Other than a repaired chip on the fingerboard above the nut, I see no signs of abuse or mishap. I've owned it for a few years and have had no issues with it at all. Actually, it stays in tune better than many of my hardtail bridge guitars. Hard to believe, but true. Also, it looks to be missing an insert bushing for the vibrato handle. When I bought it, it didn't have it. I don't use them, so never researched a replacement. I bought it because of rumors I was hearing about early Schecters. Well, they were not rumors, it does play extremely well. See the pictures, they tell the story. I have described what I know and/or believe, and that, is what you are buying. If you have more information on this guitar, let me know and I'll correct or update the listing accordingly. Item will ship inside a gig bag, placed inside a factory guitar box. I will ONLY accept Paypal. USPS Shipping ONLY in CONUS. NO International buyers or Shipping. Good luck and Happy bidding!On Jan-05-19 at 14:56:23 PST, seller added the following information: If you do a search on Schecter Super Strat HSS, you'll find the listing on Reverb from a few years ago. That is this guitar. I purchased it. There it states this is a 1982, USA Schecter that was either built by a Schecter employee or a store assembled Shecter from parts. This was common of Scheter guitars of the era.", "ItemID": "273635216358", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T19:35:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T19:35:54.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Schecter-Super-Strat-HSS-80s-Guitar-/273635216358", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "California, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736352163588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Ls8AAOSwIqxcK7To/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/2rQAAOSw7R9cK7Tz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/7ckAAOSw259cK7T4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/MOcAAOSwzFhcK7T-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/04oAAOSwVH9cK7UD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/KQkAAOSwOcpcK7UH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/pOAAAOSw~HFcK8Av/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/1V0AAOSwxoJcK7UM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/90oAAOSw6EpcK7UQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "20619", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kobrahkan", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 361, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 19, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 501}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Schecter Super Strat HSS 80's?
