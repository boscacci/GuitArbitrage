{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Thinning out the herd. I am the original owner of this guitar, which was my main guitar for years. Eclipse 1 CTM, Paul Landers (Rammstein) model. Mahogany body with silver binding and maple top. 24.75\" set neck with 22XJ frets on an ebony board. Gotoh locking tuners (some spec sheets state they are Sperzel. They are Gotoh). EMG 81/60 with two volumes, two tones and a 3-way toggle. You know what the deal is with this particular control layout (as well as the Eclipse 1 body shape). Pickup rings are chromed plastic and the chroming is worn in spots. Guitar is in excellent condition. This is a matte finish, so there are spots that have worn smooth (most notably where your pick hand would rest), as is commonplace with these finishes. This obviously doesn't impact the playability of the guitar. REGARDING FRET WEAR: this is an 8 year old guitar with nickel frets. To say there is \"no fret wear\" is generally untrue. That said, there are no dings, dents, dead or uneven spots on the frets. They are in excellent condition, very slick and will NOT require work on your part. Guitar deserves to go to someone who will play it. It's been in its case for about a year. I'm just not playing single-cuts anymore, and I'm done hoarding guitars just to have them. If you're interested, you can hear the guitar at www.reverbnation.com/thebastardprophecy on the songs Evil Ways, Time For War, and Villain, recorded through a Diezel VH-4 and Framus Cobra. Plays great, great action. Currently tuned to Drop B. Includes OHSC which has some stickers on it.", "ItemID": "264121983423", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T22:54:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T22:54:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-Eclipse-1-CTM-w-OHSC-/264121983423", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Damascus, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641219834238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3MzM=/z/j4gAAOSwv0dcMn-6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9UgAAOSwVP5cMn-u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gBYAAOSwSe5cMn-v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XVkAAOSwws5cMn-x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9OUAAOSwR3tcMn-y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BzYAAOSwjoFcMn-1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JTUAAOSw0TBcMn-2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YxIAAOSwj9hcMn-4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LM8AAOSwvdFcMn-5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5MVg2ODM=/z/ZBAAAOSwws5cMoVh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "20872", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "john-gotti", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 249, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 342}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP Eclipse-1 CTM w/OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Eclipse-1 CTM Paul Landers"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Eclipse"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut"]}]}, "HitCount": 415, "Subtitle": "Paul Landers Model", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
