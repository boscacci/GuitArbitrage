{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a USA model and is blonde/white. I bought this guitar used from my music supervisor to practice on (I am a saxophone player). The previous guitar player had it for 2 weeks and had to give it back to the supervisor. It plays well and stays in tune. The only true defect is a nick on the edge of the 2nd fret by the high E string (see picture). It is cosmetic and does not affect playing or intonation. There are a couple of small cosmetic nicks here and there, but it basically looks brand new. There have not been any alternations to the guitar. I never used it in performance as my primary instruments are woodwinds. When I looked up the serial number (Z0045226), it says it was made in 2000 - 2001. I hate to part with it, but I need to sell it to pay some bills. I am going to include the hard case for free to help protect it during shipping, but please be advised that the case is cracked along one edge of it. The case is still usable.", "ItemID": "362521957486", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T18:09:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T00:05:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/USA-American-Fender-Standard-Telecaster-Electric-Guitar-blonde-white-/362521957486", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Neptune, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3625219574868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y5QAAOSw~sJcKVB3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~~kAAOSw6hNcKVCD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hyoAAOSw6X1cKVCL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kmcAAOSwW~JcKVCS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/k9UAAOSw27lcKVIp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lzUAAOSwsZhcKVIv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9MQAAOSwH61cKVSZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0ZkAAOSwAEFcKVSf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07753", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ricel-3431", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 158}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "USA American Fender Standard Telecaster Electric Guitar blonde/white", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster American Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Ash"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["145102302", "145102306", "145102309", "145102375", "145102502"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["145102302"]}]}, "HitCount": 863, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78630669", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
