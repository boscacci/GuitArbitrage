{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a really cool strat. This is a 2007 Deluxe Roadhouse Strat that has a white parchment style pickguard and white backplate instead of the tortoise shell. The original pickups were texas specials, but they have been swapped out for some alnico 5 60 style pickups (I think they are either Guitar Madness or GFS based on their looks). The neck and middel measure in the low 6k range while the bridge measures in the low 7k range.They sound really good, but I think any pickup combination in here would sound really good because this guitar has a very good quality neck and body. The alder body has a really nice resonance to it, and the maple neck is vintage tinted with a very comfortable shape. Together they really sing. The guitar weighs 7lbs and 15.6oz. This is a really good weight for a stratocaster. Not too light or heavy, but very solid feeling.Everything on the guitar works great. No scratchy pots or shorts. The tone controls are setup for more of a modern strat sound with the middle tone controlling the neck and middle pup, and the bottom tone for the bridge only. This really helps to tame the bridge pickup when needed, even though it sounds great full on. The truss rod is fully functional and can allow for either more or less relief. The guitar is currently setup with 11-50's (either DR blue steels or Gibson brite wires). There is some marks around the 21 fret treble side where a high fret was repaired. There is some wear throughout the guitar. I tried my best to document every aspect of wear and tear, so please view all of the pics carefully.The case has some wear and the middle latch is broke, but the outer two work and it does protect the guitar. Schaller strap lock buttons have been installed too. This guitar will require a signature and will ship with fed ex ground.Message me if you have any questions.", "ItemID": "173671979692", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T03:39:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T19:15:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Deluxe-Roadhouse-Stratocaster-2007-Alpine-White-w-tweed-case-Please-Read-/173671979692", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Collinsville, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736719796928080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jhoAAOSwgVJcBC3y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/d0AAAOSweMdcBC3y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/WGMAAOSwvL1cBC3w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/HAsAAOSwySZcBC3x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/uioAAOSwCPZcBC3x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/dz4AAOSweMdcBC3w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/HtUAAOSwbKdcBC3w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/0EkAAOSw96ZcBC3x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/sG0AAOSw2fRcBC3x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/mQwAAOSw3bZcBC3x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oNoAAOSwOsFcBC4m/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/z44AAOSwihVcBC4o/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "62234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dongeomac", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 731, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***f", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 126}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Deluxe Roadhouse Stratocaster 2007 Alpine White w/tweed case Please Read", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Roadhouse"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 451, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
