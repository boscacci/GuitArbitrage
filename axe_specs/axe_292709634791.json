{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here for auction is a really cool USA Flames Graphic BC Rich St-3 electric guitar with real german made Floyd Rose!! You don't see many of these around too often!! The guitar, as I have been told by the previous owner, is all original, has never had any breaks or repairs, and is in overall very nice condition, with a few paint nicks, that have been photoed. The previous owner told me that he opted for the more expensive German made Floyd Rose when he purchased the guitar from the factory years ago. The guitar weighs close to 9 pounds. The neck plate reads as follows: BC RICH (serial number) B 8029 LA California USA. The case is a non original coffin case, that works perfectly. The guitar and case have no odors, and are from a pet / smoke free, home. There is no whammy bar for the floyd rose unfortunately, but they are very inexpensive and easily found on ebay. In my opinion, the guitar plays and sounds great, and has excellent action, but this is my opinion, and the winning bidder will have their own preferences, that may differ from mine. So, please understand, any set-up, or adjustments, are the responsibility of the winning bidder, and not of the seller. I just want that to be understood in advance. But please rest assured, this guitar plays great, has nice low action, and, once again in my opinion, does not need a thing done to it! The only reason I am selling it, is to make some room around the house, and unfortunately, some of my nice guitars have to be sold, in order to make room. This guitar has a great orange, blue, and yellow, flames graphic on it, and is quite stunning, and very unique!!! This is possibly the only factory made flames graphic on a vintage BC Rich ST-3!!! You will possibly own a one-of-a-kind, vintage instrument! Winning bidder to pay $95 shipping through paypal only immediately after auction ends. The guitar will be sent through the US Post office by insured parcel post mail; USA bidders only please. NO RETURNS - The guitar has been described in perfect accurate detail, and numerous photos from all views have been provided. Please email me with any questions. Thank you and good luck.", "ItemID": "292709634791", "EndTime": "2019-01-30T03:54:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-03T13:28:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980s-USA-FLAMES-GRAPHIC-BC-RICH-ST-III-ST3-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-/292709634791", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pompano Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2927096347918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OYIAAOSwkLJbED5j/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rIwAAOSwruxbED6o/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OSkAAOSw48dbED7x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/b0wAAOSwi3tbED74/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1a4AAOSw4aZbED74/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sawAAOSwQb1bEEX9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fRoAAOSw8FBbEEZP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YWAAAOSwFFZbEEaG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/R1IAAOSwYeNbEEaL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1JkAAOSwQKlbEEdx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CNMAAOSwweRbN6Cn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iHQAAOSwDyBbN6EU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33071", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "danapicard", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1808, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 875.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 875.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980's USA FLAMES GRAPHIC BC RICH ST-III , ST3 ELECTRIC GUITAR!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["B.C.
