{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction a very rare, very original Jerry Jones Longhorn (Long Horn) Bass VI (6 String Bass). It's a 30\" scale bass so it also makes a very awesome baritone guitar with baritone strings (tuned B to B). I'm the second owner and have had the guitar in my collection since about 1996. There is not any great way to date this instrument but the hand painted serial number (see pictures) on the back of the headstock indicates it was made in the late 1980's or early 1990's. so, it's likely 30 years old or so. It's in great condition and plays great!! The neck is nice and straight. Everything on it is original except the white pickguard but as you can see in the pictures, the original clear pickguard will be included. Also included is the original Hard Shell case. I'm also including a new set of D'Addario Baritone strings and a new set of La Bella stainless bass strings (see pictures). this instrument has been stored in my smoke free home and will make someone very happy. Please ask all questions prior to bidding if you need more pictures please don't hesitate to ask. If you want to talk let me know and we'll make arrangements for a phone call.", "ItemID": "312342951431", "EndTime": "2018-12-05T17:28:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-29T00:09:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jerry-Jones-Longhorn-Bass-VI-Barritone-Guitar-Vintage-6-String-Bass-Awesome-/312342951431", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fayetteville, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3123429514318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D7MAAOSw-L5bu86K/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Pr4AAOSwnXZbu86T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TekAAOSwa3Zbu86c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ir0AAOSwr3xbu86k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~V4AAOSwK9lbu86v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CLUAAOSwFXdbu863/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O8YAAOSwZw1bu87D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qWIAAOSwGgdbu87N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lkYAAOSwWlFbu8eC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/i6IAAOSwZKpbu8eG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f1wAAOSwnhJbu857/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "13066", "PrimaryCategoryID": "4713", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Bass Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eosada", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 7312, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 525}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jerry Jones Longhorn Bass VI/Barritone Guitar Vintage 6 String Bass Awesome", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jerry Jones"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Longhorn Bass VI"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Type", "Value": ["Electric Bass"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Barritone/Bass VI"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Longhorn Bass VI"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["7/8"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup", "Lipstick"]}]}, "HitCount": 185, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:4713", "SecondaryCategoryID": "33034", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=10020143", "StoreName": "classicclonesamplification"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 860.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great Condition Some Buckle Rash", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
