Se tu non sai bene l'inglese, cioe' non capisci bene la descrizione di sotto, non esitare a chiedermi qualsiasi domanda in italiano!! Parlo io italiano (ma non molto bene), quindi provo di risponderti nella lingua vostra/ in italiano!! Grazie. Thank you for looking at my auction! This auction is for a vintage Fender Japan Squier Stratocaster. Both Fender and Squier JV models were only made from about mid 1982 thru 1984. This guitar is one of the \"Squier Contemporary\" models. These Contemporary series were switched to be marketed from under the brand of Squier to Fender, around the same time as JV (and SQ) serial changed to E and A serials and they seemed to be started to export to other countries like U.S.A. I think that's why in the U.S.A the \"Squier Contemporary\" models and \"Fender Contemporary\" models with JV serial are quite hard to find.In 1982 Fender introduced their budget \"Squier\" brand to Europe. These Squier export guitars were based on the Fender Japan models (which at that time were only sold in Japan). Shortly after their introduction to the European export market \"Squier\" was also introduced to the Japanese domestic market. This guitar is one of such domestic models, a Japanese market Squier. They had two lines; vintage types and \"Contemporary\" models. The former line's guitars were as less expensive based on the Fender Japan vintage models with less expensive parts, but the latter ones were not less expensive models and some of them had higher prices than \"Fender\" (Japan) models.For your information, the \"Fender Contemporary\" models were the first Fender Japan models to be exported officially as Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters. In Europe Squier \"export\" models with JV serial are highly appreciated, but that is about export models. The Domestic Japanese Squier models might not \"exactly\" the same as as European export Squier models, so the installed parts might be different and the domestic Japanese Squier models were the second line of Fender guitars in Japan, so people might feel the domestic Japanese models were lower quality guitars than the export Squier's. For these people I would like to emphasize that they were made in the same factory (\"Fujigen\") as the main \"Fender\" Brand & the \"Squier\" \"export\" brand by the same skilled craftsmen and the quality of the guitars, wood materials & build accuracy and so on look about same though they used less expensive parts like pickups, bridges, tuners and so on. I think the difference between Squire's domestic & export models and Fender Japan middle ranged models in the era is not so great. These Japan built Squier models are not made anymore. Current Squier models made in China and Indonesia & elsewhere which may seem to be of lesser quality. A while back I had a chance to play a used Fender Japan Stratocaster. I was not familiar with Fender Japan models at the time but after this encounter I began to take an interest in Fender Japan guitars. I was surprised with the quality of the guitar but what impressed me most was its sound. It had bright sound and the higher range was very sharp but not harsh to the ear. I couldn't stop playing the guitar. I knew Fender Japan models of the JV era were appreciated but I thought they were overestimated until I purchased one not long ago for me to try it out. Since then I tried a lot of both Fender Japan and Squier models made in and around the JV era and it has made me appreciate them as so many others do. Anyway the guitar is my favorite now! The Squier brand was Fenders second line with lower prices so they had more budget parts but the build qualities and the materials used were excellent. My JV Stratocaster is not Fender but a Squier with all original budget parts but I really like the sound!! I have read many websites written in English and in Japanese, but I could not find the answers to the following questions: *difference of the spec between Squier export model and Squier Domestic model. *difference of the wood material between Squier and Fender The neck joint plate has been replaced by a previous owner so the guitar has no serial number but the guitar should have been made in between 1982 and 1984/1985 because Squier Contemporary series were switched to Fender Japan Boxer series after the period. The mini switch for the bridge pickup coiltap Regarding the manufacturing country, I believe that the item is made in Japan, but I don't have any official certification so please judge if it is so (or not) for yourself by seeing all the pictures or by info on the internet and so on. SpecsBody: Alder Neck: Maple Fretboard: unknown Neck shape: U shape, fatter (not too much) than most of Fender/Squier guitars with JV serial. Neck width at nut: approx. 43 mm / 1.69 in Weight: approx. 3.55 kg / 7.83 lb. **The specs above are extracted from the catalog or are based on my research, so they could be misinformed or mistaken. The weight and the neck width are based on actual measurement. **I am not the original owner so I cannot say whether this item has all original parts or whether the item is modified, so please judge them by the pictures. Condition of the item **Please refer to the photos & ++TERMS/CONDITION OF ITEM++ section below regarding guitar condition. The neck looks straight and the truss rod works fine. The fretboard is smooth and fine. The frets show normal wear for its age but unless you are very sensitive to the playability, that doesn't affect it. Tuners work fine. The electrics are good but the item is not brand new and some of the electric parts might have got to work after a contact cleaner had been sprayed on them so they might need to be fixed or to be replaced at your expense after you purchase; in some cases as soon as you receive the item. Or at least they might have a slight scratchy sound which can removed by a contact cleaner. There are some blemishes, dents, scratches and so on, as you can see the pictures but on the whole you could say that the guitar is in excellent condition. (There are some more blemishes, dents, scratches and so on that cannot be identified by photos because they are so slight, shallow or small. ) Some wood screw holes of the item could be loose as well as those of many other old or used guitars/basses. The above comment on the condition is my own subjective judgment and I cannot describe all about the item because it is used, so please check the pictures both at the top and at the bottom of this item description and judge the condition for yourself. **Before listing on eBay, I cleaned it up and set it up as far as possible. Accessories No accessories are included. *If you pay the additional shipping fee, a used soft gig bag will be included. Please contact me for the detailed information. (The gig bag is free, but the shipping fee will be higher because the weight of the parcel is heavier.)

If you don't accept all of them then please do not bid or purchase. Condition of the guitar: Almost all of the guitars in my store are not a brand new, but a used one, so they are not always be in \"PERFECT\" condition. This can be especially true of \"VINTAGE\" guitars that have had many years of use and because of this they can sometimes have issues with playability, so for many reasons they may need care and maintenance before reaching an optimal playing condition. Please read the following detailed information that should always be considered when buying a used guitar. *Neck Nowadays a lot of guitar players know the term \"JV\" (Japan Vintage) and that the values of guitars made in and around the JV era are getting higher. I am glad and proud as a Japanese person that these guitars were made by expert craftsmen with selected materials and I totally agree with the reputation that these guitars have earned. However, in Japan, there is a significant humidity difference through the year which can have a bad influence on the materials in guitars if they are not well kept & carefully maintained. Additionally these guitars were often purchased by beginners or students and can tend to be poorly treated without ever having any maintenance. Sometimes they are stored away for ages after a very short period of use, as a result it is often the case that they have issue's about the neck. I have played guitar for many years and all the guitars in my store were listed only after I checked & played them personally. All of the guitars in my store passed the normal standards/my standards unless particularly stated otherwise. However that does not mean \"perfect\" condition as most guitars in the world have some issue be it a scratch or a break. Additionally, the pressure change, humidity change and change in temperature have a bad influence on the guitars during the shipping or after arriving in your country so they may need some adjustment before playing. *Frets As the guitars are used the frets are worn more or less. I cannot say 70% or 80% left or something like that,,,,,because who can count the degree in a precise way? So please check the degree by the pictures. If the guitar needs refreting or if there is any defect with the frets (judging by my standards) it will be stated in the description. *(Fret /String) Buzz I check the Fret (String) Buzz by picking normally with light gauge strings (009-046), adjusting the bottom string height (low E) to 2.0 / 2.5 mm and the top string height (high E) to 1.8 / 2.2 mm. (For basses, the bottom string height/E to 2.8 / 3.3 mm and the top string height/G to 2.3 / 2.8 mm.) The guitars are used, so slight buzz could occur. If the fret buzz of the guitar is above the normal standard, the detail is described in the description of the guitar. Anyway, how you feel the fret buzz depends on the player, so any requests to settle repair fee is not accepted. *Cosmetic condition As the guitars are used, they might have a number of dents, scratches, blemishes, chips and so on. Unless they are in mint or near mint condition, you cannot describe all of them, so please judge the condition by the pictures. *Electrical parts ALL the electrical parts work fine unless there is a particular fault in which case it will be mentioned in the description, but they might have a slight scratchy sound. *Tax and duties As stated above, the auction winner or the buyer is responsible for any and all applicable taxes and duties levied by their government. Before placing a bid or clicking \"Buy it now\" button, please enquire with your local customs for detailed information. *Return Please check the guitar within two days of it being delivered to you. If it differs significantly from the description I will accept the return. Payment made for returned goods and the outward shipping fee you paid will be refunded to you within three business days after the guitar is returned and checked by me on received. Please note that any return freight charges, taxes &/or duties you pay for returning an item are not settled. *Insurance for transportation The insurance of EMS would cover any damage, loss or the robbery/theft of an item during transportation. The EMS insurance reimbursements might take more than a month to process. ++My Attitude toward business transactions As a seller, I do not want to disappoint any buyers when they receiving an item and check it. *Other condition If you are new to eBay and have zero feedback or have negative feedback, please contact me before bidding and provide me with your name and your email address for PayPal or your bid will be withdrawn. ++DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT SHIPPING++*To Asia (First Zone) ..............US$117 such as China (People's Rep.), Guam, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea (Rep.), Malaysia, Saipan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and so on. *To North America/Central America (Second Zone)..........US$136 such as United States, Canada, Mexico and so on. *To Oceania (Second Zone).........US$136 such as Australia, New Zealand and so on. *To Middle East (Second Zone) ..........US$136 such as United Arab Emirates, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Bahrain, Cyprus, Jordan, Kuwait and so on. *To Europe (Second Zone)..........US$147 such as Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovak, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom and so on. *To South America (Third Zone)..........US$206 such as Brazil, Chile and so on.
