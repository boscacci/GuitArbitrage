{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Rare lawsuit-era Les Paul copy by Electra. This is an Omega model. I believe this dates to 1976 based on the open-book style headstock design, but I could be wrong on that. This appears to be a multi-piece body with a nice flame maple top. Matching flame maple veneer on headstock with abalone insignia. Tuners, bridge, and tailpiece are original. Original pickguard was removed. This guitar came original with a 6-way rotary switch, 1 volume knob, 1 tone knob, and two phase-selector toggle switches. All electronics including pickups, knobs, pots, and switches were removed. All cavities were lined with copper foil shielding tape, and the guitar was rewired in a standard LP configuration (2 volume, 2 tone, 3-way toggle). The pickups are Seymour Duncan Seth Lover with gold covers. Gold Dunlop strap locks installed. Electronics were just checked, cleaned, and re-soldered for ground, and the guitar set up with Ernie Ball 10\u2019s by Tone Tailors in Lititz, PA. There are multiple dings and scratches, some of which go down to bare wood. I\u2019ve done my best to take pictures of all of them, at least the most apparent ones. Holes from original pickguard are apparent. There is also some corrosion on the metal parts, with the gold plating wearing off on the bridge and tailpiece especially. Includes SKB-style case in good shape with no structural issues. Marks on case from where masking tape was on previously. Auction also includes black leather strap with strap locks.
