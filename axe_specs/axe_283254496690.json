{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello Everyone,Rob here...more cool guitars! This listing is for my 1993 Gibson Les Paul Studio with ebony fingerboard, bone nut, Grover Aged Gold Rotomatic Milk Bottle tuners (shown in pics 8 and 11), Zhangbucker Slugbucker bridge pickup, un-potted Gibson 498T neck pickup, Russian Paper/Oil .033uF tone capacitors, Creation Audio Lab Redeemer Circuit (check that out) and of course the pinup girl stickers on the front : ).....whew...that's a lot of stuff!So take a minute to look at the pictures and take it all in. She has been modified, she has been played, the frets have wear, she has dings, finish cracks and who knows what else happened to the back...BUT...she plays GREAT and likes to ROCK \\m/ (><) \\m/. She sounds brighter than many Les Pauls I have had in the past which is a good thing if you run scales and play Ozzy, Whitesnake, hair metal kinda stuff...maybe not so good if you are just a chord strummer. She weighs about 9 pounds 6 oz so she isn't a lightweight but also isn't all that heavy considering other LPs from the 90's. There are no known breaks or repairs and no issues keeping you from rocking out with her for many more years. When you roll the neck tone knob right on 10, it actually sounds like it is on like 5, so I usually roll it just off the 10 and it works/sounds fine (I never touch the neck tone anyway)...and I added a couple of pics with the installed aged Grover tuners...these are the ones on the guitar currently NOT the \"booger\" tuners....so once again...she comes with the upgraded AGED GROVERS in pics 8 and 11.So there you have it...a really, really cool guitar that reminds me of the Steve Jones Sex Pistols LP but at a much lower price. If you are looking for a great playing guitar with an awesome vibe and tons of MOJO...get her before she is gone. This kind of guitar is going to appeal to a player and not a collector or novice...like I said...she has been played and seen some action...I got her out of Nashville and she would love to be on stage rocking out again. I will be shipping this LP with a hard case to make sure she arrives safely. Shipping will be insured with signature required inside the continental United States. If anyone has any questions or if you want different pictures, just let me know because I have many more of all over the guitar and I will get back to you quickly. Be sure and check out my other listings for more cool gear.Regards : )rob P.S. there have been some questions asked....so there are two \"stickers\" on the guitar...one appears to be a waterslide and the other an actual sticker. These can easily be removed and seem to have been fairly recent additions; however, I cannot guarantee that you won't be able to see where they were once removed.", "ItemID": "283254496690", "EndTime": "2018-12-20T10:44:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T01:16:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1993-Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-White-Relic-Redeemer-Zhangbucker-Pinup-Sex-Pistols-/283254496690", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Washougal, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832544966908080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/8pQAAOSw8Vtb6R2w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/7FgAAOSwmUFb6R2Q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/~xEAAOSwpwBb6R3u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/m24AAOSw1Exb6R3z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DgkAAOSw0QBb6R34/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/YnEAAOSwWB5b6R37/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/MmwAAOSwF~hb6R4D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bxcAAOSw4vpb6R70/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/p-8AAOSwatBb6R4p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/LjIAAOSwMZJb6R4y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q7AAAOSwhzhb6R8F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/1KsAAOSw~XZb6SCM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98671", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rockinrob8197", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 644, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1095.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1095.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 2}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1993 Gibson Les Paul Studio White Relic Redeemer Zhangbucker Pinup Sex Pistols", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ebony"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 290, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
