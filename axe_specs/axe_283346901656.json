{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2016 Fender American Elite Telecaster Butterscotch Blonde w/ OHSC 2016 Fender American Elite Telecaster Butterscotch Blonde w/ OHSC Fender's American Elite Telecaster solidbody electric guitar is great instrument for pickers who love the classic platform but need a wider palette of tones. You'll get the familiar twang and cut Teles are known for, but without the 60 cycle hum thanks to a pair of fourth-generation Fender Noiseless single-coil pickups. An S-1 switch adds new pickup voicings to the American Elite Tele. And features like a 9.5\"-14\" compound-radius fretboard make these guitars effortless to play. The Fender American Elite Telecaster is the future of one of the most popular workhorse guitars ever. This pre owned Tele is a killer player with wonderful action and all of the spank and twang that you would expect out of a good Tele. This guitar shows one good ding on the side that you can see in the photos. Otherwise it is in great shape and will be ready to rock right out of the box. It includes its original Fender hardshell case.\u00a0 Ryan Fowler's Guitar Experience is one of Maryland's premier brick and mortar guitar shops.
