{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Folks this RARE Promotional Vintage 2000 Bose in Graphite Color Wave Radio & CD Player Model AWRC1-G was \"Only Sold To Select Fender Guitar Dealers in USA\" making this the Rarest PROMO Bose Wave Radio Ever Made. Boy I remember the looking at the Stratocaster but this Fender logo-ed Bose Wave Radio was the gem I was after, heck it is sure a rare bird indeed. I have never seen another \"Fender Logo'd Bose Wave Radio with CD Player\" for sale anywhere at any price. To a Fender Collector this item is one of those pieces that is a needle in a haystack. I have always been a fan of Bose Wave Radio's with CD especially this era/model for it has the buttons on top so you do not need a remote (new ones you need remote so is harder to use) plus it has 2 selectable alarms instead of only 1 in current model. I purchased this Bose from my local guitar store in 2003 as I had to have it in my collection. It took almost 4 months to pry it from his hands. It was lightly used and never in a smokers home and I rate condition a 9+ on a 1-10 scale. Complete with remote still in plastic wrapper. Tuner picks up excellent and CD operates as it should. I never tried MP3's so I do not know if it will play them. I will include a New FM T antenna although I never needed one. Display is bright and perfect as well as all other functions. There is an Aux Input for optional item like Ipod, TV, Tape Deck, Etc. Also a Variable Output to connect to an amplifier or your stereo system. I DO NOT have Original Box but have a Bose Wave Radio box and packing from a later model so will be perfect for shipping. I will charge $50 for shipping and when shipped will refund excess if any. I will even double box to insure safe arrival of this gem. Shipping will be UPS Insured with Signature Confirmation.
