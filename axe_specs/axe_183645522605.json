Demo Video Dickey Betts SG One of the most storied guitars in rock and roll history, the 1961/62 Gibson SG Standard given to Duane Allman by Dickey Betts during their playing days together, is an instrument of near-mythic proportions. Betts gifted Allman an SG so he didn\u2019t have to wait while Duane re-tuned. Instead Allman could switch between the 1961/62 Gibson SG Standard and one of his Les Pauls. This guitar has long been feted as an iconic road warrior, and a classic tone machine. Now Gibson Custom has recreated this living slice of rock history in extremely limited numbers as the Dickey Betts \u201cFrom One Brother to Another\u201d SG. Produced in extremely limited numbers, with 75 examples hand-aged by Gibson Custom and signed by Betts, and another 250 featuring Gibson Custom's VOS (Vintage Original Spec) finish process and appointments, this model is an exacting reproduction of a stand-out SG from a golden age of guitar production. It offers the sublime tone and playing feel that these guitars are known for, with the looks of a hard-working legend. The body of the Dickey Betts \u201cFrom One Brother to Another\u201d SG is constructed from one piece of genuine mahogany, carved to the historically accurate early \u201960s SG shape with dual asymmetrical horns and beveled edges. A deep-set glued-in neck is carved from one piece of superior quarter-sawn mahogany and topped with a rosewood fingerboard with 22 \u201cbanjo frets\u201d like the original. All examples are finished in genuine hand-sprayed nitrocellulose lacquer in Vintage Red; 75 of these will be meticulously hand aged to match the look of the original guitar, while a further 250 will be treated to Gibson Custom\u2019s acclaimed VOS process, which exhibits the look of a gently aged and faded instrument. Details of the hand aging include the extreme fading and minor wear on the top of the SG, the ageing of all hardware and plastics, and considerable wear to the back of the neck, with minor dings and large patches of finish missing do to the heavy playing time this guitar experienced. All in all, the Dickey Betts \u201cFrom One Brother to Another\u201d SG accurately embodies the look and feel of the original 1961/62 SG given to Allman by Betts. SG Standards of the early \u201960s carried some of the finest Gibson humbucking pickups ever made, units in transition between the \u201cPatent Applied For\u201d and \u201cPatent Number\u201d eras. To capture this superlative tone, Gibson Custom loads the Dickey Betts \u201cFrom One Brother To Another\u201d SG with a pair of Custom Buckers with aged nickel covers, wound and constructed to precise PAF specs, with rare Alnico III magnets and slightly mismatched and unpotted coils, two of the secrets to the articulate and slightly edgy tone for which great PAF and Patent No. pickups are famous. The guitar carries a genuine Nylon 6/6 nut, with slots cut on Gibson\u2019s PLEK for optimum precision, which are matched by nylon saddles in the ABR-1 Tune-o-matic bridge. To mirror a popular modification of the time, as performed on the original guitar, this SG carries a stopbar tailpiece in place of the Lyre vibrola, an upgrade undertaken to improve sustain and stability, while a set of enclosed metal-button nickel tuners represent another common modification. All in all, this exclusive guitar presents a miraculous means of getting a realistic slice of Allman Brothers tone and history into your hands\u2014but numbers are extremely limited, so check out the Dickey Betts \u201cFrom One Brother to Another\u201d SG at your authorized Gibson dealer today.
