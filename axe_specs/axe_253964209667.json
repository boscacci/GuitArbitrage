No matter what your genre, this Strat offers all the iconic features and qualities of the classic model at an exceptional price. For smooth playability, flawless quality, and legendary tone in an affordable Fender, the Standard Strat with maple fingerboard is an easy choice.Timeless Features and DesignEvery feature of this Strat comes backed with a legacy as old as the electric guitar itself. The time-tested combination of three single-coil pickups offer a robust tonal palette, while the iconic contoured body shape provides ample comfort and playability. The neck is made of maple using modern C-shape profile and capped with a maple fingerboard. Rounded out by an array of vintage-styled flourishes and a high mass bridge blocked with included tremolo arm, it's hard to imagine how Fender packed so much into such an affordable guitar.The Right Tone for Any OccasionSince 1954, the Stratocaster has supplied guitarists with an swiss army knife of tonal tools by way of its versatile three pickup configuration. A five-way pickup selector allows simple switching between the various combinations which places a huge range of tonal potential at your fingertips. Funky high-end sparkle, countrified twang, denser blues-rock tones -- the Fender Standard Strat does it all and more. Think of the guitar giants who have yielded Strats over the years: Bluesmen like Buddy Guy and Stevie Ray Vaughn, classic-rockers like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, and alt-rock icons like Billy Corgan and John Frusciante. Every one of them left a mark on the sound of popular music, and they each did it with a Strat in hand.Features:- Classic Stratocaster design, tone, and feel- Modern C-shape neck profile with comfortable maple fingerboard and smooth satin back finish- Three classic standard single-coil Strat pickups and five-way selector- Vintage-style synchronized tremolo bridge with groovy whammy bar- Three-ply pickguard and chrome hardware for major vintage appealFor first-time players and old pros alike, no guitar collection is complete without an iconic Fender Strat.
