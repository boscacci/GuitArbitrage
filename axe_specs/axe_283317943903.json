{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "With a heavy heart I am selling the best guitar I've ever played, and I've been playing 51 years and unfortunatly the hands don't work so well anymore. This is a 1980 Tokai LS-120 Reborn Old, the rarest most sought after Tokai as they were only made for 4 months during 1980. Based on the 59 Les Paul this is one of the most accurate 59 burst copys you can buy. Spec's are one piece Mahogany back and neck, two piece top, rosewood board, thin nitro finish, fret end nibs, just an amazing guitar all around. This example is superb too, very little play wear and almost no visible defects, looks like it's 4 years old instead of 38 years old. Sounds & plays just incredibly. Modifications include S/D Antiquities, Gibson Historic plastics, Faber aluminum tailpiece, switchcraft switch & jack, CTS pots, Luxe Bumblebee caps & 50's wiring. This is an amazing guitar, better than ANY Gibson r9 or historic I've played. Comes with original PCB board and Hardshell case lifton style. Pictures are with the original pickups installed, will ship with the antiquities installed. Best of all it's only 8.5 lbs and just sings. No disappointments on this one.", "ItemID": "283317943903", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T23:52:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-27T07:02:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980-Tokai-Reborn-Old-LS-120-Exceptional-condition-59-burst-replica-/283317943903", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833179439038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDU0MA==/z/qasAAOSw29JcJHgS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDA3WDkwMA==/z/FwwAAOSwn01cJHgT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/NDYAAOSwHPdcJHgU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/YPEAAOSwVRBcJHgU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/9uAAAOSw8OFcJHgW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/~0MAAOSwwFNcJHgX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/IAEAAOSwpFtcJHgY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDUzMw==/z/gkgAAOSw8LZcJHgY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/QlAAAOSw5qdcJHgZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/qj0AAOSwgzBcJHgc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/BUgAAOSwdZBcJHgc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "87112", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "area51recording", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 220, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 272}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980 Tokai Reborn Old LS 120  Exceptional condition, 59 burst replica.....", "HitCount": 46, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
