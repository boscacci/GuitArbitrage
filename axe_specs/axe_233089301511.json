{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hi everyone, Up for sale is a fantastic example of the pinnacle of Japanese guitar production, and a rare model at that! It was made in the Matsumoku factory alongside many of the highest quality Japanese arch tops and lawsuit guitars of its era. The Emperor T is a very cool model in that it is a cross between and L5 and a 335. The body shape and neck specs are that of an L5, but the construction resembles that of a 335. After inspecting the grain of the interior and exterior, it appears that it has a solid carved spruce top and maple back and sides. There is a solid block running the center of the body and it is 2\u201d thick. The neck is 3 piece maple with a dark, smooth black ebony fretboard. The inlays appear to be real MOP and abalone, but I cannot confirm that. The quality of this guitar is astounding, easily well above that of the average Gibson during this time period. It is in perfect shape structurally. The neck is stable and straight. It plays like absolute butter with low action. As far as I know, everything except the pickups are original. The previous owner told me they were swapped for Gibson 57 Classics at some point. Cosmetically it is in incredible shape for a near 40 year old guitar. There are a few scratches and dings here and there, but honestly looks cleaner than a lot of 5 year old guitars. I do have the original pickguard and it will be included in the auction. I had plans to put an L5 pickguard on it but never got around to it. The only real notable flaw is that the original strap button hole was filled and a new strap button was installed on the heel (see pic). This is also a fantastic sounding, versatile guitar. It is right at home with jazz, blues, R&B and rock. It sounds a good bit more 335 than L5, but it is a little warmer and open than a 335 due to the trapeze tailpiece and spruce top. Comes with a gig bag This is a super cool rare guitar that will not disappoint! Feel free to contact me with any questions!", "ItemID": "233089301511", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T06:48:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T23:13:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Emperor-T-MIJ-Matsumoku-1981-L5-Made-Japan-/233089301511", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330893015118080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NzY=/z/SPEAAOSwkHxcN9DA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bU0AAOSw3BJcN9DG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg0NTQ=/z/SO8AAOSwkHxcN9C~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MzQ=/z/gHgAAOSwx9lcN9DC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NDA=/z/4lAAAOSw5qJcN9DB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SQAAAOSwkHxcN9DJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Px0AAOSwk4RcN9DI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDMy/z/1r8AAOSw6eRcN9DE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MjA=/z/lJsAAOSwCXxcN9DF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "27408", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "yoshimori0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 232, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2095.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2095.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 599}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Emperor T MIJ Matsumoku 1981 L5 Made In Japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 38, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
