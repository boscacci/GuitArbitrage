{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is my Peavey PowerSlide. It was used a few times in my studio, never gigged. There are a few light scratches on the back and on the back of the neck (see pics) and its a little dusty. The original protective cellophane is still on the pickup and on the pick guard so when you pull that off it will look brand new. All the original accessories are included except for the original cheapie slide which has been replaced by a good Stevens steel. The strap, soft bag, original documentation and even the original shipping boxes are included as well as a new unopened set of strings. The PowerSlide works great and sounds terrific but I don't use it enough to keep it. I will ship this item to the CONUS only. I ship on Monday and Friday so please get your winning bid paid promptly to avoid a delay in shipping!", "ItemID": "323555834582", "EndTime": "2018-11-25T00:18:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-18T00:18:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-PowerSlide-Metal-Flake-Red-Upgraded-Steel-Slide-Accessories-/323555834582", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Wauconda, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235558345828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTc2WDI3Nw==/z/c64AAOSw3S5b6hU2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDMyWDU3Ng==/z/PdwAAOSw3LVb6hU9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTc2WDI2Nw==/z/W2AAAOSwDElb6hVD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDMyWDU3Ng==/z/haYAAOSwkHxb6hVJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTc2WDI3Ng==/z/~90AAOSwo1lb6hVP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDMyWDU3Ng==/z/ZjcAAOSwBfhb6hVW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzM1WDU3Ng==/z/BL8AAOSwAThb6hVd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MjY0WDU3Ng==/z/3Y8AAOSwr-Bb6hVk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "98859", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "knifemkr", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1685, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 266}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey PowerSlide  Metal Flake Red  Upgraded Steel Slide, Accessories", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["PowerSlide"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 64, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 177.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Barely used, a few light scratches on back of neck and body.
