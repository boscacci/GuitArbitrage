{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "-This guitar, for all intents and purposes is LIKE almost new!- Hello everyone! Today, you are in for a beautiful treat! If you are looking at this post, you already know what it is. It is the highly regarded Fender Stratocaster American Vintage Reissue 70's in the most beautiful Ash Natural finish. The top is beautiful!!!It is in excellent condition this 2007 made American Vintage Reissue 70's.Wonderful Grain in the Ash body. Rosewood fret board-large head stock-bullet nut-etc plays wonderful and sounds awesome.Comes in an aftermarket Fender tweed case. A high spec USA made Fender Strat with all the flair and tone of an original 70's model!Admit it, you loved the '70s, and so do I! This hybrid \"best of the '70s\" American Vintage Stratocaster\u00ae guitar features all of the greatest elements of the now-classic '70s Strat guitars, including an ash (on transparent finishes) or alder body, U-shaped maple neck with improved three-bolt neck and Micro Tilt\"! neck adjustment, '70-'71 vintage-correct bridge, \"Diamond Head \u2018F'\" tuners and specially voiced pickups. Other features include the unmistakable large headstock, '70s-style decal and bullet truss rod adjustment nut. As you can see, the top is gorgeous and the guitar is in MINT condition. The original frets show no wear all just like the rest of the guitar, but I\u2019ll let the pictures do the talking. Like mentioned before, the top is beautiful and the guitar has no buckle rash whatsoever. It comes with the \"Thermometer\" Tweed (like) Hard case that is great looking as well. I'm adding a Tweed Cable and a Guitar Strap. New, this guitar cost a fortune and from me now, you can get it for much, much cheaper. This guitar was purchased about 11 years ago, set up and then put away til now, without ever really having been played. It was cleaned very regularly and shows no tarnishing or any other type of wear that usually shows up from age; this thing is immaculate and was stored perfectly in a climate controlled space. The neck is the 70\u2019s style neck that is not as slim as these new slim necks, but definitely slimmer than the 50\u2019s. Plugged in to my Amp (Marshall) it is a match made in heaven and the tone and sustain is second to none and it is ready to rock. Honestly, here is that rare opportunity to purchase a beautiful, GREAT condition Strat with a killer looks at a really, really good price compared to what other people are selling these for when they do appear and in much, much worse condition. Don\u2019t let this one slip away as I know it will not last and I speak from experience. Due to the very attractive price and the immaculate condition of this guitar, as well as parts included in the sale, I know that I will be contacted a lot and with that said, I won\u2019t be able to hold the guitar for anyone; it\u2019ll be first come first serve. Furthermore, I reserve the right to end this sale at any time should my guitar sell locally or on other websites listed. I\u2019ve described this guitar to the best of my ability.
