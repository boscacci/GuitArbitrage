{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sell is my PRS SE Torero. I got a new CE 24 for Christmas, so I'm \"thinning the herd\". I bought this guitar used from Guitar Center since it was in such good condition and had it professionally set up for D standard. The guitar has been well taken care of and doesn't show a whole lot of wear other than your usual playing surface scratches that doesn't even show up in the photos. If you are into hard rock and metal, you will love the active EMG pickups. It will be securely shipped with gig bag shown that I purchased for it when I bought it. I will ship to US locations only. Sorry about the stock photo being shown. I couldn't delete it for some reason. This guitar is Silverburst, not blue.", "ItemID": "303011187379", "EndTime": "2019-01-04T16:27:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-28T16:27:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-SE-Torero-Electric-Guitar-/303011187379", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Grand Bay, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030111873798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RAcAAOSwY4JcJkic/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ij4AAOSwPA1cJki0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kGoAAOSwiOZcJkjQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lbIAAOSwVIBcJkjq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/h7kAAOSwRfxcJkj9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iosAAOSwAopcJkkZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "36541", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rumblefish1975_0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 7, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 20, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 79}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith SE Torero Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SE Torero"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silverburst"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["EMG active pickups"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 489, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 385.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "159805863", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
