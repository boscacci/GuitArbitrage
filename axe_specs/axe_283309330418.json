{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is outstanding guitar. 1997 (first year) Fender California Series Stratocaster. These were essentially hybrid models, using USA standard bodies and necks with vintage hardware. The bodies and necks were finished in Mexico, but the final assembly/prep/inspection happened in the USA. The Black finish is deep and perfect. No dings, scratches at all except for the most minor. The maple neck is in great shape as well. No fret wear. The only flaw is a small spot in between the fourth and fifth frets in between the G and B strings where the finish has rubbed off. It plays and sounds excellent! No buzz, and the pickups are a little hotter than most vintage-style pickups. I had a little extra shielding tape added to the inside so that it is really quiet for a single-coil Strat. It comes with the original gig bag, tremolo arm, and candy still sealed! Thanks for looking and good luck! *** ADDENDUM *** I was asked the weight of the guitar, although my digital scale is broken, so I can't 100% positive down to the tenth, my manual postal scale reads exactly 8.0 pounds. Also, yes, the truss rod works and the neck adjusts and sets up beautifully. It is a great playing guitar.", "ItemID": "283309330418", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T03:51:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T03:51:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Fender-California-Series-Stratocaster-w-Original-Gig-Bag-and-Paperwork-/283309330418", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Brookfield, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833093304188080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4CcAAOSw1ExcDAsf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7kMAAOSwzXJcDRZ4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g7cAAOSwg5FcDRZ-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b9YAAOSwSidcDAsZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p7UAAOSw8hdcDAsa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/prYAAOSwMpFcDAsR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gG4AAOSwFZZcDAtc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wKkAAOSwlINcDAsT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Hi8AAOSw8L5cDAse/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y7cAAOSwq6VcDAsS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G9MAAOSwF8FcDAsW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9HgAAOSwmvpcDAsb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53005", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kevinmntr87", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 88, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 535.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 535.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Fender California Series Stratocaster w/Original Gig Bag and Paperwork", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}]}, "HitCount": 298, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 545.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
