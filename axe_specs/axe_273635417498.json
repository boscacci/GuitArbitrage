{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 1996 FENDER STRAT PLUS in VERY GOOD condition, with an Crimson Burst finish and original case. Great looks, tone and playability. This guitar is in super clean condition, with the only flaw being slightly worn laquer in a small area on back of the neck; and some small imperfections in the finish on back of the body. These are pictured. It has been set up with medium action. It plays wonderfully, the neck is super smooth (satin finish), and the fretboard and frets are in near mint condition.The Fender Gold Lace Sensor pickups deliver classic Fender tone with a very articulate tonal range, and are balanced at all volumes with no hum and lots of sustain. These pickups have been used by some of the world\u2019s best guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Pete Townsend, and Buddy Guy. The guitar comes with the original Fender hardshell case with a key and manufacturing tag, which is lightweight but very strong. The exterior is in fair condition with slightly warped area on one end, although it does not prevent the case from closing and locking. There is also a small crack that does not seem to affect the strength of the case, but it's noteworthy in this case. The case interior is in great shape. Please ask any questions before bidding. Everything works fine on the guitar including the truss rod. Once I set this up I've never had to adjust the guitar... it's very stable.
