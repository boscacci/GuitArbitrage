{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Great opportunity to get a vert versatile instrumentIbanez JS24P Premium Joe Satriani Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance:Thin, rigid neck and treated frets for maximum playabilityDual DiMarzio pickups serve up unexpected tonal versatilityHighpass filter enhances highs when you roll your volume downThin, rigid neck and treated frets for maximum playability You'll find that the JS neck profile on the Ibanez JS24P Premium gives you a solid fretting foundation while allowing you to play as fast as you like. It's a 3-piece maple/bubinga neck, too, which is more rigid than 1-piece neck and transfers vibration better. And no matter how fast you shred, you won't shred your fingers. The medium frets on the Joe Satriani JS24P Premium have received Ibanez's Premium treatment, which smooths down the edges for an amazingly fluid feel.Dual DiMarzio pickups serve up unexpected tonal versatility You wouldn't expect anything less than powerful, rich tone from DiMarzio humbuckers. There's a single-coil-sized Chopper humbucker at the neck and a Mo' Joe humbucker at the bridge - both chosen for their tonal tenacity and strong output. But the Ibanez JS24P Premium Joe Satriani also packs a push-pull tone control to coil tap the bridge pickup. That gives you access to single-coil tones, too, greatly expanding the tonal range of the JS24P Premium.Highpass filter enhances highs when you roll your volume down If working your volume knob is a big part of your playing style, then you'll love the volume control on the Ibanez JS24P Premium. It houses a push-pull highpass filter, which prevents you from losing your high-frequency edge when you've got your volume rolled back. This lets you keep your definition and edge when you're cleaning up your tone, then easily switch to full-bore tone when you want to send your amp into overdrive territory.Ibanez JS24P Premium Joe Satriani Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:Joe Satriani Signature guitar designed for maximum playability and tonal diversityDual DiMarzio humbucking pickups are Joe Satriani's favoritesPush-pull coil tap and highpass filter greatly expand your sonic optionsMedium frets have the Premium fret edge treatment, giving them a smoother, rounder feelMade in the Ibanez Premium Factory.
