The sunburst Les Paul Standards of 1958-\u201960 may grab most of the attention, but for some of the true tone hounds out there, the 1954 Les Paul Model \u201cGoldtop\u201d embodies raw blues and rock\u2019n\u2019roll more than any other guitar on the planet. From Carl Perkins\u2019 recordings of \u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d and \u201cBlue Suede Shoes\u201d to Freddie King\u2019s \u201cHideaway\u201d, a Goldtop was there, rippin\u2019 it up and making musical history in the process. When Les Paul and Gibson sat down at the drawing board to devise the first solidbody electric from a leading guitar manufacturer, Les insisted that this radical new instrument needed to be finished in gold, a color that would claim the Les Paul Model\u2019s place in the world. Marrying a solid, lightweight mahogany back to a carved maple top was the first stroke of genius, and established the most legendary tonewood combination in the history of electric guitar manufacturing. With the addition of the wraparound bridge in late \u201953/early \u201954, the Les Paul had arrived, and it has never looked back. The Gibson Custom Shop\u2019s 1954 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue is the veritable second coming of this revered yet short-lived variant of the venerable Les Paul, presenting all the period-correct finepoints that aficionados of the breed know and love. With its hot, gritty P-90 single-coil pickups, deep-set, long-tenon neck joint; lightweight wraparound \u201cstud\u201d bridge; and chunky, rounded \u201950s neck profile, this baby is the real deal, raw and ready to rock. The sonic powerhouse of the 1954 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue remains its two fat single-coil P-90 pickups, beloved since the 1940s for their aggressive midrange, solid low end, and sparkling, silky highs\u2014with that ever so slightly gritty edge for added cutting power. Gibson makes its P-90s today just like it did a full 60 years ago, with two Alnico V bar magnets in each pickup and coils wound with approximately 10,000 turns of 42 AWG wire, for plenty of beef when you hit \u2019em hard, but crystalline clean tones when you back off the guitar\u2019s volume controls. Bumble Bee tone caps assist in that warm, singing \u201cwoman tone\u201d when you roll back the tone controls, too. To top it all off, the 1954 Les Paul Goldtop Reissue plays superbly right out of its Custom Shop hardshell case thanks to a trip through one of Gibson\u2019s state-of-the-art Plek machines before it leaves the Custom Shop floor.", "ItemID": "132694668521", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T17:22:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-07-07T20:41:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2009-Gibson-Custom-Shop-Historic-Collection-1954-Les-Paul-Gold-Top-Reissue-/132694668521", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Belle Mead, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1326946685218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vwUAAOSwjiFbQSR9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/KRUAAOSwrj1bQSSE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/OF0AAOSwPvRbQSSK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/b80AAOSwduZbQSSQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/RAIAAOSwfXFbQSSV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XcoAAOSwjmFbQSSa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~~cAAOSwEjlbQSSf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yXcAAOSw2sZbQSTR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/m0UAAOSwHJVbQSTW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jbgAAOSwX0xbQSS-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9~8AAOSw27FbQSTX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4m8AAOSwE9RbQSTf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "08502", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "richtar98", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 558, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3999.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3999.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 72}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2009 Gibson Custom Shop Historic Collection 1954 Les Paul Gold Top Reissue ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["1954 Les Paul Reissue"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2009"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 2165, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=5697901", "StoreName": "MYMUSICCOLLECTIBLES"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
