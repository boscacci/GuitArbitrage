{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Extremely Rare 1997 Jimi Hendrix Tribute Stratocaster in excellent condition. One little pot mark (see pic) and 2 or 3 ever so light scuffs in the back not noticeable in regular light, you would need to study it with a flashlight at a certain angle to see it. I got this on a trade so don't know much owner history about it. What I do know is the tone is killer! I'm a big Hendrix fan, and had a Voodoo Stratocaster back in the day. I couldn't find one of those so took this on partial trade. Sounds amazing, only thing for me is, it's tough to play on the higher frets, due to the fact it's an exact replica of how Hendrix would play, so the body is actually upside down. We all know he had huge hands, I can't work up there like he could with this setup (not that many could). Anyways that's the only reason I'm selling it. I'm not a collector so have no inclination to sit on it for an investment. I like ones that I can play easily. However, if I was thinking of investing in them for money, this definitely would be a first choice candidate as they are so rare (only made for 1 year), and the tone on a strat just gets better with age. This guitar has earned some mojo over the years for sure. For a 21 year old guitar, this is in fantastic condition! No bidders with zero or negative feedback. Hate to be like that but been burned too many times. Shipping will be about 60 bucks. Continental US only. I have them professionally wrapped at the UPS store when sending out. Thank you for looking.

Does not affect playability even remotely, but wanted to make sure bidders are aware. On Dec-03-18 at 13:50:28 PST, seller added the following information: Case locks aren't in that good of shape. Looks like someone tried to pry them open. I thought I should clarify incase someone is looking at this for the total package. Just assume you are bidding on guitar, case is fine, but the original case jewelry etc./chord, etc. is gone.", "ItemID": "223251135879", "EndTime": "2018-12-05T03:28:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-25T03:28:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Fender-Jimi-Hendrix-Tribute-Stratocaster-White-Electric-Guitar-w-OHSC-/223251135879", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bridgewater, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232511358798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/PhAAAOSwJ~xb-hHc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/YsMAAOSw0vJb-hHn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/vNcAAOSwuUlb-hHs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/YtEAAOSwcs1b-hHw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/2zoAAOSwqiJb-hH2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/O4EAAOSwfgRb~ZJy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08807", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rajasthan77", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 278, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 983}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Fender Jimi Hendrix Tribute Stratocaster White Electric Guitar w/OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Country of Manufacture", "Value": ["USA"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Olympic White"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 352, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
