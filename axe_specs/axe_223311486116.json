{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here\u2019s a Rare Vintage 1956 Silvertone 1352 Electric Archtop Guitar with a Gibson P-13 Pickup. This was made by Harmony and is the same as the fifties H-61. The Gibson powered Harmony guitars have become some of the most desirable and collectable guitars that Harmony ever built.\u00a0 \u2028 This is a great sounding and playing guitar, and is in amazing condition for its age. It has recently been completely gone over in the shop and is ready to go. The pickup sounds incredible, and the Tone & Volume controls are all working properly. The action is clean and very smooth on every note from one end of the fretboard to the other. The neck is straight, and the frets have plenty of life left in them. \u2028 The body is solid with no cracks, breaks, or separation. There are a few scratches and wear marks, along with a few dings and dents, which is common for a guitar that is over 60 years old.\u00a0 \u2028 I have tried to show as much in the photos as possible. Please use the magnifier to view them close up. \u2028 Included is the original case shown. \u2028 Shipping is UPS or Fed-Ex, but we sometimes will ship Priority Mail for faster delivery depending on its destination. I am not shipping internationally at this time, and can only ship to addresses within the US. \u2028 Please check my other listings in the coming days.", "ItemID": "223311486116", "EndTime": "2019-01-30T20:11:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T18:59:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-1956-Silvertone-1352-Electric-Archtop-Guitar-Gibson-P-13-Pickup-/223311486116", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Akron, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233114861168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/woUAAOSwrZBcL6xA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O7sAAOSwNXpcL6w6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5Y0AAOSwC45cL6xD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/80IAAOSw651cL6w4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6sEAAOSwFlJcL6w-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RyEAAOSwjQVcL6xI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-T4AAOSwl7dcL6xH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rZ0AAOSwp3dcL6xO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/v0sAAOSws2RcL6xM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oVAAAOSw1rpcL6xK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tHkAAOSw8DpcL6w8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AUAAAOSwG25cL6xF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44321", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "leatherstuff.com", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4645, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 895.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 895.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 69}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rare 1956 Silvertone 1352 Electric Archtop Guitar with a Gibson P-13 Pickup", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Silvertone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["1352"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1956"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 333, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great Playing and Sounding Vintage Guitar made by Harmony", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
