{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Les Paul Gothic 2001 # 01821341 w/ Original Case Excellent Condition! I believe it would be hard to find a Gibson Les Paul Gothic in much better condition than this. The guitar is all stock Gibson as from the Nashville factory. It still has the plastic on the truss rod cover. There are no cracks or scratches. For its age, the guitar's finish is nearly flawless. Why I say nearly flawless is because if you look really close while holding a light at an angle you can see some very faint marks here and there. Most people would probably think I'm crazy for even mentioning them, but I just feel better pointing it out. The original hardshell case is in very good condition. Only shows light wear (from the closet LOL). The finish on the hardware has oxidized some over time. But the inside is as plush as new! The combination lock has never been set. It still has the red pin in it (see picture) with instructions for setting the combination lock. Don't let this rare classic slip away! Gothic rock on!
