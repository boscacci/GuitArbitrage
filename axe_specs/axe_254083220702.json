It is a yellow flame paint job. It has one floating pick-up which is attached to the pick-guard. This guitar does have a crack in the headstock behind the neck. It was like this when I bought it. It was repaired by gluing and clamping.  The crack runs along with the length of headstock and was not severe enough to separate. It has some impressions from a belt on the heel of the neck. I will show in photos. There is an almost invisible crack on the inside of the cutaway 1/8 to 1/4'\" long. It might need minimal fret work. Overall it might need a little work or no work at all depending on the player. The guitar has played great for me for the last 10 years that I've owned it.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
