{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I bought this guitar new from Guitar Center in 2016, and I am the only owner. It has at most about one hour of playing time on it, so it is in near pristine condition - with very few minor scratches which should buff out easily. Includes a new hardshell Ibanez TKLA2218 case. This is one of Gretsch's larger hollowbody guitars, so it has a usable sound unamplified, which is handly for private practice - though of course it is intended to be amplified.

This sonic power is harnessed and shaped by the traditional control layout\u2014neck and bridge pickup volume controls, a master tone control, master volume control and three-way pickup switching. A fast-playing 12\u201d-radius rosewood fingerboard with elegant pearloid block inlays and 22 medium jumbo frets sits atop the white-bound nato neck with a thin \u201cU\u201d-shaped profile\u2014ideal for chord work or firing off speedy riffs.
