{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 2010 Fender Mustang '69 vintage reissue in stunning Candy Apple Red and in perfect working order. Made exclusively for the Japanese market and never meant to be exported, this Mustang (officially model MG69) model is rarely seen outside its country of origin. Often considered to rival Fender's US production in terms of overall quality, this Mustang is a testament to the workmanship and eye for detail evident in the Made in Japan Fender models.There's plenty to love about this Mustang, from the lightweight and resonant body to the pair of stock single coil pickups that deliver plenty of snap and twang. The guitar weighs in at a mere 6lbs 10oz, and the crisp, clear voice of the instrument when strummed acoustically definitely comes through when plugged in as well. Of course one of the most fun sounds on the Mustang is the out of phase setting, engaged when both on/off/on pickup selector switches are at their innermost or outermost points. The quack and spank of that particular setting is unique to the Mustang, and there's plenty of tonal range between the two pickups, with meatier sounds when the neck pickup is soloed. Professionally setup here at Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar, this Mustang is strung with 10-46 strings and slinky, low action.The neck has a very thick and chunky C shaped profile with lots of shoulder and heft, yet despite the fullness of the profile, the nut width is quite slender at only 1 9/16\". The thick veneer rosewood fretboard boasts 22 frets which show only light wear on the crowns beneath the plain strings on frets 1-2 and virtually no wear up the fretboard. At 24\", the scale length is ideal for smaller hands and players looking to execute chord extensions that might be a bit more of a stretch at Fender's full scale. The headstock features Kluson-style tuning machines which turn smoothly and hold pitch as they should.All of the electronics work as they should, with Master Volume and Tone controls governing the two pickups. Cosmetically, this instrument is near mint with a flawless neck profile and only a few minor scuffs on the body, as well as light surface patina on the chrome control plate.
