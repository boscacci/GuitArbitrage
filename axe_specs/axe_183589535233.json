{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I am selling my Nash T-63 because I'm playing more acoustic now and just don't have the time to play it. I am the original owner of the guitar. I purchased it new from Wolfe Guitars in 2012 (original case candy and receipt is included). It's in \"as new\" condition as it was always kept in the original hard shell case (also included) and was only used in my home. The receipt calls the color \"surf green\". The shop that sets up my guitars calls it \"sonic blue\". Whatever the color is called, it looks just like the pictures. Nothing has been changed with the original relic job. It's has an alder wood body, rosewood fretboard, Lollar pickups and a medium C shape neck. It has locking guitar strap buttons on it (original's are included as well), set up for 10's (set of new Boomers included). Packaging will be top notch. Please also check out my other items listed. Please message me with questions.", "ItemID": "183589535233", "EndTime": "2018-12-23T21:52:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-16T21:52:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Nash-T-63-Electric-Guitar-w-OHSC-/183589535233", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chester Springs, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835895352338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HF8AAOSwsGpcFnPz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9jMAAOSwzd9cFngH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iJIAAOSwDaBcFnIR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XasAAOSwpFtcFnNk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4QEAAOSwjkZcFnIR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pvAAAOSwSONcFnIR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RckAAOSwzqtcFnIR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oSkAAOSwjrFcFnLo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HT4AAOSwxJ9cFnLo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aUEAAOSwXitcFpdq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FxMAAOSwPmVcFnLo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "19425", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "profharms", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 145, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1277.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1277.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 327}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Nash T-63 Electric Guitar w/OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Nash"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["T-63"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 364, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1302.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
