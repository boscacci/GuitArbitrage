{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hondo Revival H935 (Gibson ES-335 copy). Very good condition, appears to be a couple of tiny surface touchups on the finish by the heel and back of headstock, but hard to see. Nice action, almost no wear that I can see on the fretboard. In my opinion, this guitar doesn't look like it's been played. Nice binding, original stickers, beautiful color my lousy photos don't do justice to. As much as I'd love to keep this, my guitars have taken over and sacrificing the herd is the only way for me to get the upper hand. Researching this online is a revelation. As it turns out, the H935 is a Holy Grail guitar for a handful of MIJ aficionados, and the star of blogs and videos. Some debate exists as to which models were made in Japan as opposed to Korea. No question this run with the classic open book headstock and Grover tuners was their highest end offering. I am selling this beauty 'As-Is' because the possibility exists there may be some imperfection I don't see, or couldn't catch on camera. Great tone, warm with many variables. Do the investigating yourself, this is a gem.Comes in a stiff, lightweight travel case. Research these legendary Japanese builders who crafted Electra, Epiphone, Yamaha, Aria, Pan, Pearl, Westone, Greco, Vantage, Univox, etc. I do not sell junk, I bought these guitars because I love guitars and list them HONESTLY. If you try to scam me for bad feedback I will not go for it! There are also youtube videos of this model. As with all vintage instruments, ask questions before buying as returns are not accepted. I ship guitars between 3-5 business days, sooner if possible.
