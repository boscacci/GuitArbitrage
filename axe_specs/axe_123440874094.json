{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this 2016 Ibanez RG652AHM Prestige in Nebula Green Burst. Made in Japan. It has mostly been kept at home for recording and practicing. Like any used guitar, there will me some wear on the frets, from normal use, but nothing that will give you any major issues. Frets still have plenty of life in them. The binding looks a bit separated near the 12th fret (which is a common occurrence on guitars with binding, since wood often shrinks and expands due to changes in temperature and humidity). It's something you won't feel at all while playing. * See second to last photo. There's only one small ding on the body that I can see (it's barely noticeable). * See last photo. Other than that, it's a great playing guitar. Plays beautifully. Mods 1. The trem was changed from an Original Edge, to a Lo-Pro Edge, about 4 to 5 months ago (as well as new locking studs). 2. The tremolo block was switched out for a higher quality brass block made by Hantug*Included - Original hardshell case- Tremolo bar w/ extra washers- Back cavity plate and truss rod cover (will be installed before shipping).- Ibanez multi tool- Instruction bookletYear: 2016 Specs: Neck - Super Wizard HP 5 Piece Maple/Walnut Neck Body - AshFretboard - Bound Birdseye Maple Fretboard w/ Black Dot InlaysFrets - Jumbo Frets w/ Prestige Fret Edge TreatmentBridge - Edge Lo-Pro* (Originally, the Ibanez Edge Trem)Neck Pickup - Dimarzio Air NortonBridge Pickup - Dimarzio Tone ZoneHardware Color- Cosmo Black Scale Length - 25 1/2 Free ShippingNo Sales TaxPart of Global Shipping Program Happy Bidding!
