{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Schecter C-1 Diamond Series Guitar Duncan PU Neck Through Sunburst Up for sale we have a Schecter guitar. It\u2019s very clean and has super stylish retro look to it. Way ahead of its time. The guitar plays well, intonation is low. The electronics, switches, picks ups and everything works as it should. Overall the guitar is in very good condition, and there are a handful of random small superficial dings on the entire guitar. Very loud guitar that sounds amazing through any decent amplifier.
