{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a special run model designed by Fender for Guitar Center. These list on the GC website for $624.99. The new models are sold with a Pau Ferro fingerboard, this one has a Rosewood fingerboard. It is a 2014 model, with a solid Alder body and quality Fender parts, pickups and hardware. The plastic was removed from the pickguard and tremolo cover, just before the photos were taken. It has a few scratches and one scuff on the tip of the headstock, which is pictured. The flaws are very minor. It is equipped with 2 single coil pickups in the neck and middle positions, and a Humbucker in the bridge position. The tuners are a nice American Fender quality and the color is Candy Apple Redburst. The color differs slightly from normal Candy Apple, as it is slightly darker on the edges. The frets and fingerboard show minimal play wear, if any. It is a great player, up and down the neck, with easy action and no buzzing. There are no modifications to this Guitar. It is missing the knob to the selector switch, but I will replace it before shipping. Additional information can be found online at GuitarCenter.com. The auction includes a very nice quality RoadRunner gig bag, patch cable and an American made strap. It will ship in a guitar box, insured, via UPS ground to the contiguous U.S. 48 states only.
