{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "PLEASE READ CAREFULLY! I have disclaimers in this description. Epiphone Riviera, not sure of age but it's not an old one, serial number 11021501596. I've had it about 5 years. It has various replacement parts that are not original but appear to be correct for this guitar. Not sure of where it was made, label says \"100% inspected and set up in USA.\" Pickguard is missing, I've shown the screw holes where the pickguard would be attached. Body front, back, and neck are in nice shape. The biggest issue (which has not been an issue thus far) is that the neck has been broken off, which I repaired, and has held fine for years. I included a picture of the wood splines I glued into the neck. Please verify shipping to your zip code, anywhere from $15.22 to $59.64, depending on your location. No case, but will pack very snug and sound. Please ask ANY questions you may have.
