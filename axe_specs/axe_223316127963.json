{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This lefty is tested, is in excellent condition and is ready to be played. It\u2019s setup with 10s and feels pretty good. Fret life is good but could use a cleaning and dressing. (see pics) There are a few nicks but nothing major and only visible in the right light (see pics). I\u2019m also missing the back plate and whammy bar, which are about $10 each to replace. The original flight case (shown) is in very good condition, some scuffs but no cracks. No key Please make sure you ask question before bidding. More pictures available upon request. DETAILS The Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster is a feature loaded Strat with enhanced playability and advanced tonal capabilities. Its contoured heel allows easier access to the upper frets, while the compound radius fretboard and medium jumbo frets make bending effortless. The 2 point Tremolo system has been combined with locking tuners for maximum stability, and the Noiseless pickups deliver classic Strat tone without the annoying hum. The most amazing feature of the American Deluxe Stratocaster is the S-1 switch, secretly hidden in the center of the volume knob, which when engaged delivers 5 new tones (including all 3 pickups on at one time), in addition to the 5 traditional Strat sounds that come standard. If you\u2019re looking for versatility in the form of a Stratocaster, you\u2019ve just found it.
