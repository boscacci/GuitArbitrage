{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Full guitar synth set up. Guitar: Fender MIM GC1 with internal Roland pickup. Upgraded with graph tech string saver saddles and lace sensor RSB pickups. Epiphone gig bag included. GR-55: Guitar synth system. Finish has some Marks and scratches. Works great. Turns your guitar into a keyboard with 1000s of sounds. Both items were gigged with regularly. Guitar is in great shape, minus some buckle rash. GR55 has had beer and sweat drip on it, still works flawlessly. Comes with 13pin cable. You will probably need a new one, getting scratchy when moved around. I replace these often. I've used this as a solo act to loop a full band sound. I've used it in a cover band in place of a keyboard player. Works great for recording.", "ItemID": "163463177286", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T02:01:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-02T02:01:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Roland-Stratocaster-Gr-55-/163463177286", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Gettysburg, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634631772868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jP8AAOSwdxVcIuAD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/il4AAOSwjNdcIuAL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oYIAAOSwvNVcIt~-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EbcAAOSwHSdcIuAA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6xAAAOSw~llcIuAC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nCIAAOSwxoJcIuAW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VvgAAOSwi6dcIuAa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "17325", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "76pensfan76", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 217, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 99}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Roland Stratocaster With Gr-55", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}]}, "HitCount": 103, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
