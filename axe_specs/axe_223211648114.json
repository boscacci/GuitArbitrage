{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Last time for this one. Get it while you can. I don\u2019t mind keeping it. I\u2019ll just put a different guitar up for auction. I need to downsize my collection. Now, you don\u2019t have to pay a lot more money to have all of this work done. You can get that wonderful, Gibson P90 sound right here. Take a look at how much Gibson dogear P90s cost. I\u2019m not sure you can even find a new set. And then add in pots, wiring, switch and jack. 1995 Epi Sorrento, made at the Peerless Plant This one has 2 Gibson USA Dogear P90s, plus all wiring, jack, switch, and pots are US made.\u00a0 Everything else is stock and works like it should. Frets are great with years of life left. Case is a little rough but all the latches work and it certainly protects the guitar.\u00a0 Case included. It still has the key for the locking latch. Just like the Gibson ES 225 or 125! All of the work has been done for you. Just plug in and play. The pickups came from a Gibson ES 330, and they sound fantastic. Gibson P90s really can really growl! They also clean up nicely. There is one mark on it, 3/16\" long and circled in the photo, right above the top left knob.\u00a0 See photo two of the body...left top is all light reflection. It's perfect up there. There are some small surface marks on the back...just normal stuff.\u00a0 Hard to see and nothing even close to going through the finish.\u00a0 The finish is georgous! This guitar is lightweight! It also has a custom pick guard installed.\u00a0 Speed knobs are on it now but the originals will be included. Check out the photos and ask any questions beforehand. I will also include all of the original parts...pickups, chrome covers, wiring, switch, all of that stuff. Auction will be ended, without notice, if guitar sells elsewhere. \u2028Paypal only. \u2028Shipping is $75.00 \u2028This guitar is sold AS IS, and there are no returns.", "ItemID": "223211648114", "EndTime": "2018-11-01T20:21:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-31T11:55:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Sorrento-1995-Peerless-Plant-USA-made-pups-pots-etc-EXCELLENT-/223211648114", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Saint Joseph, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232116481148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/E6UAAOSw2X5byPx3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/Q0wAAOSwKERbyPyA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/RCAAAOSwFu1byPw6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/1VQAAOSwD~FbyPyM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/JIMAAOSwQIFbyPyV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/g9gAAOSww6ZbyPy7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/JpoAAOSwRNhbyPzF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/4gcAAOSwcBRbyPzU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/FsgAAOSwutlbyPze/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/bi8AAOSwXWhbyPzm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/st0AAOSwVx5byPz2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/sAgAAOSwAPtbyPz~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "64506", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "keysz", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 833, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 810}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Sorrento 1995 - Peerless Plant - USA made pups, pots, etc.  EXCELLENT!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1995"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut"]}]}, "HitCount": 44, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
