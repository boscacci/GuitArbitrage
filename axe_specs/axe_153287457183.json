{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "According to the serial # this is either a 74 or 75 from the Kalamazoo facility. I bought this guitar used 20 years ago from Black Market music in San Francisco and that's about all the info I have. The guitar has some wear as pictured in the photos, random nicks and some scratches, theres a dull in the finish towards the bottom top of the guitar that I tried to get a good photo of but was hard to capture. I also tried getting a photo under the pick guard where someone had sanded off the finish is a small circle, I cant imagine why? but it was there when I bought it, and is perfectly hidden by the pick guard, its a small circle, just barely more then an inch, pictured in the second to last photo. It has new 498T/490R Gibson pick ups. And lastly comes with the Gibson hardshell case. All sales final, so if you have any questions drop me a line. Thanks for looking! On Dec-03-18 at 15:47:04 PST, seller added the following information: Please note! When listing this guitar Ebay populated the listing with a general description of a Les Paul, please refer only to my listing regarding specifics of the guitar. For instance the auto populated les paul description notes that all Les Pauls have 57' classic humbuckers, as mentioned in my description this guitar does not have those pick ups, it has new gibson 498t/490r pick ups. I just want to be a clear as possible since there are no returns, Thanks! On Dec-04-18 at 20:59:55 PST, seller added the following information: I just answered a question about the weight of the guitar, I weighed it here at home and it came up 10lbs. Please be certain when bidding, all sales are final! Thanks.
