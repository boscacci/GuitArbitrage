{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2018 Gibson SG Standard: This guitar is super clean as it should be as it is just over one year old. Super light at 6lbs., 4oz. Last year of the small, early '60's style pick guard. New, easy adjust Nashville bridge. Grover locking tuners. 60's slim tapered neck profile. 61R and 61T humbuclers. This guitar has just been set up with 10 gauge strings and is ready to play. No fret wear and just some typical light surface scratched. One weird circular impression tin the clear coat on the body in the armrest area that is very hard to see. Includes original hard shell case as shown, paperwork, tools and case goodies. Guitars can experience slight changes in shipping that may require minor adjustments. In addition, I can not predict how you like your guitar set up. Be advised that minor adjustments or a set-up to your liking may be required and the costs associated with these adjustments should be expected.Under no circumstances will I be responsible for any shipping charges, send or return, unless this item is damaged in shipping. We offer a 48 hour approval period(regardless of what e-bay says). Please feel free to call me between 10:00AM and 6:00PM Eastern time with any questions or for an in hand description or e-mail me with any questions. Shipping is via FEDEX Ground unless you have specific needs which I will try to accommodate. If the shipping comes out significantly less than my cost I will issue a partial refund through Paypal but the shipping carriers have been consistently raising their rates. Generally I ship within 24 hours but I often travel throughout the US to acquire the guitars I offer here on e-bay so there will be times that shipments may be delayed for a few days. If there is going to be a delay I will notify you.", "ItemID": "362534908767", "EndTime": "2019-01-24T12:37:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T17:06:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-Gibson-SG-Standard-USA-Made-Gloss-Finish-Case-LIGHT-WEIGHT-/362534908767", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Syosset, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3625349087678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QI8AAOSwVXdcP2Os/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BnoAAOSwj5BcP2O3/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xNoAAOSw7wFcP2PD/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PDkAAOSwr~JcP2PK/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y0gAAOSwSe5cP2PU/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0MsAAOSwEVlcP2Pg/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NBwAAOSwEwhcP2Pj/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cZsAAOSwkAxcP2Po/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PFcAAOSwr~JcP2Pr/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q~IAAOSwKL5cP2Pv/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/edUAAOSw~slcP2P1/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11791", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mygenerationguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3152, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 310}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2018 Gibson SG Standard, USA Made, Gloss Finish, with Case, LIGHT WEIGHT!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Standard"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 102, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=115572547", "StoreName": "My Generation Guitars"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
