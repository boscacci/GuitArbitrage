{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a re-listing. The other listing had listing errors that forced me to shut it down. I apologize to the people bidding, but I couldn\u2019t in good faith, continue the sale with errors of my ignorance. I\u2019m new to selling on eBay and when listing an item, Ebay likes to compare to other items being sold. I didn\u2019t know they took so much info from other listings to add to yours, I thought it was just part of their price comparison. Anyway..... I bought this guitar with full intent on learning how to play, but for circumstances beyond my control, I have to sell. I would say the guitar is in 9/10 condition. I had it tuned up with new strings at George\u2019s Music and it\u2019s sat in its case for the past several months, I never even attempted to play it. The case does come with the guitar, I don\u2019t know what to say about the case. It zips closed and will be clean of debris when shipped. It will also some with new shoulder strap, amp wire and picks. Please feel free to message me for extra, or more detailed pictures or any questions. ** The amp in the picture does NOT come with the guitar. It is, at the time of this posting, up for bids in my other listings. If you don\u2019t see it, it\u2019s been sold. **", "ItemID": "264078957197", "EndTime": "2018-12-15T12:13:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-08T12:13:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Schecter-Damien-Elite-Electric-Guitar-Excellent-Condition-New-Strings-/264078957197", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640789571978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODg=/z/nlYAAOSwO-hcC7W6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODg=/z/fOsAAOSwiwZcC7W8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/3pAAAOSwn01cC7W7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0oQAAOSw~bhcC7XA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eioAAOSwBVdcC7XC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8B0AAOSw-BlcC7W~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GzgAAOSw-V1cC7XF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X-wAAOSwt3hcC7W-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1QAAAOSwOWdcC7XD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WQcAAOSweWdcC7XG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "19018", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mcza1550", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 134, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 27, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 246.64, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 246.64, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2432}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Schecter Damien Elite Electric Guitar.
