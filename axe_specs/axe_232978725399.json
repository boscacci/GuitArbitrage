{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a solid Cherry wood one of a kind custom guitar body and neck with a Granadillo Fret board. Ganadillo is known as \"the wood that sings\" and is a beautiful reddish brown color and is very dense, The fretboard has a 10 degree radius and has a standard nut slot with nut included. Jumbo frets installed. The neck is like a \"chunky C\" shape with a thicker fretboard for stability. There are no position markers on top of the fretboard, they are on the side and are white Maple (please see last picture). Lately I have seen some guitars without position markers on the fretboard so I thought someone would like that so, here you go.If you look closely at the top of the neck ( picture 3 ) near the headstock, the grain pattern in the fretboard actually looks like a bird, it is one of a kind .Molded after the PRS style double cutaway, Stratocaster guitar. The auction is for ---- body, neck, and control cover, two 500k Alpha potentiometers, one 3 way switch, input jack with electrosocket your choice of bridge, hardtail or tune-o-matic type, 6 tuning machines, Hardware is chrome. (I will send a you a picture of the hardware package, just ask) I ran out of picture room on the ebay ad.The neck pocket is a set neck style (glue in) ***** SEE PHOTOS****** and the fit is straight and true ( see picture with laser). I put a lot of pictures of the neck and body joint so you can see it is ok. If you like building your own, this is a really good start, all the hard work is done, routed neck pocket, double humbucker route and rear control cavity route are already done. Holes for wire runs are done and holes for treble, volume and 3 way switch are done, the jack hole is also cut. Comes with a custom cavity cover that has been painted with black primer on the inside and left raw on the outside.Frets installed, I will include a nut, not installed (they always seem to get lost) it will be tapped to the neck. They frets are very, very close, but may need a small level job, Truss rod a-ok. *************I also know shipping is expensive and will only charge what it costs me to ship it. Any overcharges will be refunded to you. I have sanded most of it down to 150 grit so you will need to do some finish sanding and actual finish coat applications of urethane, lacquer, Danish oil or whatever you decide. I have another guitar (telecaster) that is made exactly the same way, it sounds and looks awesome! if you want to see what it would look like finished, just email and I will send you a pic. Please look at the pictures carefully and if you have any questions or need more pictures of the body or neck, please ask before auctions end, I will try to get you what you need. I want you to be satisfied with your purchase. Please make sure you know what you are purchasing, that is why I include so many photos and lots of info in the description. I normally do not take returns but, when you receive it, if you really don't like it, you can send it back at your cost, for a full refund, no questions asked. It really is a one of a kind instrument.
