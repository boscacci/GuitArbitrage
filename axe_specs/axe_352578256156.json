{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a \u201891 Midnight Wine colored Fender Stratocaster. It has plenty of small dings and scratches as well as paint crack near the neck. However, I've recently had it professionally set up and it still plays very well. The action is low. All POTs, pickups, and electrical wiring have been tested and found to be working just fine. Currently there are .09s strung on the guitar. It will be packed carefully and shipped via USPS ground. No returns. Many apologies to previous watchers/bidders. I've posted this guitar on eBay many times but have had cold feet about selling it, and subsequently removed the listing. I've finally come to terms with letting it go. It's a great guitar, and deserves to go to a good home and be played. I'm pricing it to sell. Bid with confidence, I will not be removing this listing.\u00a0 Will not ship internationally.", "ItemID": "352578256156", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T00:28:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T00:28:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-MIM-Midnight-Wine-1991-Rosewood-Fretboard-/352578256156", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Elk Grove, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525782561568080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/eTgAAOSwg-tcJcP3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/1-AAAOSw-rxcJcP6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/YUIAAOSwYKdcJcP8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/8kgAAOSwIbtcJcP7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/Ce8AAOSw~JFcJcP5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/cAcAAOSw11BcJcP7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/g6wAAOSwqnlcJcP3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/mfkAAOSwNe9cJcP6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/iykAAOSwH1pcJcP4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/MjsAAOSwX6RcJcP5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "95757", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dangitsthechus", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 16, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 379.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 379.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster MIM, Midnight Wine 1991, Rosewood Fretboard", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Rosewood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1991"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}]}, "HitCount": 365, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 384.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
