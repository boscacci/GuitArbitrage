{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is what Guitar Fetish website says about this guitar: XV-830 Fiesta Red Solid Alder Body Maple F/B Humbucker Kwikplug Equipped The ULTIMATE Tele Upgrade!We've taken a great SOLID ALDER body with SOLID Hard Rock Maple neck with matching Maple or Rosewood fingerboard...cut to perfect vintage specs and given it some real Horsepower!We've installed a pair of HOT GFS LIl Puncher Humbucker pickups, Kwikplug equipped, and a matching Kwikplug coil-split harness. Now you have the Best Of Both Worlds! Hard Rocking KPT15 Bridge pickup- wound FAT and STRONG at 15k!! We've put the sweet and vintage sounding KTP23 in the neck- wound to sound authentic at 5.5K. This pair covers ALL the classic rock stuff and has enough grind to cop all the modern metal stuff too!. We've installed the Kwikplug KPW06 Tele Humbucker Coil Split harness. This not only gives you the full Humbucker experience AND the full coil-split single coil sound by simply pulling up on the tone control, but it taps the INNER coils, so in the \"in-between\" position the sound is fat and sweet and NOISE CANCELLING!We didn't stop at the pickup, we've installed a hand cut Genuine Graphtech \"NuBone\" nut, Upgraded tuning machines and a correct vintage \"Ashtray\" style bridge.The XV-830 takes the classic single cutaway guitar to a whole new level of quality and value. NEVER has there been a guitar at this price with this level of playability, hand craftsmanship and amplified tone.The XV-830 is finished in super hard, super thin, super light Catalyzed Urethane, hand buffed to a deafening gloss. PLEASE don't compare these to other sub $200 guitars- compare them to the BEST out there.The neck is finished in a nice clear SATIN finish- feels great to play- 21 medium jumbo frets make upper access a snap... It is a great guitar and is in fantastic condition. Just thinning down my herd and I am keeping my jazz guitarsLots of power in the pickups and dead quiet in Humbucker mode. I updated the saddles to brass. I can also add a nice rectangular case for an extra $40.00.
