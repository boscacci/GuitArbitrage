{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Kalamazoo KG-1 \u201cjaguar\u201d style body in antique white lacquer finish is equipped with a maestro vibrola tailpiece and aftermarket \u201cvibrato\u201d arm. The Kalamazoo line was made by Gibson in the USA during the mid-1960s to compete with entry level imported solid body electrics. Guitars featured an MDF (Masonite) body and a maple neck with rosewood fretboard. The original single coil pickup was removed by a previous owner (not included or available) and replaced with a contemporary Seymour Duncan \u2018lil 59 humbucker the function of which is split with a mini-toggle between the VT pots. To accommodate the SD pickup footprint, the original pickguard was modified and damaged slightly (see photos). The original capacitor was replaced with a Sprague orange drop and the lower body strap anchor button looks like it has been replaced. Beyond those modifications, the guitar is as original (tuners, truss rod cover, nut, neck plate, other strap anchor button, bridge and studs, tailpiece, pots and knobs, jack). Cosmetically, the guitar is in very good condition with a few bumps and bruises and finish scrapes along the rear lower body edge (see photo) but no structural damage or repairs. The neck is straight and the frets only slightly worn. The guitar works and plays great; light and a lot of fun. Range of lateral motion for the flush-mounted vibrato arm is limited a bit by the nearby knobs, but the arm is still very functional. The arm could easily be replaced with a period or aftermarket vibrola arm that would address this issue. A non-original period chipboard case in fair/working but slightly damaged condition is included. If the shipping cost is less than $35, I will refund the difference. A full refund provided with no questions asked. I will return 100% of bid price + 50% of return shipping after the guitar is returned. Yes, this means the buyer takes a small risk (50% of return shipping) when bidding on this guitar. No partial refunds.", "ItemID": "323523917430", "EndTime": "2018-11-04T02:30:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-30T02:30:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kalamazoo-KG-1-vintage-electric-guitar-/323523917430", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bridgeton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235239174308080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4N1gxNjAw/z/2eAAAOSwHORb1wHA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDIz/z/viIAAOSwlKRb1wHT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI1NFgxNjAw/z/ZDkAAOSwZ1hb1wHg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyNlgxNjAw/z/ELoAAOSw9GVb1wHv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExOVgxNjAw/z/V8gAAOSwW~pb1wH9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2M1gxNjAw/z/K0oAAOSw5Qtb1wIL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyOFgxNjAw/z/jykAAOSweXFb1wIa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5MVgxNjAw/z/jJ4AAOSwvO5b1wIj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MeoAAOSw-eJb1wI5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6-4AAOSwv1db1wJH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE3NFgxNjAw/z/s8QAAOSw1Sdb1wJb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08302", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "orton0231", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1141, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 24}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Kalamazoo KG-1 vintage electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Masonite"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Kalamazoo"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["KG-1"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 153, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 233.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
