{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Greetings, Relisted (sigh again!) for genuine reasons and now available a classic players grade 12 string from the Eko stable, circa 1969. This is the solid, disaster-proof, original Ranger model with the nice black on white sci-fi looking 'bubble' logo on the headstock and the older style and very attractive burled mahogany body, made in Recanati, Italy. The old stager has seen some action on her tour of duty, recently stopped by our place for a travellers rest and some TLC and now its over to you. So, there are some good things about this guitar, I shall start with the not so good...... There are some small cosmetic repairs in the lacquer and some lacquer lines on the soundboard which are cracks in the varnish lacquer that is common to see in these models, we have sealed these but not refinished them. Also there is a historical repair to the neck where some cracks both in the wood and in the lacquer have been restored - this is a very solid repair and does not affect the working surface of the neck, barely noticeable to the touch, not the prettiest yet nothing to put a player off. Hence this is being described a players grade guitar, and a great guitar if you can man up to it, or woman up to it! Should be able to woman up to things in the 21st century I say!! Anyhow, now fully overhauled and professionally set up she plays with a low action, straight neck, new D'Addario quality strings and is a generally fine guitar, more than ready for take two.
