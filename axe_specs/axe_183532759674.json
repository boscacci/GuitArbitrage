{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for your consideration is a 2003 Rickenbacker 325 c58 guitar. There were not very many of these produced, so finding one is pretty rare these days. This particular guitar is all original, but has an actual 1958 Rickenbacker case, so the case is vintage and works fine with a few repaired latches, etc...The guitar is one of the better ones you will find. This one has a trapeze tailpiece on it as a replacement to the Kaufman. It just slides over the original brackets and is 100% reversible and I am including the original Kaufman vibrato. The neck is dead straight and has no issues. I took a good pic to show the neck. Also, there is no lifting of the neck either, so this is a healthy guitar. Frets are very nice, no grooves and plenty of wear left. There are very minimal poly scratches that are not visible in person unless under a critical light, so overall, I would give this a 9.5/10 on the finish and structure. In case you are not familiar with this model, it is fully hollow, made of Alder, neck and body...ALDER. 5lbs in total weight, so it is super light, super resonant and the pickups are original 5ohm wound single-coils that sound beautiful! The wiring and knobs are like original in that they turn backwards from normal modern guitars...Everything works as it should and it plays great. It has never been gigged, just used in my studio at home and for the most part has remained in it\u2019s case and shown to other musicians and things like that. This is the first Ric Lennon owned prior to his c64, also known as the Hamburg Ric I believe. Please send me any questions you may have.
