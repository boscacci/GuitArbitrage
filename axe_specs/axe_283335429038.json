{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Really nice Ibanez that's barely used, does not include case or bag, I do ship promptly with real guitar boxes and well packed. Other: Made for speed, fury, and expression. If Ibanez can lay claim to the title of being the strongest name in Metal guitars, then the RGA is the model this reputation was built on. Every inch of this classic screams speed, fury, and expression. The RGAT62 is a hardtail 6-string electric built around a Mahogany body wing body. Its contoured top not only looks sleek\u2014it creates a softer, more comfortable edge where the player\u2019s right forearm rests. The Wizard III 5pc Maple/ Walnut through constructed neck feature jumbo frets and a Rosewood fretboard that not only provides optimal articulation, but enhances playing speed as well. This neck and fretboard combination provides a smooth, inviting playing surface and contributes to the RGAT62\u2019s warm, well-defined tonality. DiMarzio Air Norton and The Tone Zone pickups were chosen for the inspiring way they complement each other to create a wide pallet of tonal options that add fire and improve sustain, yet retain clarity. Wired through a 5-way selector switch, they can be combined in a variety of configurations that offer numerous tonal options. A simple, yet solid fixed bridge provides stable, dependable tuning and accurate intonation. Case sold separately.
