{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Thank you for checking out my Squire 51' guitar. I bought this guitar new and rarely played it. It is completely original and has never been modified. It is made in Indonesia and is NOT from the Pawn Shop series that came later. I set it up when I received it and it still plays great. It has a coil splitter for the bridge humbucker and you can get some pretty good Tele tones out of it. The single coil neck pickup give a nice Tele/Strat sound. Frets do not show any wear. I will include a used gig bag that has a tear along the top seam and will pack securely. You will not be disappointed with this one. Buyer pays FedEx shipping and a signature will be required. Please ask all questions before bidding. UPDATE: 11-28-18 - Relisting this guitar because the previous bidder was unable to complete the auction. Guitar is already packed and ready to ship. Buy it now is what the highest bid was. Thanks and Happy Holidays.", "ItemID": "332909784085", "EndTime": "2018-12-05T19:20:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-28T19:20:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squire-51-Guitar-Vintage-Blonde-Maple-Neck-No-Reserve-No-Start-Bid-/332909784085", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bristol, Rhode Island", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329097840858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg0OTE=/z/D5wAAOSw20Zb6Y~4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/d4wAAOSwWH1b6Y-1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/YjcAAOSwUMBb6Y-6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/3sUAAOSwiE1b6Y~A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Fp0AAOSwRK9b6Y~H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/oZgAAOSwRbJb6Y~N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/v7AAAOSwpwBb6Y~R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/P34AAOSwIAJb6Y~W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/IlYAAOSwcapb6Y~c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "02809", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "davecast", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 80, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 22, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 172.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 172.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 954}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squire 51 Guitar in Vintage Blonde - Maple Neck - No Reserve No Start Bid", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["51'"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 315, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent Condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
