{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a USA made Ernie Ball Music Man John Petrucci \u2018mystic dream Paint job\u2019 JP7 With PIEZO electric guitar with the John Petrucci hard case. It\u2019s easy to play and sounds great but I just haven\u2019t been playing heavy music lately. This guitar has lots of dings and chips in the paint. The guitar is in fair/poor condition but works great. It is loaded with dimarzio pickups and the piezo system. There are lots of indentations on the body and a rather large chip on the back edge. Please zoom into the pictures. This is definitely not a showroom piece but you won\u2019t stress bringing it to a gig or practice. There are two screw holes where a midi pickup was once installed just north of the bridge. There are lots of dings, chips scratches and cracks in the paint, including near the neck joint (just in the paint finish not the wood - pretty common on contours). One of the volume knobs is not the original. The neck is in good condition with very minimal fret wear. There is ding on the edge of the headstock. I would rate this guitar at a 5/10 condition but the important features are intact like great sound, nice fingerboard/frets and a nice neck. the case has the normal scratches and a little rust on the latches. Shipping price includes insurance. Please check out my other auctions for more guitars, pedals and amps. I\u2019m thinning the herd. Bid with confidence, I have 100% positive feedback", "ItemID": "223337648712", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T02:22:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T22:36:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EBMM-John-Petrucci-JP-7-String-JP7-PIEZO-Ernie-Ball-Music-Man-7string-Guitar-/223337648712", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Port Charlotte, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233376487128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jxYAAOSwRWZb8e4j/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GQ0AAOSwolpb8e4p/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4SoAAOSwAzxb8e4k/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ILQAAOSwI01b8e4s/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NTg=/z/EeUAAOSwIddb8e4h/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RdoAAOSwEYpb8e4x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wSUAAOSw29Jb8e4m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9QkAAOSw5wFb8e4v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JD0AAOSwSlpb8e4u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hHkAAOSwnh5b8e4y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i4UAAOSw5Xpb8e4r/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/s0oAAOSw4sNb8e4o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33954", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bobsegur3", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1604, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 61}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EBMM John Petrucci JP 7 String JP7 PIEZO Ernie Ball Music Man 7string Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Music Man"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JP7"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 135, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Jp7 piezo mystic dream with Petrucci case.
