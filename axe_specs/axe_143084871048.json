{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For those of you who don't know, Heritage guitars formed in 1985 when Gibson left their factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The still hand make their guitars there. This is a seriously cool silverburst flame top. The pictures really don't do it justice. It comes with the original hardshell case. I am not the original owner, but I believe everything is stock on it. It was sold to me as an H150, but I believe that it is an H140. I think the H140s came with dot inlays and had the option for the belly cut. Pros \u2022Amazing flame maple top in Silverburst finish \u2022Sounds great (I believe it has Seymour Duncan pickups) \u2022Gut cut aka Belly cut \u2022Schaller tuners Cons \u2022a couple of cosmetic issues (pics 6 & 7) Please feel free to ask questions.
