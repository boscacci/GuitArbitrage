The headstock also features the inlaid Gibson logo and crown inlaid in pearl and a 2016 truss rod cover indicating that this guitar has the features of the current production version. Other unique features include gold Grover tuners, rosewood bridge and the signature Songwriter tortoise pattern pick guard.
