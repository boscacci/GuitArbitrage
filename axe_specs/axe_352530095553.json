{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Serial Number: MZ3 090306 So I believe this guitar is a 2003-2004 model after researching the serial number on the Internet The guitar has definitely been used by a player and looks to have been taken out on gigs If you look closely you'll notice some small nicks, scuffs and scratches here and there,, please see pictures The clear plastic on the pick guard is peeling and shows wear,, I think the clear plastic can be pulled off All of the chrome body hardware and screws show either rusting and or pitting The back cover plate is missing, please see pictures The guitar is missing a string The tremolo bridge is in a floating position and will need to be adjusted, unless the new owner desires a floating tremolo I have found the original tremolo bar and it is included My friend who plays guitar tested it out and this is what he told me: The guitar plays great BUT<<<<< The new owner will need to give it a general maintenance set up to their playing specifications Also give it a thorough cleaning and polish And he thinks the tremolo bridge should be in a fixed down position Comes with a generic gig bag My pictures represent how this guitar looks on display from 3' feet away in a well lit room Shipping weight is between 11 and 12 pounds", "ItemID": "352530095553", "EndTime": "2018-12-06T00:27:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-29T00:27:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar-MIM-Mexican-Made-Mexico-2003-2004-/352530095553", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Waterford Works, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525300955538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2Njg=/z/t4kAAOSwK1Rb~yvF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5OTg=/z/QoAAAOSwJ~5b~yvJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTY5/z/-LwAAOSwgnJb~yvM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MzA=/z/rDwAAOSwF7lb~yvN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MzA=/z/hiUAAOSwx9lb~yvV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NjM=/z/WQIAAOSwzcNb~yvX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4OTk=/z/ABIAAOSwwPdb~yvZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjA5/z/R58AAOSwxFVb~yvb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2Njg=/z/cUwAAOSwXi9b~yv7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "08089", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "superdupersuperstore", "FeedbackRatingStar": "YellowShooting", "FeedbackScore": 17126, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 10, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 231}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster Electric Guitar MIM Mexican Made in Mexico 2003-2004 ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 1131, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=128565699", "StoreName": "Super Duper Super Store"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
