{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Custom Shop 1970 Reissue Jaguar Journeyman Relic Sunburst 2017 . This guitar is in perfect shape as when new. It has not been out of the house. It has an aged body with beautiful checking and some light relic marks. The neck is as new and has a really nice thick profile closer to a 1958-59 Les Paul. A really great guitar. I am letting it go due to needing funds for a vehicle build. Feel free to as questions. This was a msrp of $3900 new.
