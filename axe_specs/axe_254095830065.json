{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling a very rare 1996 10th Anniversary Ibanez Jem; I believe there were only 210 of them released in the USA. This particular edition of the Jem is very desirable among collectors as it is harder to find for obvious reasons. The guitar was my brother's, however, he recently passed. The guitar has been kept in the case most of it's lifespan. The two more significant blemishes I took photos of, one chip on the bottom contour near the input jack, and another small ding along the contour of the body. It has some surface scratches from general use but is in great shape otherwise as you can see in the pictures. The guitar is all original and has not been modified in anyway. If you have any questions or want me to take any more pics just let me know, I'd be happy to.
