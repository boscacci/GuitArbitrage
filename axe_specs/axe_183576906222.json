{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Guild Newark St. Collection S-200 T-Bird Includes a Guild Padded Gigbag Have Questions? Send us a message and we will be glad to help you! An exact replica of the original version The S-200 TBird is one of Guild's most iconic, uniquely recognizable guitars. This reissue is an exact replica of the original versions produced between 1964 and 1968, featuring an asymmetrical all mahogany body sure to catch the eye of the guitarist looking to blaze his or her own trail. However, this guitar\u2019s appeal isn\u2019t just about its looks \u2013 its unique controls create the widest array of tones offered on any Guild instrument, drawing on its dual Guild LB-1 Little Bucker pickups to achieve almost every conceivable color on the palette. The LB-1s are replicas of Guild\u2019s original humbuckers, offering an array of tones from sparkly clean single coil-esque spank to thick and warm humbucker sounds that fatten and sing when driven. Switching capabilities include rhythm or lead modes, pickup on/off, and standard volume and tone controls. When engaged, an optional tone capacitor creates single-coil tones while maintaining the hum-free reliability of the LB-1s. The TBird also features the Hagstrom Vintage Tremar, a reissue of the vibrato system that is considered the crown jewel of many Guild solid body electric models from the 1960s. Along with the authenticity of the Hagstrom Vintage Tremar as a historic Guild feature, this reissue includes mechanical refinements such as fully adjustable spring tension for a user-customizable feel and pitch range, and a locking trem arm for optimal security. The TBird features a vintage C shape set mahogany neck and bound rosewood fingerboard with pearloid block inlays. Other period-correct details include open gear vintage tuning machines, and famed asymmetrical headstock adorned with Guild\u2019s logo and mother-of-pearl Thunderbird icon. The S-200 TBird Includes Guild\u2019s deluxe padded gig bag.
