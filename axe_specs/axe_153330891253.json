{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar is in great condition - normal wear and tear, and it hasn't really been played since I had the factory re-set it up a couple years ago when I had them replace the jack assembly. The case is also in good shape, though I've had to spray paint over a stencil (I used to travel with this guitar occasionally). The John Petrucci JPXI-7 7-String Electric Guitar features a combination of top appointments from JPX and BFR Petrucci signature instruments. Most notably, the JPXI neck has been streamlined to a symmetric, extra slim profile featuring a flatter 20\" radius, medium jumbo stainless steel frets with a finished mahogany neck and an ebony fingerboard. Combined with a solid alder body, mahogany tone block and maple top, the JPXI has become the ultimate rock machine. Similar to that of the JP BFR line, controls include two three-way toggles perfectly wired for the Custom Dimarzio LiquiFire and Crunch Lab humbuckers, in addition to a redesigned Wide-Spread Pivot tremolo with a Music Man/Fishman piezo system bridge pickup. The JPXI guitar is adorned with chrome hardware, mother of pearl inlays and a new onyx finish.
