Great sounding, great looking and feeling and made in the United States. \u2022 Maple neck with \"C\" profile and \"large\" headstock \u2022 Three Texas Special single-coil Stratocaster pickups \u2022 Five-way pickup switch \u2022 Greasebucket tone circuit (rolls off highs without adding bass) \u2022 Vintage-style synchronized tremolo bridge Vintage-style Bridge The vintage-style synchronized tremolo bridge on this American Special Stratocaster imparts classic style and tone, with narrower saddles that allow more comfortable string spacing.Greasebucket Tone Circuit The tone-control electronics in this American Special guitar include Fender's Greasebucket tone circuit. When dialing down the tone knobs, this circuitry rolls off high end without creating additional emphasis on bass. That keeps the tone from getting muddy and it helps create sparkling clean tone and great overdriven sounds too.Gloss Urethane Finish The shiny gloss urethane finish on American Special instruments imparts a beautifully glassy sheen and especially vivid color in a highly durable coating that effectively resists the ravages of weather, aging and fading.Jumbo frets The largest of the fret sizes, jumbo frets are tall and wide, which lets you get a better grip on the strings, enabling more control over them and making bends and vibrato easier. A good choice for players with larger hands and thicker fingers.Modern neck with \"C\" profile and satin back finish American Special guitars feature a modern neck designed for comfort and performance, with a contemporary \"C\"-shaped profile (the shape of the neck in cross section) and a smooth satin finish. Ideal for those who play with the thumb on the back or side of the neck.Texas Special Pickups Single-coil Texas Special pickups are over-wound for big Texas-blues tone with dynamically scorching output. With alnico 5 magnets, enamel-coated magnet wire and staggered pole pieces for balanced output across each string, they sing, scream and everything in between with tight bass, focused midrange and crystalline highs.What's in the box:", "ItemID": "202576303121", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T05:14:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T00:35:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-American-Special-Stratocaster-2018-Mystic-Seafoam-/202576303121", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Old Bethpage, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025763031218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gIUAAOSwM5tcN2UE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~b4AAOSwCEhcN2UU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cs4AAOSwDaBcN2Um/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PsQAAOSwi6dcN2U6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e9QAAOSw2bFcN2VM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ha0AAOSwJaxcN2Vd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yckAAOSwxHlcNoF1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0ZAAAOSw4SxcN9RL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tSUAAOSwHF1cOgGx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11804", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jscotti-half", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 107, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 968}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender American Special Stratocaster 2018 Mystic Seafoam", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["American Special Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}]}, "HitCount": 179, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint .
