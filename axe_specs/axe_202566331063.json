{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered for your consideration from my personal collection is this 1998 DeArmond by Guild (which, as you probably know, Guild is owned by Fender Musical Instrument Corporation) with the original hard-shell case. (Note: Although the length and width of the guitar are substantially the same as that of a Les Paul, with the DeArmond Bigsby a/k/a \u201cDigsby\u201d, the standard Gibson case is not deep enough so having the OHSC is important.) The guitar is in outstanding condition. Frets are in great condition. There have been several upgrades made to the guitar: TV Jones pickups, Schlerter tuning machines, Stew-Mac roller bridge, USA wiring with treble bleed on bridge pickup, Tusq XL nut, and satin neck for fast playing. All work done by a professional guitar tech.
