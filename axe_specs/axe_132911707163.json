{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a late 1960\u2019s Melody maker SG. It is a playable project. The guitar appears to have been refinished the Gibson logo and serial number appear to have been taped off and refinished around. The tuning machines appear to be original. The electronics work correctly but appear to have all been replaced. The pickups are fender noiseless and do not fit the pick guard holes. They are held in by masking tape. The tremelo appears to be a newer reproduction. The bridge appears to have been replaced as well. All that being said the action is ok and this guitar can be played. It is being sold as is. Please ask questions. Pickguard is missing some screws.", "ItemID": "132911707163", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T22:41:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T22:41:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Late-1960-s-Gibson-melody-maker-SG-project-/132911707163", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Shawnee, Kansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329117071638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6jkAAOSwRfxcM9G~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9gEAAOSwf1xcM9G4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FPsAAOSwFlJcM9Gq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/axoAAOSwsO5cM9G8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NCcAAOSw11BcM9Gn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-Z4AAOSw8a9cM9Gq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YFEAAOSwg-tcM9Gq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KpcAAOSwJb5cM9HA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "66216", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jaklon313", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 26, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "w***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 470}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Late 1960\u2019s Gibson melody maker SG project", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Melody Maker"]}]}, "HitCount": 509, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
