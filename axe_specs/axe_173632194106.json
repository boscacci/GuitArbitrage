{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For your consideration is a barely used WR7 from Jackson. Guitar has low miles on it, biggest ding is on the backside of the body...it's on one of the wings...rather small. Plays well and sounds killer. Capitol Guitars is an authorized Jackson dealer. We are fortunate to be the first dealer in line to receive the 2018 Jackson product line. ORDER WITH US TO GET YOUR GUITAR FASTER THAN ORDERING ANY PLACE ELSE! Please contact us with any questions. Over the last decade, Boston-based act Revocation has firmly established itself as one of the finest in today\u2019s death metal and thrash metal genres. Heralded as one of modern metal\u2019s elite guitarists, frontman Dave Davidson is also the driving force behind the band as it continues to evolve and challenge conventional metal norms. Jackson continues its storied history of working with the best in the business with the creation of Davidson\u2019s Pro Series Signature Warrior\u2122 WR7 model, an instrument built for taking creative liberties and running the metal gamut. Davidson\u2019s take on Jackson\u2019s revered angular shape is in a 7-string form featuring a 25.5\u201d scale length, mahogany body with ash top and one-piece through-body maple neck with graphite reinforcement and scarf joint, providing the utmost stability against the rigors and ravages of the road. The oiled neck back finish allows for smooth playing feel, while its 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets is designed for highly technical lightspeed playing\u2014more curved by the nut for comfortable chording, it flattens out as you move up the neck for increasingly fast playing speed and wide bends without fretting out. To meet Revocation\u2019s propensity for building rich, complex chord voicings, Davidson teamed with DiMarzio\u00ae to create his own signature Imperium pickups, which power this signature Pro Series axe with dynamic tone and punchy clarity. Designed so that all notes ring through, from full-bodied, tight low end while using high gain amps to crystal clear cleans on nondistorted channels, these pickups are also highly responsive to harmonics. This axe also features a single tone control, a single volume control with push/pull coil split for single-coil tone and a three-way toggle switch. Dive-bomb or flutter at will with the Floyd Rose\u00ae FRT 1000 series doublelocking tremolo bridge system, recessed for pick hand comfort and providing superior string stability, sustain and dynamic tremolo action. Dark and menacing with its Distressed Ash finish, black body, neck and headstock binding and black hardware, this signature Warrior is primed and ready for battle. \u2022 25.5\u201d scale length \u2022 Mahogany body with ash top \u2022 One-piece through-body maple neck with graphite reinforcement and scarf joint \u2022 Oiled neck back finish \u2022 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets and pearloid piranha tooth inlays \u2022 DiMarzio\u00ae Dave Davidson Signature Imperium Bridge Pickup and DiMarzio Dave Davidson Signature Imperium Neck Pickup \u2022 Single volume (push/pull coil split) and tone controls, plus three-way toggle switch \u2022 Recessed Floyd Rose\u00ae FRT-SSO2000 double-locking tremolo bridge system \u2022 Dunlop\u00ae dual-locking strap buttons \u2022 Available in Distressed Ash with black hardware and black body, neck and headstock binding \u2022 Jackson pointed 7-in-line headstock Series: Pro Series Body Material: Mahogany with Ash Top Body Finish: Satin Neck: 1-Piece Maple Neck-Through-Body with Graphite Reinforcement and Scarf Joint Neck Finish: Oiled Fingerboard: Ebony, 12\u201d - 16\u201d Compound Radius (304.8 mm to 406.4 mm) Frets: 24, Jumbo Position Inlays: Pearloid Piranha Tooth (Small Sharkfin) Nut (Material/Width): Floyd Rose\u00ae Locking, 1.875\u201d (47.6 mm) Tuning Machines: Jackson\u00ae-Branded Sealed Die-Cast Scale Length: 25.5\u201d (648 mm) Bridge: Floyd Rose\u00ae FRT-SSO2000 Double-Locking Tremolo (Recessed) Pickguard: None Pickups: DiMarzio\u00ae Dave Davidson Signature Imperium (Bridge and Neck) Controls: Volume (Push/Pull Coil-Split), Tone Control Knobs: Dome Style Hardware Finish: Black WE SHIP FAST!
