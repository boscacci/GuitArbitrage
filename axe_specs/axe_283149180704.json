{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello Everyone, This listing is for my 2016 Gibson Les Paul Gothic Studio in satin black. This is NOT the Gothic Morte with the black dyed soft Obeche board...this LP has the very hard Richlite fingerboard...just like the Les Paul Custom. Now that you know which \"Gothic\" LP this is, here's a few things about it. She originally came with Gibson Dirty Finger Plus pickups; however, those were removed and replaced with the EMG 81/85 set with quick connects...I do not have the original pickups. The knobs were swapped out for reflector knobs...my personal favorite. Loxx strap lock system was installed...the needed hardware is included along with the \"key\" to attach the buttons to the strap. You have the black chrome hardware and the Grover tuners. She weighs in around 8 pounds 3 ounces...so fairly light for a Les Paul. Mahogany back and neck with maple top and a Richlite fretboard...just like the Custom Shops. I like not having binding on this one...just makes the fingerboard feel wider when the frets run to the end. The Richlite fingerboard is great...no need to oil...doesn't change with humidity (great in dry/humid areas)...looks like ebony and is super slick to play on. The neck is not 60's thin and is just a little thicker than a usual Studio neck...this should allow the LP to easily handle a heavier string gauge for maximum tone. The LP has minor play wear and on these matte finishes, you will see where your arm was rubbing and whatnot, so just be aware everytime you touch this thing you are going to be leaving little marks on it...but that's what makes it cool. The EMG 81/85 set is the \"Zakk Wylde\" set...so you know what they do...heavy metal but also great for cleans and everything in between...but it does run on a battery in the control cavity. The original owner installed these pickups; however, he used the \"short shaft pots\"...EMG has the longer shaft pots for Les Pauls; however, he did not use them and I do not have any quick connect long shafts laying around. The short pots are \"ok\"...BUT...you cannot over tighten the nuts holding the potentiometers...it will pull the shaft up and the wiper in the potentiometer will become \"crunchy\" or stiff...so don't do that. Even pulling the knobs off can do this if the knobs are on tightly. If you accidentally do pull up on the shaft too hard, it is easy enough just to push the shaft back down...so no worries. This LP has very smooth potentiometers...you do not have to pull up on the knobs...there are no other functions. If for some reason, you do goof them up, these quick connects are awesome...just drop in a long shaft pot...tighten it down...reconnect the quick connects...back in business...no soldering : ) She plays great...sounds great and comes with everything you see in the pictures...there is even a pic from the tech bench when she was \"born\"...hahaha. This LP will come with the original case as well. I will be shipping Fedex Ground insured within the continental United States. If anyone has any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
