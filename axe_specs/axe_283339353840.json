{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Plays and sounds very good, only selling because I have 8 American strats (yes I know I have a problem). Some scratches and dings, most of which are not on the face luckily. Notice in the pictures there\u2019s 2 major dings on the side. This guitar was modified before I got it, I bought it with a pink pick guard and different pickups, I believe the guy said he built it for his wife. The previous owner did give me the original pickups, electronics, and pick guard which I put back on. So basically the guitar is all original besides the back cover, which I\u2019m not exactly sure where it\u2019s from but it\u2019s sun faded and had a sticker on it. There\u2019s also a couple paint chips around the neck pocket, and some scratching on the bottom of the neck, I believe from the pick guard brushing up against it when they were being swapped out. There\u2019s a couple of spots on the neck where it\u2019s worn from being played, you can see them in the pictures. All of these things are pretty minor and don\u2019t really matter, atleast in my opinion, but I\u2019m trying to really pick this thing apart so you know exactly what to expect. Message with any more questions.
