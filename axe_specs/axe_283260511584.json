{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Very nice working Coral Sitar. Original hardshell case. Sounds good. Scratchy volume pot but functional. Has a few dings in the finish but overall very good shape for an instrument from 1968. Frets have lots of life left in them and the action is superb. This one is strung and ready to play. The Coral electric sitar was marketed as an easy and affordable way for guitar players to get a great new sound reminiscent of the difficult to master Indian sitar sound popularized by Ravi Shankar,\u00a0George Harrison, and others in\u00a0the \u201960s.\u00a0 Though rare, the\u00a0Coral Sitar and later reissues by other brands such as\u00a0Jerry Jones\u00a0have\u00a0been played in the studio and onstage by artists as varied as Buddy Guy, Yes, Rory Gallagher,\u00a0The Clash, and Pat Metheny. Its unique sound has\u00a0also figured prominently in\u00a0popular songs during each\u00a0decade; in the late 1970s, Eddie Van Halen used one for his solo on \u201cAin\u2019t Talkin\u2019 \u2019Bout Love\u201d from Van Halen\u2019s debut album. The Eurythmics\u2019 Dave Stewart played in the 1985 video for \u201cDon\u2019t Come Around Here No More\u201d by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. In 1991, Metallica used it for the intro to \u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d and in recent years, MGMT guitarist Andrew VanWyngarden used one on\u00a0Congratulations. Musicians seeking interesting sounds will likely always\u00a0find ways to spotlight the creative innovation of Vincent Bell. Nails the tones heard on countless records.
