{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Guild Starfire IV electric guitar black 1974 serial # 90720 pressed into back of headstock, barely legible. Semi-hollow body. Rosewood fingerboard. Original Guild tuners, pickups and electronics. Very little fret wear. ***It appears there was a crack in the headstock that was fixed- pre-1984*** Current owner has owned the guitar since 1984 and has had no issues with it. Had to relist this item- ebay had some sort of automatic fill in the original listing that wouldn't come off- I had to remove the original listing to revise it. The guitar is a black electric guitar!

We have sold several guitars and have had issues because a special document needs to be attached stating the type of wood that's used in the guitar.
