The xtSA delivers big time electric sounds via the Godin humbucker-single-humbucker pickup configuration and thanks to a special 5-way switch setup extra meaty humbucker tones co-exist with glassy split-coil sounds in the second and forth position. Turn down the electric output and raise the volume on the RMC transducer saddles and the xtSA becomes an incredibly authentic-sounding &lsquo;acoustic&rsquo; guitar. The acoustic voice of the xtSA is enhanced by an onboard preamp with a three-way graphic EQ. The two outputs are set up so that the electric and acoustic voices can be blended in the guitar using a single patch cord or at the amp/mixer using both outputs. The icing on the xtSA cake comes in the form of its synth tracking, which simply put, is the best in the business. As with all of Godin synth-ready instruments, a built-in 13-pin connector provides direct access to all Roland GR-Series synths as well as most other 13-pin devices. All of this sound power would be a lot less interesting if the guitar didn&rsquo;t feel great and great is exactly how the xtSA feels thanks to the same 25\u00bd&rdquo; scale, mahogany neck used on the Godin flagship LGX-SA guitar. The ebony fingerboard is shaped with Godin&rsquo;s ergocut technique and equipped with medium jumbo frets.
