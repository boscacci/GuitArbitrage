{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a real nice guitar. The neck flat and fast, but I have two strats and can't quite get used to this.It's super light, and I really like the way it rests on my body. The tone is great too!And the dragon eye quilt maple top is fabulous. 24 frets. You can really hit high notes on this one.This would be a super guitar to learn on, as the action is so low it's amazing. Intermediate players would excel on this as well I think. Neck is straight and intonation is good. Great rock tone.I set the trem for dive only, when it ships, the strings will be relaxed. You should just have to tune it and it'll be set.I bought this used myself so I don't know the year it was made, but think it's within the last couple years.The case looks real good too.Please ask any questions before bidding.", "ItemID": "254059141533", "EndTime": "2019-01-18T04:54:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-08T22:32:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-S-Series-S670QM-Dragon-Eye-Maple-W-Hard-Case-Excellent-COndition-/254059141533", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Hanover, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540591415338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/VrMAAOSwWz5cNR-F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/fIsAAOSw~wVcNR-m/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/NicAAOSwdaVcNR-5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/fMcAAOSw~wVcNR~O/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/vFUAAOSwK1dcNR~a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/nuAAAOSwWapcNSAl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/unYAAOSwdRFcNSA8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "17331", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sideshoppe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1495, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 22}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez S Series S670QM Dragon Eye Maple W/Hard Case.
