{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The Clapton Stratocaster was the first signature model that Fender ever offered and these James Burton Tele's were just a handful of years behind. After years of playing with Dale Hawkin's, Elvis, Ricky Nelson, The Everly Brothers and many more Burton came up with a set of requirements that would suite a diverse array of tones and that was visually.... unique! These have been offered in a variety of paisley patterns, this red paisley is rare as hen's teeth. It features \"Nashville\" pickup configuration with three lace sensor pickups, a 1 11/16ths nut width, 25.5 inch scale length, maple fingerboard, black hardware, 5-way selector switch and original hardshell case. The instrument is in played condition, it has some scratches and rash on the back, a small indent on the fingerboard and some finish flaws on the neck (the finish up next to the frets has subtle lifting on a few frets). The guitar is setup and plays great. The lace pickups are HIGH output and the guitar rips.
