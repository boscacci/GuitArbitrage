{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Add Me to Your Favorite Sellers Olivia's Vintage would like to present this 1975 Gibson Les Paul Custom in its original Cherry Sunburst finish. It has a great playing mahogany neck with good frets. It's all original and 100% complete along with its original hardshell case. On the bass side of the neck there is a very small hairline crack that was repaired and the finish around that area oversprayed. The crack is so minor it's difficult to see, but runs down from the nut just past the first fret. The back of the body also has a long line of surface cracking in the wood. It is more of a cosmetic issue and does not affect the structural integrity of the guitar as this cracking occurred as the wood in the body became more dry after the guitar was built. It is also stamped as a factory 2nd and it is possible that this cracking was the reason. Aside from those issues it looks great with nicks + dings, some minor cracking in the binding, and other minor cosmetic wear. All electronics work and sound great as it provides an authentic '70's Les Paul tone. All Illinois residents please add 8.75% sales tax. We are happy to ship internationally, and have CITES certificates available for rosewood exports.", "ItemID": "153324737894", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T04:04:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T14:47:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1975-Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom-Cherry-Sunburst-MAHOGANY-NECK-WAFFLE-BACK-TUNERS-/153324737894", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Carbondale, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533247378948080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/5PoAAOSw0d1cHUHS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/JHgAAOSwUP5cHUHU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/u4EAAOSwEvZcHUHW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/9VIAAOSwEONcHUHZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/h4UAAOSwUMBcHUHb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/KKoAAOSw4bhcHUHd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/ndYAAOSwUWtcHUHf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/~XQAAOSwCXxcHUHi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/gtYAAOSwtutcHUHl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/ozgAAOSwF5VcHUHn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/zHcAAOSwlfNcHUHr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/dK0AAOSwnfRcIQgP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "62901", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "oliviasvintage", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6821, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2790.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2790.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 17}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1975 Gibson Les Paul Custom Cherry Sunburst MAHOGANY NECK + WAFFLE BACK TUNERS!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 147, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "118985", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118985", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=414671", "StoreName": "Olivia&#39;s Vintage"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
