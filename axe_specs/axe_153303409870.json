{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This ESP is an ultra-rare full body thickness Custom Order Eclipse. This guitar plays perfectly, sounds amazing, and is in great condition. It was hand-made in the legendary ESP Custom Shop to exact, one-of-a-kind specifications (see the pictured build sheet). As you would expect, this guitar is exceptionally resonant and very loud unplugged. It produces a very full, thick tone that is also very articulate with an amazingly tight low end. I've owned many ESP Eclipses from Standard Series to very rare Custom Shop axes. This Eclipse produces the fullest, most articulate, and balanced tone of any I've ever played.\ufeff \ufeff The condition and build quality of this guitar is simply incredible. I have conservatively given this a \"Very Good\" grade, but the few imperfections it has are very minor and most sellers would rate it higher. There is a tiny nick on the bottom of the body near the strap button and one small patch of playwear on the back---a bit of shallow surface swirling from body contact (see last 2 pics). Beyond these minor blemishes, there are a few very fine pick-like scratches, some minor wear on the bridge saddles, and maybe a couple polishing swirls. Each of these are barely visible ---and only at certain angles. But, that's it. The neck is in fantastic shape and there is little to no fret wear. Overall, this killer axe is exceptionally clean for being 10 years old. You won't find one that plays and sounds this good in this condition. The COA, build sheet, and a form-fit ESP case will be included with purchase. The case has one minor mark that does not break the tolex cover (an indentation from being stored up against another case), but it works perfectly and is in practically new condition. Please check my seller feedback and buy with confidence. You won't be disappointed!!!
