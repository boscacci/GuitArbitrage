{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello! Up for sale is a very lightly used premium Ibanez RG 1070 pbz in cerulean blue. The guitar is in excellent condition. I received the guitar as a gift about a year ago. It is an excellent guitar with dimarzio pickups and awesome tonewoods. I believe the body is basswood with a burl top as seen in the photos. The neck is wenge with some other tonewoods. It is a very sturdy and fast playing instrument. It can play anything from fusion jazz all the way to heavy metal with ease. The pickups are pretty well balanced for versatility. With the single coil in the middle you can even achieve passable strat sounds. The guitar comes stock. No modifications have been made to this instrument. The guitar is sold as-is. It has been housed in its case its entire life. I played the guitar for maybe 10 hours total. It is in near pristine condition. No scratches, scuffs, or dings that I could see. I am selling to the lower 48 states. I have uploaded more photographs to better provide an accurate description of the guitar. The guitar will come with its original case. Please fell free to each out to me if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you and happy bidding!", "ItemID": "113490210680", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T04:07:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-26T04:07:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-RG1070PBZ-Premium-Series-Electric-Guitar-w-Case-Cerulean-Blue-Burst-/113490210680", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Los Angeles, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134902106808080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8LkAAOSwSn1cJbxD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bXsAAOSwNUlcIvwN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oHMAAOSwdxVcIvwd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NV8AAOSwvERcJbxN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6iMAAOSwydZcJbxQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1xMAAOSwkvtcJbxU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7nkAAOSwUVFcJbxg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90059", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "prepe2013", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 55, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***f", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 21}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez RG1070PBZ Premium Series Electric Guitar w/ Case - Cerulean Blue Burst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RG1070PBZ"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Color", "Value": ["Cerulean Blue Burst"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ibanez RG"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 412, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 720.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
