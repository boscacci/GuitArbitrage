{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale here is a 2001 Jackson DR3 Electric Guitar. This guitar is made in Japan and plays great. The color is translucent green with a black back. This guitar originally had duncan designed direct mount to body pickups. I changed the pickups to actual seymour duncan pickups (a jb in the bridge and a 59 in the neck). I added pickup mounting rings to be able to change pickups since the original duncan designed screw holes are much larger. There is nothing wrong with this guitar at all, I just don't play it. I have too many guitars and don't need this. It's a very nice guitar and I'd hate to see it just sit. It has some dings here and from regular wear but everything on this guitar works perfectly. I am including a padded gig bag, trem bar, as well as both floyd rose allen keys and the truss rod wrench that did not originally come with this guitar. Shipping is $50. I only accept regular paypal payments. NO E-CHECKS!!!!. This is a U.S. only auction. No international bids. I am not shipping this internationally. Buyers bid with confidence. I have 100% POSITIVE FEEDBACK and have been selling on ebay for well over a decade. If you have any questions please ask them before placing any bids. Thank you.", "ItemID": "113363919687", "EndTime": "2018-11-17T22:53:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-10T22:53:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2001-Jackson-DR3-Guitar-gig-bag-/113363919687", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Levittown, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1133639196878080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjYzWDE1ODc=/z/CDYAAOSwt~1b513C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/C~IAAOSw7rlb512Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwNFgxMTg2/z/-NAAAOSw1tJb513Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hCcAAOSwlxxb512c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-aAAAOSwRrlb512d/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kR8AAOSwqlpb512f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VHUAAOSwZ3pb512h/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hDAAAOSwlxxb512i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/--UAAOSwE9Bb512k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I2QAAOSwNWtb512m/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FCoAAOSwpFtb512o/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/O7kAAOSwr~tb512q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "19056", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "napalm11", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 355, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 8907}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2001 Jackson DR3 Guitar with gig bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Translucent Green"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["DR3"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Has added pickup rings and seymour duncan jb and 59 pickups which were not originally included."]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 98, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 232.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar is used and has some dings for it's age but is in great shape.
