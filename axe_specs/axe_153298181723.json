SELLER'S NOTES/CUSTOMARY FINE PRINT: --------------------------------------------------------------- ITEM HISTORY: We do not know the history of most of these items, so please do not ask. They have all been tested in at least a basic capacity when we acquired them and are known to be in working condition. YOUR SATISFACTION MATTERS TO US! While we work with many items, we cannot do prolonged testing on absolutely every item that comes through, nor can we test every single feature of an item. If you have a problem with an item after receiving it, please let us know so that we may work with you to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase. NO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING OUTSIDE OF THE EBAY GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. Please do not place a bid if your country is excluded from this program. This is firm. No exceptions. REMEMBER: This is an auction. All bids are final and will not be cancelled or altered. Please make absolutely sure you want it before you bid on it. Once you bid, you are committed. If you win it and don't want it, you are more than welcome to re-sell it when it arrives. ALSO: Please be responsible. Understand what you are buying and the terms under which it is being sold. If the item description says that something is missing or not included, please do not attempt to return it because that item is not included. And if it is an item that we offer a 14-day return policy on, please remember that you are responsible for the cost of return shipping, and also the restocking fee. PAYMENTS: Payments must be made within two days of the auction closing or an unpaid item case will automatically be opened by ebay. If you require a longer time to pay, please let us know so we can disable the automatic unpaid item assistant. FEEDBACK: While we make every attempt to leave feedback on our transactions (and ask that you please do, also) there may be times when we forget. Please feel free to send us a reminder. We're perfectly okay with that.", "ItemID": "153298181723", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T16:57:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T17:13:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dean-Custom-Zone-Electric-Guitar-/153298181723", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Houma, Louisiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532981817238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5N1gxNjAw/z/5MAAAOSwgbdcDp34/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMTk2/z/ydkAAOSw~rhcDp4w/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMTk2/z/UwQAAOSwRfxcDp5W/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "70363", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "capital-02", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 326, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.4}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 162.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 162.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Dean Custom Zone Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Dean"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 40, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 164.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "GREAT CONDITION TESTED, IN GOOD WORKING ORDER", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
