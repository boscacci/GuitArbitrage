{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "At Canton Music we don't send out an instrument that's been sitting in a warehouse for months, we send you the EXACT instrument that you see pictured. Before shipping out any instrument, we make sure it gets the approval of our in house tech, Dr. Bones. In addition to Dr. Bones' 12-Point inspection, he'll often write his own review of the instrument and we'll feature it in the description. Jackson JS Series Dinky\u2122 Arch Top JS32 DKA-M Electric Guitar Bright Blue An arched top body, dual humbuckers, Floyd Rose bridge and a lot of Jackson DNA. Swift, deadly and affordable, Jackson\u00ae JS Series guitars take an epic leap forward, making it easier than ever to get classic Jackson tone, looks and playability without breaking the bank. The JS Series Dinky\u2122 Arch Top JS32 DKA has a poplar or nato (Natural Oil only) body with arched top, bolt-on maple speed neck with graphite reinforcement and a 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets and pearloid sharkfin inlays. A pair of Jackson high-output humbucking pickups with ceramic magnets cranks out clear tone with plenty of girth, and can be shaped with a three-way blade switch and single volume and tone controls. Available in several striking finishes, the JS32 DKA also features white neck binding and all-black hardware including a Jackson-branded Floyd Rose\u00ae double-locking tremolo bridge, standard strap buttons and die-cast tuners.
