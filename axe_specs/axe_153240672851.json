{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is my 1982 USA Made Fender Bullet in excellent condition. This is literally a \"Closet Classic\" and has not been played in 30+ years. It has been stored in it's original case which is in excellent condition and is included in this auction. It has a beautiful and straight neck with the vintage fender shine and a beautifully aged cream colored body AND CLEAN HARDWARE. This guitar is untouched since new and is 100% original and that I am sure of. It has one pretty good hack on the back (don't blame the kid too much...it was done over 30 years ago), and two very small surface bumps on the back of the neck that were too small to capture in the pictures. They are not at all through the finish and are not noticeable to the touch as when playing...Just want to let you know so no disappointments. The is the typical Fender finish crack in the neck pocket but it is quite minimal. I will put new strings on if you let me know what gauge you like and will include the Fender strap with as well. Thanks for looking and happy bidding!
