{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Guild Newark St. Collection Bluesbird in Gloss Black A Chambered Flamed Maple Solid Body Electric Guitar With USA Seymour Duncan Pickups Includes a Guild Deluxe Gigbag Vintage jazz guitar tone and style from the brand that helped define it! The Bluesbird reflects Guild\u2019s return to yet another historic solid body model. Originally released in 1970 as the solid body counterpart to the M-75 Aristocrat, the Bluesbird was subject to a few design changes over the decades. Today\u2019s reissue features a carved maple top and maintains many of the aesthetic traits of the M-75 Bluesbird of the late 60s. Its lightweight chambered mahogany body allows for improved resonance and unparalleled comfort, making this guitar one of the lightest in its class. The Bluesbird features a 24 3/4\u201d scale, and fast-playing vintage C shaped neck. While many of the Bluesbird\u2019s specifications remain faithful to the original model, today\u2019s updated version comes equipped with USA-made Seymour Duncan pickups, as well as a TonePros locking tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece to offer the most versatile version of this guitar to date.
