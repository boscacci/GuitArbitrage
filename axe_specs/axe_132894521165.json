{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This listing on behalf of South Florida Gun And Pawn Peavey Horizon Electric Guitar With Original Hard Case IN VERY GOOD USED CONDITION This is a rather well taken care of Vintage Peavey electric guitar. It's not perfect by any means but it's not bad at all either. The foam part of it's original genuine Peavey hard case is falling apart and one of it's latches don't seem to want to snap closed. Also the strings clearly need to be changed and there's some green crud on the frets. I'm certain all cosmetic issues will clean up just fine but I will leave that up to you. I have connected it to an amp and tested it and it sounds great. All the knobs work and the switch functions in every position as well. There can't be too many of these still around in this condition. Zoom in on the pictures for more detail.
