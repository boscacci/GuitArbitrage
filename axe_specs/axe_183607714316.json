{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Signature Les Paul is amazing! I bought it with the upgrades and have loved playing it exclusively in my home studio environment. I\u2019ve treasured it and would love to keep it, but an arm injury has impacted my ability to continue playing. With the exception of the tuner and pickup upgrades, the Gibson website completely describes the guitar: http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-USA/Buckethead-Signature-Les-Paul.aspx. This guitar was made in the USA in 2010, Serial Number 104000605 Although it\u2019s in great condition, there are a few imperfections that I\u2019ve tried to indicate in the images with red annotations (no, those red marks are NOT on the guitar): a small scratch on the backside of the head near the top just above the serial number, a pinhole in the finish on the side of the body (that faces up towards to the player just around the edge from the kill switch), a small finish crack on the bottom side near where the neck attaches to the body, and six exposed screw holes on the backside of the head where the original tuners were mounted. The guitar needs new strings. The Alpine White finish has yellowed slightly, but uniformly, with age; a common occurrence with this model. The original Gibson hard case is in great condition. Mine is a non-smoking house, so the guitar and case are smoke-free. If you\u2019re local to the Bay Area of San Francisco (near Napa) you are welcome to arrange a pick-up! Alternatively, I\u2019ll pack it and ship it ground to you in the continental USA free of added charge, insured for the amount you purchased it for. If you wish for it to be shipped outside of the continental USA or via a faster method, please reach out to me to make arrangements - I\u2019ll split the difference with you. PayPal only, please, for payment. Please send me your questions but give me 24 hours to respond. Thank you for your interest!On Dec-29-18 at 16:21:12 PST, seller added the following information: I\u2019ve received several inquiries about the original tuners and pickups. Regretfully, I do not have them. However, in the case is the original sales receipt and it has the name and contact information of the first owner. Perhaps the successful bidder could reach out to him to inquire.", "ItemID": "183607714316", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T02:58:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-28T02:58:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Buckethead-Les-Paul-Signature-Upgrades-Bareknuckle-pickups-Grover-Tuners-/183607714316", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Napa, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836077143168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kWwAAOSwwTFcJXAs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NjM=/z/9eIAAOSwe9VcJXAe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1N1gxNjAw/z/xUMAAOSwmXpcJXAl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ewoAAOSwfsdcJXAv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM5OVgxNjAw/z/wZoAAOSwMhVcJYtm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5OTA=/z/CVoAAOSwjrFcJXAu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkzWDE2MDA=/z/9S8AAOSwKphcJXA7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KfIAAOSwVYhcJXA-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/gIYAAOSwW9NcJY9~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDA1/z/qOMAAOSwsPNcJY-R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/FLEAAOSwM6FcJY-q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94559", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gregory36", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 136, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2094}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Buckethead Les Paul Signature Upgrades Bareknuckle pickups Grover Tuners", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Signature Buckethead Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["Comes with original paperwork, simple strap and original Gibson hard case"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Bareknuckle pickups and Grover tuners"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Alpine White"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Kill switch"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 619, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 3650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
