{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar is beautiful. The finish puts translucent white on a swamp ash body, creating the guitar's \"white blonde\" color. This guitar has been played sparingly since being purchased new several years ago and is in very nice overall shape. There is some wear from playing on the pickguard and you will probably find some minor imperfections in a couple of places on the body. In terms of the things that matter that you can actually see like chips, dings and scratches in the paint - I really don't see any. This is about as nice a pre-owned cabronita as you will find - please see pictures. As background, these guitars are different from traditional telecasters and are becoming much harder to find. They are distinct in that they use 2 Fidelitron pickups (humbuckers based on a Gretsch design). They also use a single volume control and a three-way switch. No tone control was included in the design to avoid limiting the natural high tones the guitar produces. The pickguard is also smaller than usual, which is influenced by the early Fender prototypes. The guitar comes with a gig bag and includes the store tags and allen key that came with it. The guitar and gig bag are being sold as-is. You are buying from a long-time ebayer with 100% feedback, so have confidence in what you are buying and that it will be shipped carefully. Pay pal only. Continental United States only. Please message me with any questions. Thank you for your interest!", "ItemID": "323615717246", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T18:06:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-22T18:06:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-TELECASTER-CABRONITA-THINLINE-WHITE-BLONDE-HTF-/323615717246", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Lutz, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236157172468080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gYoAAOSwFvBbujia/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oMgAAOSw-pNbujii/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/28kAAOSw0kRbujio/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-6YAAOSw8sBbujiw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HQYAAOSw6-Nbujho/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YBgAAOSwFzZbuji5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/h~4AAOSwj6lbujhr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NhsAAOSwjXBbujjI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lLgAAOSwyEdbujjQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fcEAAOSw5atbujjX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PqoAAOSwj81bujhg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XuYAAOSwFCpbujjh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33558", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sebibash", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 553, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 735.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 735.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 489}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER TELECASTER CABRONITA THINLINE WHITE BLONDE - HTF!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Cabronita Thinline"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White Blonde"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}]}, "HitCount": 512, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 745.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar has light wear but has been well cared for and is in very nice overall condition - please see description and pictures for details", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
