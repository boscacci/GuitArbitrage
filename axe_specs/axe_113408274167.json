{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Squire is about as new as you're going to get without buying new. Check the pics for overall appearance. I can't seem to find any scratches or dings on it anywhere. Looks like a new one or at worst a very nice floor sample. I've never played it since owning it other than to tune it. The pots, switches and such all appear to work just fine. These Classic Vibe Squires have been getting great reviews online. You'll find plenty of people saying these things can go head-to-head with guitars costing twice as much. Quality on this thing is far, far superior to the cheap Affinity and Bullet models. Truly a dynamite little Strat for the money. Of course it would lend itself to the common upgrades if you'd like to go that route, but about the only thing I'd be tempted to do to it for now is maybe a roller string tree and a graphite or bone nut. Being a used guitar it may require some tweaks and a possible setup to suit your playing style. Bidders should be aware of this. Ships to lower 48 USA only. Please note: The guitar case and guitar stand are NOT included in this sale. Guitar only is what you're bidding on. However, I will wrap the unit extremely carefully and package it accordingly to prevent damage in shipping. All sales final, so do your research and consider what you're buying before you bid. I won't accept returns because of buyers' remorse. Thanks and good luck-", "ItemID": "113408274167", "EndTime": "2018-11-30T06:31:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-28T22:07:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squire-Stratocaster-Classic-Vibe-Model-Very-Clean-Condition-/113408274167", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Monmouth, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134082741678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjIz/z/f5QAAOSwZHVbtoid/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/5n8AAOSwUIxbtois/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/5EAAAOSwfbhbtoiw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2N1gxNjAw/z/zooAAOSwX8dbtoiw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyMFgxNTk5/z/xo4AAOSwilVbtoiv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1NFgxNjAw/z/bB4AAOSwS~Fbtoiv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODE=/z/XycAAOSwYNlbtoiu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjA2/z/JlkAAOSwxOVbtoiu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/aKYAAOSwaY9btoiw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTMyWDE2MDA=/z/tI8AAOSwYsBbtoix/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDE4/z/q4EAAOSwlelb2dHm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTQzWDE2MDA=/z/yQMAAOSwCVtb2dHm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "61462", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "buzzkill4u2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 629, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 235.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 235.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 36}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squire Stratocaster Classic Vibe Model - Very Clean Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Classic Vibe"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Classical"]}]}, "HitCount": 83, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 237.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
