{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Welcome to our NO RESERVE auction! You are bidding on a NICE 1997 Gibson Custom Shop Les Paul Bantam Elite \"F\" Holes model guitar in Candy Apple Red. I have received via email the spec sheet from Gibson's Custom Shop confirming the model/year/color of this guitar (see last pic) Condition:The great news is this guitar is a player and not a case queen. You can play this one at home or on the road without worrying about a scratch or two. The back of the guitar has plenty of playing/buckle marks and swirls in the finish from regular play (black shows all the imperfections). The top of the guitar is in good shape with a few scratches from playing. The candy apple red finish hides some of the scratches until light hits it. The frets have virtually no wear at all. The truss rod turns freely and the electronics work as they should. The guitar weighs 8lbs on my postal scale. The guitar/case does come from a smoking household so if you have a super sensitive sniffer this might not be the guitar for you. Original Gibson case is in good shape; a little marked up on the outside. To recap, the guitar is a player but still in remarkable shape. The finish is bright and shows well. This is a rare, fantastic guitar that can be played and enjoyed. Please email me with any questions or requests for more pictures. There is no \"buy it now\" price. FREE Shipping will either be USPS Priority Mail or FedEx ground (lower 48 states and no PO BOXES please) depending on final destination and weight of package. Payment is due within 3 days of auction end.", "ItemID": "163502854756", "EndTime": "2019-01-29T17:13:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T17:13:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Gibson-Custom-Shop-Les-Paul-Custom-Bantam-Elite-OHSC-Candy-Apple-FREE-SHIP-/163502854756", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Martinsburg, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635028547568080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tzsAAOSwd7FcSe-B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/o6cAAOSwiKdcSe-C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gOIAAOSwpl5cSe-E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0noAAOSw7MNcSe-H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lBAAAOSwbjNcSe-I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AtwAAOSwkAxcSe-K/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-O4AAOSwg1JcSe-P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/H2gAAOSw7aNcSe-P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pvAAAOSw8NNcSe-R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "25404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "paradisepawnwvmartinsburg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2851, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 48, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2175.85, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2175.85, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Gibson Custom Shop Les Paul Custom Bantam Elite OHSC Candy Apple FREE SHIP!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson Custom Shop"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Bantam Elite \"F\" Holes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Candy Apple Red"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Elite"]}]}, "HitCount": 543, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2200.85, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "AF", "AM", "AZ", "BD", "BT", "CN", "GE", "IN", "JP", "KZ", "KR", "KG", "MV", "MN", "NP", "PK", "LK", "TJ", "TM", "UZ", "AL", "AD", "AT", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "GI", "GR", "GG", "HU", "IS", "IE", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LI", "LT", "LU", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "NL", "NO", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SJ", "SE", "CH", "UA", "GB", "VA"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
