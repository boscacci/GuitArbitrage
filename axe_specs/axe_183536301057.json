{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Alvarez \"Tele\" copy with distinctive three-pickup Nashville Tele pickup arrangement. I haven't been able to find out much about it and supposedly the serial numbers do not help in that regard. It does say on the back of the headstock that it was made in Korea. Age (?): circa late 80'-90's If anybody out there can help me to pinpoint identifying information please pass it along, I would appreciate it very much. It comes with the hardshell case and the guitar & case together weigh in at about 18 pounds. It has been professionally set-up and played very little since then . . . just not my sound . . . but just about the best looking guitar I own. Please ask any questions you may have before bidding/buying as thios guitar is sold as is with no return.", "ItemID": "183536301057", "EndTime": "2018-11-21T23:01:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T23:01:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Alvarez-Tele-Style-Guitar-/183536301057", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Savannah, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835363010578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/1NsAAOSwtQNb7KLy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/UswAAOSwz05b7KL1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/1c8AAOSwVRxb7KL5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYxWDE2MDA=/z/3TQAAOSworNb7KL9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMxOVgxMTE1/z/Y0QAAOSwNTNb7KMA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DOoAAOSwvhxb7KME/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY3WDE2MDA=/z/ZggAAOSwnCdb7KMG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "31406", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "oldfatdog0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 93, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 638}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Alvarez \"Tele\" Style Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Alvarez"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 305, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 205.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
