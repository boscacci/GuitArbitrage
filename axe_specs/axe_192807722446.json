{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a low \"A\" serial number 1981 Gibson Heritage Flying V Korina w/ original hardshell case. These guitars were produced from 1981 through 1984. Some very early limited prototypes were made of mahogany with production models made from two, or three piece white korina wood bodies. The vast majority of them have a black pickguard. But the first year \"1981\" mostly came with white pickguards and black, red interior hardshell cases. This one is a three piece korina body in great shape, with the guitar's body wood and finish having no dents or bumps typically seen on the bottom of the wings. The top, back, and neck are also in excellent condition. Zero bucklerash. The only bump is on the headstock by the top tuners (pic attached). On most three piece body examples that I have seen, the three pieces are distinguishable, sometimes having different shades, as Gibson didn't do a very good job of matching the grain. This one is different however, having some very nice black korina streaks throughout the white limba (korina) wood making it look like a one piece body. The only way I was able to tell it was a three piece was from the tell-tale lines on the sides of the wings. These came with Tim Shaw PAF humbuckers, with the neck pickup on this one measuring 6.92 k ohms, and bridge measuring 7.24 k ohms. Measurement was taken using a professional multimeter with a patch cord connected to the guitars output jack (pics attached). The guitar weighs a very low 6.4 lbs. Now, the takeaways are that the truss rod cover was replaced, as a small portion of the white layer by the top of the bell chipped off and was nowhere to be found. The original is included in the case. The guitar was professionally re-fretted a few years ago with jumbo frets, and the nut was also replaced to adjust the action due to taller frets. The neck is straight as an arrow, plays like butter and the guitar sounds absolutely amazing. Plenty of detailed pictures of the fingerboard and frets are provided. This was an excellent re-fret. The exterior of the guitar's case is not great, but the interior is in excellent condition. It is impossible to cover all angles of a flying V with just the 12 pictures that Ebay allows so I've attached plenty below to show every angle of every side of this guitar. I understand that a re-fret can lower the value of a guitar due to the fact that it is no longer completely original, and as stated before, the exterior of the case is not great, so this guitar is priced accordingly. Most at this price have permanent undesirable mods such as extra holes in the body or pickguard from added switches, etc. Not here. This is a very nice Heritage Korina Flying V. For more information and lots of history on these guitars please visit the Flying V Heritage website http://www.flying-v.ch/heritage/heritage.htm Shipping is to the contiguous US only. Sorry, no Int'l shipping. Processing of shipment may take up to three business days, as I travel for a living, but am usually back within three days of departure.
