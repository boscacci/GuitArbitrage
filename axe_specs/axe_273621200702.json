{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "CALL OR TEXT G-BRAT\u2019S GUITARS ANYTIME; (972)816-7736 You're looking at a 2009 Gibson Les Paul Supreme with a Heritage Cherry Sunburst finish, on a gorgeous maple flamed top and back, with and gold hardware. If that\u2019s not enough, this is also equipped with a real EBONY fretboard, which you will not see on the newer ones. The action is fast and low... 490R & 498T pups really crank! Notice that there are no back plates? That's because the electronics were configured through the extra large jack plate. The back is carved and flamed, just as the top. Just a killer guitar all the way! She's 100% original and ready to rock!Here is the lowdown on all the features:Model: Les Paul SupremeFinish: Heritage cherry sunburst, glossTop: Carved AAAA mapleBack: Carved AAAA maple, with no back plates, chambered bodyFretboard: EbonyFret Inlays: Split parallelagram, mother-of-pearlScale Length: 24-3/4\"Neck: Mahogany, set neckNeck Profile: 50's roundedHardware: GoldTuners: Grover gold metal tulipHeadstock Inlay: \"Supreme\", with pearl, abalone globeBridge: Nashville tune-o-matic, with stop tailPickups: Gibson 490R & 498T humbuckersControls: 2 volume, 2 tone and 3-way pickup selectorKnobs: Gold speed knobsWeight: 8.5 lbs.Serial # 019090401 She was born in 2009 and has been played, but well cared for\u2026 until UPS decided to crack the headstock. Yes, this arrived in my shop with a cracked headstock, which we then took to the world famous Charlie\u2019s Guitar Shop in Dallas, who proceeded to do an excellent job of repairing this. The guitar is now in great and stable playing condition\u2026 even stronger than before! Aside from the above mentioned important disclosure, the hardware has a fair amount of gold wear, particularly on the tail-piece, and there is some hazing below the treble strings. Regardless, as you can see in the pics, the guitar still looks amazing despite these flaws. Also included is the original Gibson hard shell case with the white interior and satin shroud, along with completed set of strap locks and the Gibson booklet, just as shown in the last picture!
