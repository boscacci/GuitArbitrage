{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 1979/1980 Fender Stratocaster. Kind of a mongrel guitar I've had for a long time. Assembled from various parts from the same era. It's a cool guitar and plays and sounds wonderful. Great stratocaster sound. Grey bottom pickups and the oh-so-cool blonde finish with black pickguard and pickup covers. Neck is a 1979 stratocaster maple neck. Serial S941253. The back of the neck is refinished. Fretboard finish is original. Frets are original and have plenty of life left in them. Neck is straight with just the right amount of relief. Truss rod works. Original nut. Original finish on the headstock where the logo is. The rest of the headstock is sanded smooth. Original tuning pegs. The guitar never had any other pegs on it. The butt of the neck is refinished, so there's no date stamp. The neck has a great chunky feel to it. It has an original set of F tuners on it. The body is a late 1970's body. It has a center seam two-piece body. Ash wood. At some point, it the center seam came unglued. The two halves were re-glued, but first reinforced with a tongue-in-groove center piece of wood, done professionally. Also, there was a humbucker route that was fillled at the bridge pickup cavity with a correct piece of ash wood. It was refinished in vintage blonde, with a spray can, but it's an OK finish. There is a clear coat of finish on top of it. I don't know what the original finish was. The pickups are 1980 grey bottoms. The neck and middle are stamped 192080, and the bridge is stamped something like 191080. The pots are original CTS pots from 1980, but the shafts have been replaced because the tops had been broken off. The 5-way switch is an original CTS switch. The black plastic knobs are correct 3-spoke reissue, and the pickguard is an older WD replacement that looks exactly right. the bridge is a correct 1970's one-piece bridge, with the part number 010347 molded into the metal at the base. The saddles are vintage 1970's saddles with the part number 027037 on the bottom. The saddle screws are different, but they work. The bridge mounting screws are new. The trem arm hole is messed up and appears to have a thread tap broken off inside (not me! I didn't do it!). The pickguard screws are older. The neckplate might be original, or maybe a correct reissue. The neck screws are original. The trem cover plate on the back is an older, non-original one I had that I added. The strap buttons look like an original pair. A cool guitar, but as you can see, it was assembled from some different vintage parts. It is an affordable vintage 1970's stratocaster that is a pleasure to play. It plays great and has a great Fender strat tone. The guitar weighs 8 pounds, 4 ounces, so it's not super heavy, but not light either. Comes with a used gig bag. Buyer pays $25 shipping. International shipping will be about $70-100. -Fred.", "ItemID": "183543151496", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T03:12:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T03:12:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1979-1980-Fender-Stratocaster-Guitar-old-parts-grey-btm-pickups-refin-NR-/183543151496", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "East Greenwich, Rhode Island", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835431514968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/8V4AAOSwDEBb8hE8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/O58AAOSwHjtb8hFA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/PtYAAOSw5cZb8hFH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/eJcAAOSwF8Fb8hFO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/8B0AAOSwi7Vb8hFV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/tpEAAOSw851b8hFc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/5QUAAOSwtjhb8hFj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/bUcAAOSwdhdb8hFr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/OcAAAOSww7tb8hFy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/okEAAOSwEcxb8hF6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/gLIAAOSw8iZb8hGC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/jeAAAOSwBJVb8hGI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "02818", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kidkwik", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4782, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 23, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 600}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1979/1980 Fender Stratocaster Guitar old parts grey btm pickups refin NR", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1979"]}]}, "HitCount": 627, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "118985", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118985", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=4149503", "StoreName": "the humble supergenius"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
