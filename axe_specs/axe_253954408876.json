{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I have owned this Lucille since the mid 90's never gigged, really haven't played it that much. Sat in the case most of the time I've owned it. Just plugged it in and everything is fully functional. There are no cracks, breaks, buckle rash, no repairs. The only thing I had changed out was the pick up covers. The other ones were faded but I will include the originals in the case. The frets have plenty of life left. It weighs 10 lbs. It is missing one of the strap buttons - check pictures. The case is in great condition. I can't remember the combination to the lock which you will see pictured. There are some pic scratching on the pic guard. But overall this guitar is in great condition and sounds great. I am pricing this lower than other eBay listings so if you want a Lucille at a great price - here is your chance. Thanks for looking. I only ship to the lower 48 and no International.", "ItemID": "253954408876", "EndTime": "2018-11-04T19:47:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-28T19:47:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-B-B-King-Lucille-/253954408876", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bristol, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2539544088768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/59EAAOSwwb1bpuFV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/EyMAAOSwDPRbpuFY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/AL4AAOSwD89bpuFT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/1V0AAOSwBBpbpuFV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/izcAAOSwy-5bpuFN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/mk0AAOSwS~FbpuFQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/mjkAAOSw8D9bpuFW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/OuUAAOSwgYdbpuFY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/Zj4AAOSwsD1bpuFI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/2-sAAOSw0ZZbpunJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/ZFUAAOSwO-xbpunL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/BOQAAOSwNwdbpunK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "46507", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "peefe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 246, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2075.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2075.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 237}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson B.B. \u00a0King Lucille", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 264, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["APO/FPO", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
