{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this vintage Fender Stratocaster electric guitar in a beautiful white finish that has aged to an awesome looking cream color over the years. It was built in the USA in 1978-1979. It was recently acquired from the original owner and comes with the original hardshell case and case candy (hang tag, warranty card, and manual). It also comes with the original bridge cover and tremolo arm. The guitar looks, sounds, and plays great! This is a nice example of a late 70's Fender Strat with a 3-bolt neck with a micro-tilt adjustment. Everything appears to be original with the exception of an updated black pickguard and black back plate tremolo cover and back plate screws. There are some scratches, dings, and small areas of worn paint, which is to be expected on an instrument of this age. The frets are in good shape with plenty of life left in them and the clear coat finish has been removed from the fretboard. It was just gone over and restrung with 9 gauge strings by a local tech and is ready to be played. Please feel free to ask any questions or make an offer!", "ItemID": "263961859148", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T20:33:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-28T00:45:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1978-1979-Fender-American-Stratocaster-Aged-White-Cream-Maple-Neck-USA-/263961859148", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cathedral City, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2639618591488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SysAAOSwzc1brXlB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wu8AAOSwC0dbrXlD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I2MAAOSwAm9brXlD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PHYAAOSwy-5brXlB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bXsAAOSwvl9brXlE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jHgAAOSwl4lbrXlD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X4sAAOSw7W1brXlC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4jQAAOSwXpFbrXlC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vSIAAOSwn6RbrXlF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nT0AAOSwpTJbrXlE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/h24AAOSwPCZbrXlD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7Y4AAOSw5jhbrXlE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mydeadblues", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 32}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1978-1979 Fender American Stratocaster Aged White Cream Maple Neck USA\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1978-1979"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 1431, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
