The all-new G6131T Players Edition Jet FT with Bigsby is the culmination of over half a century of tonal and performance magic.Chambered Mahogany Bodies Fat, Full and Acoustically RichLike its forebears, the Jet FT begins with a select mahogany body with maple top that produces the signature strong, punchy response that has made the Jet famous. For the Players Edition Jet FT, we chose a 1.85\" depth along with modern chambering to deliver a tighter, more controlled attack that still retains incredible articulation.High Sensitive Filter'Tron Pickups Classic Power and ClarityA pair of High Sensitive Filter'Tron pickups complements the Jet FT's chambered body to produce a wide, balanced and transparent tone that is equally adept at cutting through the mix or laying solid sonic foundation.Players Edition Comfort, Control PerformanceResponding to players' need for increased comfort, the Jet FT features a lowered neck set that greatly improves fret-hand mobility while also giving the picking hand a closer approach, increasing comfort and accuracy. Our new full-access rolled cutaway and tapered heel allows the free access to upper frets without awkward pivoting or palm obstruction. This sleek design remains hidden, preserving a vintage aesthetic a critical feature that is meant to be felt, not seen.The Jet FT comes equipped with additional Players Edition features that give you total control of your tone and performance.
