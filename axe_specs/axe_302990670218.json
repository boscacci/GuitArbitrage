Buy with confidence, see my feedback. Good Listening, SonnY :) See specs below: The Les Paul Studio launched in 1983 as an affordable no-frills take on the classic Les Paul design. Like other Les Pauls, the Studio uses two humbuckers and a combination of a carved Maple top on a Mahogany body (though some early models use alder). Unlike other Les Pauls, the Studio lacks any sort of binding on the fingerboard or body. Starting in 2005, Gibson produced a version of the Les Paul Studio with a faded satin finish. Faded Cherry is the classic vintage look of the earlier Gibson electric guitars Years of Production: 1983 - present Wood Composition: Mahogany body, carved Maple top, Rosewood fingerboard Design Elements: Two humbucker pickups, four control knobs, block inlays Finish Specification: Worn Brown is one of the faded finishes of the Les Paul Studio which are less expensive than normal Studios. Notable Les Paul Players: Slash, Jimmy Page, Alex Lifeson", "ItemID": "302990670218", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T04:02:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T04:02:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Faded-Cherry-Deluxe-Case-Rarely-Played-Mint-Ex-/302990670218", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fort Walton Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029906702188080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yQAAAOSwxFVcBFgh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rwoAAOSwCXFcBFgq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hwkAAOSwQZdcBFg2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gdkAAOSwE9pcBFg~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X28AAOSwqKNcBFhI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yUMAAOSwxFVcBFhV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rPYAAOSwIs1cBFhi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NFIAAOSw-QBcBFhs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eD4AAOSwy3JcBFh2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zVwAAOSwFURcBFh-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4IwAAOSwzgtcBFiK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "32547", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sonnysound8uxj", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6520, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 708.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 708.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 193}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Gibson Les Paul Studio, Faded Cherry, Deluxe Case, Rarely Played, Mint, Ex ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio Faded"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 258, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1200879", "StoreName": "Goldie Store"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 718.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Rarely played,  bedroom musician, non smoking, with deluxe gibson HSC, a few very small nicks and some light wear around the strap holder, no wear on the fretboard or fingerboard, mint condition, ex sound, rarely plated", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
