{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this cool vintage natural relic road worn Olympic White strat body. \u2028 I'm clearing out my parts cupboard to help fund another purchase. This strat body would make an excellent basis for a project strat build. I don't know the brand - it could be Fender - however I'm advertising it as an unknown brand. The body is made from ash and it has a beautifully worn and faded Olympic White finish, showing natural player wear from years and years of use. At a guess I reckon it's from the seventies. It weights a healthy 2.6kg. Pick up from Upper Ferntree Gully or I can post at buyers cost. This item is advertised elsewhere, so I reserve the right to end the auction if the item is no longer available for sale. Check out my other antique and vintage items for auction. Please read the description carefully and view all of the photos prior to placing your bid. If you have any questions or require further information please ask prior to placing your bid. \u2028\u2028I have over 1500 transactions as an eBay member, both as a seller and buyer, with a 100% perfect feedback score. I try to do the right thing with anyone I deal with and I expect the same in return.", "ItemID": "332854020296", "EndTime": "2018-10-31T04:40:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-26T04:40:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-NATURAL-RELIC-STRAT-BODY-OLYMPIC-WHITE-ROAD-WORN-GREAT-PROJECT-/332854020296", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ferntree Gully, VIC", "PaymentMethods": ["MoneyXferAccepted", "PayPal", "COD", "MoneyXferAcceptedInCheckout"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328540202968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwM1gxNjAw/z/rvYAAOSwJuZb0plU/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyM1gxNjAw/z/7hgAAOSwOIlb0plY/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTg2WDE2MDA=/z/vl0AAOSwRrlb0plc/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjI2/z/nxcAAOSw2yVb0plm/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bXIAAOSwFu1b0pls/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nEkAAOSwNWhb0plw/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gVkAAOSwwXRb0pl0/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTkx/z/Iy8AAOSwhu9b0pl5/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HSgAAOSwfvlb0pl9/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjY1/z/edIAAOSwMxJb0pmC/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8~MAAOSwX6Rb0pmH/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qVUAAOSwiuxb0pmm/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "3156", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sar520", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1582, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.1}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 349.01, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 487.0, "CurrencyID": "AUD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 536}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Australia", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "VINTAGE NATURAL RELIC STRAT BODY OLYMPIC WHITE ROAD WORN GREAT PROJECT", "HitCount": 227, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "AU", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 492.0, "CurrencyID": "AUD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good used condition as shown in photos", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
