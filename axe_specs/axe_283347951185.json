{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a well cared for 100% original 1960 Gibson Les Paul Junior. Pots date 6th week of 1960. Serial number is 0 4951. The guitar has moderate wear expected of a 59 year old instrument-- some dings, checks, and some through finish wear. The age checking in the original cherry finish is simply lovely. The hardware is in good shape. The neck feels great with no warps, a very comfortable fat C profile. This Junior weighs only 6 pounds 2 ounces! The P-90 is very hot and spanky! Photo #6 shows the worst of the few cosmetic blemishes. A couple nicks and a small finish scratch between the knobs. This is not through the wood. No headstock or neck issues. Some fretwear up high but not a problem. The neck is straight and the guitar plays with ease, with perfect action at 2/32 inch at the 12thfret bass side. The posts show no signs of leaning. No alligators were killed in the making of the original faux alligator case. This is a sweet all original 1960 Gibson Les Paul Junior that plays like a dream and sounds awesome. It is rare example with no issues, and priced to sell-- check out the other 1960 Juniors available on eBay and that other guitar place.
