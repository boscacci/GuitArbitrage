{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I purchased this Gretsch Duojet 3 years ago. It is from the well known MIJ era in the 1990s. Over the past 3 years my tech in the SF Bay Area has performed the following upgrades: 1. pinned the previously floating bridge - see pics small unobtrusive pins2. replaced the original pickups with newly purchased TV Jones Powertrons ( the original pickups are known to be the one weak spot in these MIJ versions )3. replaced the original plastic input jack with a new nickel well made one. 4. replaced the forward strap pin ( original in case )5. performed a full setup. He specifically recommended not changing the tuners as they are well made and hold tuning well. The frets show little wear. The pics show how nice the dark dense rosewood board is. I have it set with 10s but use a 48 ga for the 6th string-but have also used a 10.5 set in the past. The action is an incredibly low 1.25 mm for the 1 st string at the 12th fret and 1.5 mm for the 6th with smooth bending, excellent intonation and no fretting out. This can be raised if you prefer. One of the most difficult thing for me to let go of is the incredible original roller bridge. The Bigsby action is awesome - especially compared with more typical tune-a-matics. The weight is a comfortable 8.1 pounds. The original quality hard shell case is included. I have gigged with this approximately 10 times with a fender deluxe reverb and a Roland JC-40 and the tone is sweet with excellent smooth playability. Please see my feedback as I have owned more than a hundred guitars and sold many nice ones. Unlike the typical ebay guitar this one will need no work of any kind! Everything is already just right. I am not an ebay store and I know guitars. I will not allow a buyer to be unhappy. No risks here and you know what you're getting. I know how to pack a guitar correctly and will use UPS. I have approximately $ 1800 invested in this Gretsch with the upgrades and it was well worth it. My asking price is a full $400 less than others from this nice MIJ era. All reasonable offers will be considered. Continental US sales and shipping please. Thank-you for your interest.
