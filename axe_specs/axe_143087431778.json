{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Rogue Electric Sitar / Guitar(6 String with 13 Drone Strings)Very unique sound! Once tuned (in whatever key you want) and adjusted to your liking, this beautiful red crinkle solid body can produce some very \"real acoustic sitar\" sounding music! It is like new. I played it a while but my health isn't what it use to be and I have to unload some of my guitars and other stringed instruments and equipment. This was not at all cheap when I bought it, however, I am pricing it to sell. It is in pristine condition! Stand is not included. I am, however, including the canvas bag it's in. The bag has Fender written on the front side. I photographed the back of the bag to prevent confusion. These are very sought after instruments as they are no longer in manufacture. It won't last long at this price!!!Good Luck!This could be your lucky day...
