{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "What I have here up for sale is a 6 and 12 string double neck guitar that is built really good constructively. I'm gonna say they built this one pretty solid. I do recommend a good tune up and have the nut on the 12 string shaved down. This is the 1st double neck I have ever owned considering I have a few Les Pauls, I do not know if this thing is wired correctly, all eletronics work fine..The pickups sound good through my 76 Marshall. I was going to make this a project including to change the tuning keys and the above mentioned, a tune up, but got sidetracked because of increased health issues that i am struggling with. I decided that somebody else will put this to great use. I forgot to mention that this guitar has 22 frets! That's one feature the original double neck should have featured. No returns. Please pay ASAP please. Any questions are welcome and I thank you all for your time looking...Happy New Year.", "ItemID": "292920987874", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T02:30:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T02:30:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FAKE-GIBSON-DOUBLE-NECK-SG-1275-Copy-Thru-Neck-built-solid-/292920987874", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fort Howard, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929209878748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R3gAAOSw8~hcPmIh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SQEAAOSw0VxcPmIo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XnMAAOSwg0dcPmIB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RjIAAOSw8NNcPmIv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2-EAAOSwuZ9cPmIw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kUcAAOSw56BcPmIb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EWAAAOSwuQhcPmIw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D8EAAOSwxJ9cPmHk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r1YAAOSwNTNcPmIp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g50AAOSwgotcPmIE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HJkAAOSw7OdcPmIS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9FoAAOSwI01cPmTZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "21052", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mafiameltdown", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 728, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 520.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 520.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 454}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FAKE GIBSON DOUBLE NECK SG 1275 Copy_Thru-Neck, built solid!!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Chibson"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["12-string &amp; 6-String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Double Neck"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 368, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 530.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
