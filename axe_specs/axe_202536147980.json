{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "EXCEPTIONAL NEAR MINT CONDITION, GREAT PLAYER! WOW, 11 YEARS OLD AND LOOKS NEW! This is an IBANEZ ARTCORE SERIES ELECTRIC GUITAR in TRANSPARENT CHERRY RED FINISH. Made in, I believe, 2007. Model AS73 TCR-12-01. 100% Original and Complete. This guitar is truly show room clean. The back of the neck is perfectly SMOOTH! The frets and finger board look NEW! Looks like it has barely been played. First class guitar, not stamped 'used' or '2nd' like so many here on ebay. It comes with the EPIPHONE ES 335 STYLE hard shell case you see in the pictures. It is a TKL case that was made in Canada by Boblin (the best on the market). Professionally set up. Everything works as it should... electronics, truss rod, bridge, tuners, etc. I have serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the neck and body, cleaned and conditioned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the frets, installed new strings (D'Addario 10-52), adjusted bridge/truss rod/ intonation, etc. She is ready to play and PLAYS GREAT!! Buyer pays $39.95 shipping, insurance, packaging and handling to contiguous 48 states. Items over 2 lbs will ship Fed Ex ground, (no PO Boxes). Thanks for looking and good luck.
