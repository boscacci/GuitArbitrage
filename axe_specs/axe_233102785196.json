{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for an original Made in Japan in early 1980s Yamaha model SC400 solid body electric guitar. This guitar is used and has some dings and scratches here and there and \"belt buckle\" rush on the back of the body, but none of the dings and scratches are really deep and it is just a natural \"relic\" and some Custom Shop would charge you a $1000 to make your brand new guitar to look just like that:))) Really nice Mahogany body and set in Mahogany neck with very good rosewood fretboard with pearloid dot inlays. The neck is super comfortable! Everything looks factory original. This guitar is pretty light at about 7 pounds. The action is low and the neck is true and the truss rod is working so this guitar plays like butter and sounds great. You can find all the great reviews and some specs about this guitars if you do some research online. No case or gigbag, but it will be packed for shipping really well.Buyer will pay $30 shipping cost within continental US and $99 should cover most of the international shipping. Some remote countries like Russia, Australia, New Zealand shipping cost would be a little higher like $129. Of course it will be less to Canada like $69 or so. Shipping cost includes insurance. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "233102785196", "EndTime": "2019-01-27T21:08:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T21:08:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ORIGINAL-VINTAGE-80S-MADE-JAPAN-YAMAHA-SC400-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-/233102785196", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Seymour, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331027851968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/eUAAAOSwuUlb6DXq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/miMAAOSwu9Jb6DXw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/W4YAAOSwHglb6DX1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/yS4AAOSwEf5b6DX8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/GnUAAOSwY2Jb6DYH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/yUUAAOSwEf5b6DYL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/M1AAAOSwiWZb6DYQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/kVEAAOSwxtVb6DYS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/rewAAOSwxZxb6DYW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/SQUAAOSw5Xpb6DYg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/eZgAAOSwuUlb6DYl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/SCoAAOSwH0Vb6DYo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "06483", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "edz7777", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 858, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 349.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 349.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1081}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ORIGINAL VINTAGE '80S MADE IN JAPAN YAMAHA SC400 ELECTRIC GUITAR!!!
