{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is your opportunity to own a true vintage 1974 year model Les Paul custom in highly desirable Alpine White. This has had a small professional head stock repair that looks nearly perfect... see pictures for reference.As you may know the serial numbers were very light on these and this one is no exception. With the one light coat of lacquer from the small repair it is nearly invisible. The serial number was written inside pot cavity long ago, see pictures. The finish has many small marks and such but is very clean for a '74 overall. The gold hardware is much better than most. Original Grovers work nicely... These pickups sound like no other. Pots and pickups are original , solder joints are all untouched and date to early 1974. Pickup covers were in the case and were re-installed. Everything else is original as far as I can tell... Comes with original Gibson strings, brochure and Original Gibson case, all straps in perfect working condition. Frets are original and show some slight wear with plenty of life left.", "ItemID": "192788787174", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T02:54:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T19:24:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1974-Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom-Alpine-White-/192788787174", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Irvine, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927887871748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/AOgAAOSwZelcOj5y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTc4/z/giYAAOSwZj5cOj9P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTg2/z/9dMAAOSwjrFcOj5r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTM4/z/QSsAAOSw9g1cOj9K/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjE3/z/DLkAAOSwkjJcOj-L/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTI1/z/G44AAOSwAThcOj85/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTUy/z/S4gAAOSwIABcOj9S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzNFgxNjAw/z/p6UAAOSwxrJcOj5N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "92618", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jjrgranados", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 150, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4495.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4495.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 192}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "*Vintage* 1974 Gibson Les Paul Custom Alpine White", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1974"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 442, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used in Very good Condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
