{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Gibson SG Faded from 2002 with the rare, first year only ebony fretboard. It plays great, and has a lot of fret life left. The ebony fretboard has recently been cleaned with lemon oil and had the frets polished. I replaced the electronics with a Premium SG Kit from Stewart-MacDonald that features CTS pots, Orange Drop capacitors, Switchcraft switch and jack, and vintage style push back wire. It sounds great, with very little interference buzzing or feeding back. The guitar has been used less than an hour since I put the electronics in. The bridge pickup is a Stewart-MacDonald Parsons Street Hot bridge pickup. It is a very accurate replica of a late 50s PAF but a little bit hotter. The neck pickup is a Gibson 490R. They both have different sounds, the neck sounding better for metal and thicker rock and roll, and the bridge having a clearer sound and being better for 60s rock and roll and blues. See my Youtube video: https://youtu.be/8RoUgTtfRlw This guitar had seen some stage use before I got it and the neck had been broken and repaired. The job that was done on it was professional, and very well done. I can see some indentations under the paint by the neck from where screws were put in. Other than this, I can't see any cracks in the neck. The body and neck are highly resonant despite the repair. It has a Gotoh tailpiece that I installed that also gives the guitar great sustain. There are four screw holes on the front of the guitar from where I had a Bigsby installed. On the back, there are two screw holes and an area where the paint is worn through. The guitar was refinished, I think at the time the neck was repaired. I have polished it so that it looks pretty good. It didn't have a rear control plate when I got the guitar, so I made one from galvanized sheet steel that I filed off at the corners. It is velcroed securely and fits flush to the body. The frets are in good shape. No fretting out all the way to the highest fret. The neck is a nice rounded shape, what Gibson referred to as a 50s shape but not a baseball bat. Really, this is a great player SG and a rare one with the sweet ebony fretboard for a player guitar price. It also comes with an Epiphone SG hardshell case in good condition, with a lock and two keys. Please email with any questions. I'm selling to the Continental U.S. only, with a flat fee of $70 shipping using a good quality guitar shipping box and fully insured.", "ItemID": "233020752093", "EndTime": "2018-12-03T01:00:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-26T01:00:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2002-Gibson-SG-Faded-Ebony-Fretboard-Custom-/233020752093", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Austin, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330207520938080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fvIAAOSwCPZb-0Yz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NkgAAOSwF5Vb-0ZJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7EMAAOSwR0db-0bM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GUAAAOSw5Epb-0fo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rIUAAOSwUMBb-0cD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mS4AAOSwBZxb-0bO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DUgAAOSwfX9b-0bR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UigAAOSwt~1b-0cY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oqsAAOSwatBb-0cl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aT8AAOSwHSdb-0ec/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7KkAAOSwXedb-0fb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bRYAAOSwAx9b-0hN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "78741", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "darenaissanceman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 352, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 32, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 370.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 370.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 454}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2002 Gibson SG Faded Ebony Fretboard Custom", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 909, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "AF", "AM", "AZ", "BD", "BT", "CN", "GE", "IN", "KZ", "KR", "KG", "MV", "MN", "NP", "PK", "RU", "LK", "TJ", "TM", "UZ", "AL", "AD", "BY", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "EE", "GI", "GR", "GG", "HU", "JE", "LV", "LI", "LT", "LU", "MK", "MT", "MD", "ME", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SJ", "UA", "GB", "VA"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
