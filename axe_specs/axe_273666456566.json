{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Les Paul Traditional. Very good condition but has a few minor nick and bumps from normal play wear. This particular Traditional is a special run and has a body that's all mahogany, no maple cap. There are two minor dings on the edge of the body shown in the photos. It features an XL Profile neck, it's a thick chunky neck that's also wider at the nut than a regular Gibson. Good for wide bends and greater playing comfort for players with big hands. I would describe the tonal quality of this guitar as being full though with some top end twang. It's non-chambered, solid all the way through. I don't know the weight, it's heavy but not boat anchor heavy, it's manageable. Fretboard is clean, Fretwork is impeccable. Action is very low. It's a shame this guitar didn't get played much. The '59 Tribute pickups sound great, like a traditional PAF but a little cleaner. All hardware is original except the Kluson tuners. The Tronical auto tuners were swapped out for vintage style Klusons (which everybody seems to like better). The bore is the same for both so if you want to swap the Tronicals back in it takes about 5 minutes with socket & screwdriver, it's very easy. The factory Tronical auto tuners will be included. FedEx shipping is $70 to lower 48 states.No bidders with less than 50 feedbacks.I'm happy to answer any questions.Thanks for looking.", "ItemID": "273666456566", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T03:43:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T03:43:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2015-Gibson-Les-Paul-Traditional-mahogany-BIG-NECK-XL-Profile-/273666456566", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kansas City, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736664565668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/a6sAAOSw5i5cRTxK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2ODU=/z/WukAAOSw8PJcRTxX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xoAAAOSwDsZcRTxN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Wn0AAOSw76JcRTxQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1MjQ=/z/C30AAOSwsTJcRTxV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3e4AAOSwMpFcRUA2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BcUAAOSwFAtcRUAW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3PEAAOSwPGtcRUAe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xzYAAOSwIqxcRUAO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H48AAOSwtvZcRUAu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R4oAAOSwrClcRUAl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jZoAAOSwH4dcRTxh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "64111", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "davidr4148", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 591, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1127.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1127.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 222}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2015 Gibson Les Paul Traditional mahogany BIG NECK XL Profile", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Traditional"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Clear"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 341, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1152.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "very good condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
