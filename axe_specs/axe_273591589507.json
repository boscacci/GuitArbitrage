{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "One-Owner (me), ordered from Carvin about 18 years ago. Thick flame maple top, Carry-through 24-fret maple neck with mahogany wings, gorgeous transparent blue. Super fast low action and incredible access to all frets, light weight and KILLER tone and sustain. Tune-O-Matic bridge with individually adjustable string saddle for perfect intonation. (in the pics, in addition to the reflection of the chandelier, what looks like crazing or cracks is actually the reflection of a stipple ceiling texture... there are NO cracks or crazing) This was one of my main playing guitars, some tiny finish scratches and dings that are nearly impossible to photo (see pics); played, but cared-for not yet \"road worn\". One of the string lock knobs is slightly bent but is not noticeable and doesn\u2019t effect functionality at all, Sperzels are an easy and inexpensive swap out, but it\u2019s not necessary. You can see where I had some stickers on the case at one time (can be cleaned or covered with your own stickers). 2 humbuckers with similar controls as a Les Paul. I was interested in the Gibson until I played one of these, then I immediately ordered this from the Carvin factory, serial #63007. I will consider reasonable offers and will provide additional info/pics. I don't want to sell this. Unfortunately I have to. See more treasures in my other listings!On Dec-06-18 at 01:10:59 PST, seller added the following information: I forgot to mention (it was 18 years ago...) that I had a luthier remove a small amount of wood from under the tune-o-matic bridge in order to get the action as low as possible when I first had it set up. You can see it if you zoom in, but it's extremely difficult to spot. Please keep this in mind when bidding. I will provide additional pics upon request, but it's nearly impossible for me to photograph the spot.
