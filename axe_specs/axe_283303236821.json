Here\u2019s a lovely 2005 Gibson ES-335 style BB King \u201cLucille\u201d guitar in excellent condition, in her original hard case. She\u2019s got that killer Ebony finish, free of dings and dents and obviously played sparingly, and always carefully. These double-cutaway Lucilles reputedly have semi-hollow bodies but they\u2019re obviously loaded with hardware and technology along with the pearl and ebony and hard maple\u2014this guitar tips the scales at 9 pounds 11.6 ounces, fully 6 ounces more than my slab-bodied 1952 Les Paul Model Goldtop (also for sale here soon). Amongst the high-tech features of this instrument are the tune-a-matic bridge and tuneable stop tailpiece, two covered humbuckers and stereo electronics capability (note the twin jacks in pic #9). See pic #10 for the complete list of the Lucille\u2019s technical specifications. In pic #8 you\u2019ll see that the serial number of this guitar is 02645715. For many decades the Gibson guitar company has been internationally renowned for taking an abstruse, cryptic, and obfuscatory approach to their serial numbering. But I happen to know the secret handshake, and 02645715 means this guitar was finished on September 21stof 2005, and was the 215thinstrument stamped that day in the Nashville (not Kalamazoo) factory, by a guy named Jerry (not Augie). I think. This would make a great Christmas gift to that special jazz player or Gibson collector in your life\u2014it\u2019s good enough for BB King! Please hit the Buy It Now button within the next few days if you want me to get this guitar to you before Christmas. I\u2019ll be on family vacation myself, and unable to ship guitars between December 20 and December 27. If you buy a guitar during that time, I won\u2019t be able to ship it until after December 28. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all!", "ItemID": "283303236821", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T05:43:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T03:13:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2005-Gibson-BB-King-Lucille-Guitar-Exc-Cond-Lowest-BIN-Price-/283303236821", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Montpelier, Vermont", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833032368218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/74kAAOSwzTFcExVx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dmAAAOSwg05cExV5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Pn4AAOSwOchcExWI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4kIAAOSwF5VcExWH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g1MAAOSwVEFcExWR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/egAAAOSw-ghcExWU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HfcAAOSwezRcExWb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4AAAAOSwPYRcExWm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/djMAAOSw8BdcExWv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VYcAAOSwysFcExXh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ojYAAOSwvNVcExXq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FnwAAOSw6X1cExXy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "05602", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rawburl", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 607, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***4", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 17}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2005 Gibson BB King Lucille Guitar Exc Cond Lowest BIN Price!\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-355"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Stereo sound capability"]}]}, "HitCount": 111, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
