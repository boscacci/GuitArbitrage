{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Very nice US made G&L Comanche electric gutiar I believe this was made in early 2013 Alpine White with matching painted headstock Custom pickguard (still has plastic under some of the knobs) MFD Z Coil pickups with tone switch Sperzel USA locking tuners Guitar weight is about 8 pounds 10 ounces I have not heard back from G&L regarding the neck specs, so I did some measurements The radius is 7 1/2\" - First fret measurement is about .83 and the 12th fret is about .96 - Frets are .110 From what I found on the internet, this should be a custom order #2 Vintage C neck (feels C, not V to me) instead of the standard 12\" radius I bought this used from GC about 8 months ago with the intention of it being my ONLY guitar. BIG GAS attack hit shortly afterwards and it really has just sat and I am now thinning out the herd The guitar is in pretty nice shape. Very little markings on the frets and the worse I see is some wear at the points from a wrench or socket on the locking tuner nuts Please feel free to ask questions Also being sold locally in Chicagoland area. Local pickup of this is ok if we agree upon logistics before you bid. Local pickups need to pay cash since I cannot provide Ebay or Paypal with delivery confirmation details Shipping includes signature confirmation and insurance, so cost is a little more", "ItemID": "113539735629", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T03:44:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-09T17:03:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-L-USA-Comanche-Alpine-White-7-1-2-C-Rosewood-Painted-HS-Guitar-Strat-Legacy-/113539735629", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135397356298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY1WDE2MDA=/z/Z9oAAOSw9m5cH95a/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q4QAAOSwEJ1cH95d/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gOAAAOSwESRcH95g/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~Z0AAOSwyPFcH95j/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEyWDE2MDA=/z/XrcAAOSwhfRcH95m/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTI5WDE2MDA=/z/upsAAOSw1qhcH95o/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY1WDE2MDA=/z/1bMAAOSwsGpcH95q/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60601", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "scrooge.and.marley", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3218, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 848.44, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 848.44, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 264}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G&L USA Comanche Alpine White 7 1/2\" C Rosewood Painted HS Guitar Strat Legacy ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 226, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
