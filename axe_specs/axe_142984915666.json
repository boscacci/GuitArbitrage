{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Les Paul \u201cBlack Beauty\u201d standard circa 1990\u2019s. This \u201cBlack Beauty\u201dEbony, was made in what they say were the good wood years for Gibson. The 1990\u2019s is often cited as some of the best years that Gibson was making guitars so I\u2019ve been told. This guitar is original, except for the tuners. These were upgraded to Schaller, German engineered tuners. The original tuners are included should you want to change it back to its original state. It is outfitted with Vintage \u201cHard Rockin\u2019 Steel\u201d number 9 strings. My preference is to have 10\u2019s! An extra set of Vintage \u201cHard Rockin\u2019 Steel\u201d strings are included. Also included is a DiMarzio quick release guitar strap as pictured!The original brown leather Gibson USA case with pink lining is OK shape. It has had a lot of road wear and been cosmetically fixed with brown duct tape on the underside. Let\u2019s remember that this guitar is over 20 years old and at many loved gigs.The guitar itself is in great condition for an over 20-year-old guitar. It plays like butter if you like fast action and sounds awesome through a Marshall JCM800 amp! This guitar has minor play wear but no fret wear, with no major dings or dents. A small amount of buckle rash. Although you cannot see it in the photos due to the mirror like finish, there are very light scratches and checking on the front. Also, there are some manufactures paint flaws. One being on the inside cut-a-way as shown in the photo and on the back side where it looks a little hazed. There is also a tiny paint blip under the strings. Again, these are manufacture flaws and very hard to see in the photo due to the mirror like finish on this guitar.The front of the headstock shows some wear and the headstock itself had a repair 10 years ago.
