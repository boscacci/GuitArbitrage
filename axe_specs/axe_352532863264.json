But time is taking over and it's time for this guitar to go to somebody with much more time than I do. So here goes a awesome what used to be and what was a custom shop instrument. Guitar is tele shaped with a beautiful flame Maple neck no structural issues that I can see.

Please check out the photographs the guitars being sold as a project as is sold no returns. Also to know that there's a bit of paint chipping around the tone pot which appear to have been opened a little bit for some big pots please check out the photographs. Guitars being sold as a project as is no returns. This was once a $3,000 guitar years back it's time for her to go back to making music. Also the guitar will come with a very cool Fender advertisement that I just found right about the time of the listing.. Also there are no pickups. And I'm not sure what parts are there are not there. I believe everything should be there minus the pickups maybe the switch tip. Also that mead binder is not included in this auction.
