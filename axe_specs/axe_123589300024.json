{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I got this from a widow, cleaning out a room at home after her husband died. He played this in bands throughout the 50's -70's. Apparently, he removed the Kay logo; but he did a nice job, and the headstock shows no sign of it. I do not have the knob for the pickup selector switch, and someone put a fender trapeze tailpiece on instead of the original. I'll leave it to the new owner to correct these details. There is fret wear in the first 3 frets only. The rest are excellent. Looks like he mostly played open chords. Electronically, all volume and tone as well as the pick-up selector switch works fine. The neck is fine, as is the neck body joint. It has a lovely tone unamplified. We put 10 gauge strings on it, and set it up, as well as cleaned it. Very nice! It does not include a case. All in all, this is a very nice vintage piece to add to your collection!", "ItemID": "123589300024", "EndTime": "2019-01-24T00:18:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T21:52:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1950s-Kay-Thin-Twin-Jimmy-Reed-Semi-Hollow-Electric-Guitar-EXCELLENT-/123589300024", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Burnt Hills, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235893000248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/cnEAAOSwQZdcHp8i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/U4UAAOSwiwZcHp9I/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/rqwAAOSw1ExcHp9d/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/K8IAAOSw9lBcHp9v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/Dm0AAOSwS4VcHp-N/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/OicAAOSwzZNcHp-d/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/Sg4AAOSwCWNcHp-1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "12027", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ricademymusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 83, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1050.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1050.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 208}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1950s Kay Thin Twin Jimmy Reed Semi-Hollow Electric Guitar EXCELLENT!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Kay"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1950's"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 222, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
