{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a rare Peavey Generation Custom. The \"Custom\" was a short run with HSH pickup configuration and Piezo pickups on the neck, body and saddles (for acoustic modeling). The guitar itself is quite a stunner (the tobacco burst finish being the rarest and nicest looking) with double bound body, gorgeous quilt maple top, a killer satin neck with dark rosewood fingerboard, GraphTech nut and saddles and very nice pro-level pots and hardware. The strings run straight through the body and the sustain is huge. The innovation in this guitar is also unreal. Piezo pickups on the neck, body and bridge accurately replicate the sound of an acoustic guitar through dynamics control and by reacting to the guitar's body and string vibrations. The ceramic magnet pickups are amazingly clear and very musical (very Fender-y sound, clear and crisp without biting your head off). The magnetic pickups are controlled via the main volume and tone pots and a 5 way selector. A separate pot controls the volume of the Piezos and smaller 3 way toggle allows you to select the output mix (magnetic only/magnetic and acoustic/acoustic only). With a standard mono instrument cable plugged, the volume controls can be used to blend both outputs providing an effectively unlimited variety of tones. With a stereo cable plugged, the 3-way switch enables or disables either or both outputs and the volume controls allow controlling how much signal reaches your amp/mixer/etc. (You can run 2 separate guitar cables into an A/B stomp box, mixer or run them into two separate amps.) You can make it sound like anything you want! This guitar is in near mint condition, plastic is still on the covers.
