{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I don't have a clue what model this is. I believe it is a Norma Teisco guitar. I've seen one at a shop in Nashville and it had a Teisco tag glued on it's head where this one appears to be missing something that was glued to it. It plays alright. If you just want a cool looking guitar that feels neat and you can chord on or depend on for light riffs and licks - it'll work fine. But, you can't really tear it up on this one. It seems like the intonation in the higher frets get weird if your playing fast. Otherwise, it's pretty alright. As you should be able to see in the photos, the hardware has had some oxidation about it and the body has some scratches and abrasions in several places. None of these are distracting. I kind of like the way it looks, to be honest. Anyways, I'm doing buy-it-now with free shipping for now. But, I might update shipping info and set it to calculate according to location with a lower price in a day or two.
