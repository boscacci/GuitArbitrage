{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "CASIO PG-380 in Black, manufactured by Ibanez in Japan... as used by jazz guitarist, Stanley Jordon and by Bob Wier of Greatful Dead. Uses any 9v power supply, or 9v battery. Untested synthesizer sounds. Comes with a nice hard shell case.I am selling various musical equipment including guitars, acoustic guitars, basses, bass amps and pre-amps, effects pedals, speaker cabinets, raw vintage speakers, SKB racks, rack equipment, mixing boards, recording equipment, snakes, power amps, compressors, etc. All were purchased for personal use or collection. It all must go because I am retired, downsizing, and moving. They are all in good working condition unless stated otherwise. Some are new in original packaging or in nearly mint condition. Please check the individual item descriptions and pictures for details. I brought this particular PG-380 from a local music store. It is cosmetically in super fine shape for a guitar this old, with the usual fine polishing swirls. No major dings. The neck finish is mint and the neck adjustment works without issue. Locking mechanism at the nut and tremolo bridge keeps it right in tune. Does not include the whammy bar which has so often been lost along the way by owners of these instruments. Replacement wb's are available at Allparts. Owners Manuals are available on eBay. It has been stored for 5 years. Presently un tested. Untested onboard synthesizer sounds The guitar portion performed exactly as it should and sounds better than a Strat, in my opinion. This guitar is so cosmetically nice that I would spend the money in a heart beat to have the caps replaced and serviced if I were going to keep it. There are more than a few articles on the web on how to cure the triggering problem. Everything from powering it up and leaving it on for a day or two to charge up the capacitors, to actually replacing capacitors. ...Audio Technology at 5027 Industrial Way, Wall, NJ is experienced in repairing these guitars.

The following Quote is From Grant Muller from his article on PG 380's.. \" These guitars were made by Ibanez for Casio using high end components and is a great ?strat-like? guitar even without the synthesizer. PG380 guitars sold for $1500 when new in 1987. The Casio PG-380 is a guitar that translates the notes you pick on the strings into MIDI Notes. Think of it like a Keytar, only its ACTUALLY a guitar. You may think that the name brand somehow reduces the quality of this particular instrument, but you'd be mistaken; this baby is top of the line. It can translate amplitude, hammer-ons, and string bends with very little latency. I'd soon find out how hard to find, and how expensive, buying one of these would be.\" This PG380 is in exceptionally fine cosmetic conditionI SO GRAB THIS COLLECTIBLE GUITAR/synth UP NOW.
