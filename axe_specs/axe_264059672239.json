{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Used Ibanez S520EX black with tiger claw inlay at 12th fret. Has the original very excellent functioning zero resistance tremolo bridge with the zp spring lock that adds resistance and keeps trem in tune by adding resistance to the diving action. With the spring removed, it becomes a free floating tremolo like a Floyd Rose. The zero resistance system keep the guitar in tune really well once tuned correctly. When the ZP spring is in, the trem block should just lightly touch it at the bar side connecting the two springs - (download instructions from Ibanez.com the manufacturer's website). The neck is in good condition, the frets have a lot of life left in them. The fret edges were filed to make them smoother so the binding may show scuffs from that but the neck plays really well. If the action is made very very low the strings may buzz at the 3rd or 5th fret. At current very playable setting that is not a problem. The pickups are generic humbuckers Kmise. The neck pickup sounds really good. The bridge one has less low end and more top end frequencies. Being a used guitar there are a few normal usage scratches here and there but no major nicks or dings that I can tell. There is an easily removable screensaving plastic (from the palm pilot era) pasted as a pickguard. Recommended to download the instructions for the Zero Resistance trem from the Ibanez.com website.
