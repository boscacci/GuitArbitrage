{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2017 Gibson Les Paul Classic. Beautiful Goldtop. Dark rosewood fingerboard. Nice color to the inlays (NOT yellow looking). 60's neck. Excellent condition other than a tiny ding behind the tailpiece - hard to see, but there. No other dings or play wear - really nice! It weighs 9.1 lbs (accurate postal scale). A bone nut has been professionally installed. The bridge and tailpiece were replaced with very nice chrome set used on the newer HP models. The pickups were changed to a 490R / 498T set with covers, along with coil taps and phase switching (all 4 knobs push/pull). Truss rod cover replaced with a blank one (original included). The tuners have been upgraded to chrome Grover Locking (newer style with thumbwheels). Not pictured - but I will include the 4 original pots and 2 orange capacitors, and 4 speed knobs. Comes with the original brown hard case, manual/tag, and Gibson multi-tool (see pics - nothing else is included). The guitar plays great with low action, and sounds great! I always pack well and ship fast. PayPal only. Lower 48 U.S. only. Check my feedback and buy with confidence. Thanks for looking, and please let me know if you have any questions.", "ItemID": "153346960690", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T21:52:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T22:17:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2017-Gibson-Les-Paul-Classic-Goldtop-upgrades-Case-and-candy-included-/153346960690", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Richmond, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533469606908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/GpEAAOSw-elcRPGG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/2xEAAOSwSONcRPGv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/k~oAAOSwvapcRPGO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/pqUAAOSwkelcRPGY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/e0QAAOSwisxcRPHH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/8TsAAOSwpYxcRPHw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/9QgAAOSws~pcRPGm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/-UMAAOSwckVcRPG8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/F6QAAOSwvdFcRPHQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/ozcAAOSw10VcRPHf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/M0cAAOSwtutcRPH2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/VIAAAOSwIApcRPHW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "77406", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "robertb2606", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1489, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 287}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2017 Gibson Les Paul Classic Goldtop with upgrades  Case and candy included.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Classic"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 348, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition other than a tiny ding behind the tailpiece - hard to see, but there.
