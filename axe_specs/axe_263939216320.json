Lawsuit Era \"Open Book Head Stock\" VenturaMid 1970s Ventura SG Electric GuitarMade In JapanOriginal FinishNo Repairs Includes what appears to be the original hard case PLEASE DO NOT mistake picture glare for flaws.. YOUR SEEING CLOUDS FROM THE SKY.. If you think your seeing something not mentioned in this listing, please ask!!There are lots of pics, so when you receive it, its exactly what you expected, if not better. No surprises with this sale.. Buy with confidence!Here's The Run Down:This is a Mid 70s Ventura Lawsuit Era SG Style Guitar that sounds, looks and plays great! It is 45+/- years old, so there will be cosmetic flaws here and there, but still in respectful condition for its age. Flaws will consist of marks, scuffs, scratches, dings, chips and pick scratching on the guard from being played/handled, but nothing that would effect the integrity of the guitar (see pics). There are minor neck pocket finish cracks as most end up having (pictured). There is some fret wear, but plays to my liking as it sits (see pics). There is some discoloration/corrosion of the hardware. I tried to take really good pics, so you can zoom in and judge its overall condition for yourself (see pics). There are NO repairs or changes other than changed tuning pegs and possibly the nut. All electronics are original, repair free and operate perfectly. If your looking for a Super Cool, Early Japanese SG Style Guitar that your friends most likely don't have, this would make a great addition to your collection!This Ventura SG sounds and plays great! Although I think its set up great, everyone has their own preferences. If your not happy with its set up, it will be your responsibility and cost to have it set up to your liking. The neck is straight and the truss rod operates as it should. All electronics are original with factory solder joints and operate perfectly! Freshly set up with super slinky 9's The Included Original Hard Case is used and vintage, but in good usable condition and fits the guitar properly . No issues, but there will be flaws here and there from use, moving it around and age. Everything operates as it should, and has never had, nor does it have any breaks or repairs unless noted above.Make sure you view all of the pics and ask questions if you have any concerns before buying.I will ship this item over seas, but you must contact me for a shipping quote before buying.
