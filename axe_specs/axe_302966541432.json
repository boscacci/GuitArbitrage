{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gorgeous purple PRS SE Torero with Floyd Rose bridge, neck-through body construction and PRS SE gig bag; the whammy bar is included. Guitar is in really good shape. Didn\u2019t notice any dings, dents or anything like that. You know the info on Toreros. They\u2019re \u201ca shredder\u2019s dream\u201d says Mr. PRS himself. But here\u2019s some details: mahogany body with flame-maple veneer, 25 1/2\u201d scale length, jumbo frets, master volume and tone, 3-way blade switch, standard PRS tuners and standard strap buttons. I put on the cool PRS truss rod cover. It came with a blank one. Kept in smoke-free home, no pets and in the gig bag most of the time. Played it maybe five times. I bought this on eBay back in April and just haven\u2019t played it. And I\u2019m not a shredder. Haven\u2019t played many of my guitars, to be honest. The former owner switched out the EMG pickups for the Bare Knuckle Black Hawk pickups in white. He got rid of the EMGs so I don\u2019t have them. See address of link below for more intel on the pups... https://www.bareknucklepickups.co.uk/pickup/humbucker/black-hawk The pickups are pricey, they\u2019re an upgrade. I found a white one online and it was $170 for just the bridge pickup. Upwards of $290 for a pair. So it\u2019s a great, good looking guitar but I just don\u2019t play it enough and could use the money. Good luck bidding!!", "ItemID": "302966541432", "EndTime": "2018-11-22T19:57:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-21T03:08:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-SE-Torero-Purple-w-Bare-Knuckle-Black-Hawk-Pickups-/302966541432", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Crystal Lake, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029665414328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9RwAAOSwbF1bmxu-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ICwAAOSwBydbmxu6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2Y0AAOSwm9dbmxuy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KHMAAOSwV-5bmxu2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j84AAOSwMudbmxuz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mw0AAOSwMsJbmxu5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qokAAOSwSSNbmxu7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RLgAAOSwkHJbmxu3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GfEAAOSwCE5bmxu1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/910AAOSwxMRbmxvA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ytgAAOSwiZVbmygv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60014", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dtreedrdg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 270, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 457}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS SE Torero, Purple w/ Bare Knuckle Black Hawk Pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SE Torrero"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Purple"]}]}, "HitCount": 35, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
