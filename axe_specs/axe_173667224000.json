{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage 1988 USA Made Guild X-500 Jazz guitar. Killer instrument. Big body with very comfortable smaller feeling neck shape. Sounds and plays great. Has had a small crack at the neck near the nut that has been professionally repaired. The back of the neck could have been over sprayed with lacquer to make the repair more invisible but it was decided to leave the original finish as is. Now the repair can be felt as a very slight hairline chip in the finish. Also shows slight play wear with some slight dings and imperfections here and there. This doesn't affect the playability or sound of this instrument at all. Stays in tune great and has no issues. Has almost no fret wear. Has been professionally setup. Great guitar and no reserve. Thanks for looking.", "ItemID": "173667224000", "EndTime": "2018-12-07T01:53:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-30T01:53:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1988-Guild-X-500-Archtop-Jazzbox-Electric-Guitar-Jazz-Rockabilly-Guitar-/173667224000", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Greer, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736672240008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/i7cAAOSwHORcAJZD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/sdQAAOSw4VpcAJXn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/UW8AAOSwcDdcAJXr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/x9MAAOSw-GNcAJXu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/QMcAAOSwjMtcAJXx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/RuQAAOSwAQVcAJX1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/CEwAAOSwTDpcAJX4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/oOwAAOSwFURcAJX6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ZOwAAOSwE9pcAJX-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/UBoAAOSwKOZcAJYB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29650", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "brandonblues", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1023, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 23, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1302.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1302.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1143}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1988 Guild X-500 Archtop Jazzbox Electric Guitar Jazz Rockabilly Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Guild"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 583, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1327.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
