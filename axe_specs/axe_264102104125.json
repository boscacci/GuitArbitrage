Gibson - 2013 Les Paul Traditional 2013 Gibson USA Les Paul Traditional gloss Chicago Blue . Great Condition overall!

There are some surface swirls, small depressions and hairline scratches from being polished but these are nothing serious. The bound Carved Top is Made of lightly figured maple and the body is mahogany that is not chambered or weight relieved. The guitar features a rounded 50's profile mahogany neck with 22 frets, rosewood fingerboard, pearloid trapezoid inlays, Corian nut, vintage style tuners, chrome hardware and a Nashville bridge.
