{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "No scratches or dents and near new condition. It's a limit edition custom shop ES-175 VS. New Power-Bright strings and plays great. Only modification is I have a nice roller bridge on there. It will be wrapped up by itself with the guitar when shipped because its just sitting there and is no glued or attached to the face of course. No damage and everything looks like new. No guitar case comes with it, just the guitar and the strap. The frets show no wear because I did not play this much because I have a lot of guitars but wanted an ES-175 because it sound so good with blues and jazz. This is my only hollow body but I just play the solid body Fenders and Gibsons I have now. US continental orders, and shipping is UPS unless you want to arrange pick up here or use your own Fed-X account or whatever. I will pack it fine with bobble wrap and double box it too.
