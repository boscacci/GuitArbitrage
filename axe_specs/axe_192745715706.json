{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a beautiful BLUE early 90's Korean, Squire Strat. I have never seen another strat in this color..... I know for a FACT it is early 90's based off of the serial number. I have another Korean Strat I bought in 1993 and the serial numbers are 402 apart..... DETAILS: The bridge pick-up is an early 80's lace sensor prototype. I bought it off eBay and installed it. There is no brand on the pick up cover, but the last picture shows the label on the bottom of the pickup. I did the research and the early lace sensors didn't have a label on the cover. The color of the label on the bottom indicates the \"color\" of the model. It sounds FREEKING AMAZING!!!!!! Mid and Neck are unknown, but sound amazing as well...I didn't replace them!!!!! The tuners are upgraded FENDER super-strat tuners. Fret board was cleaned, lemon oil, frets polished and Elixer .009/.042's installed. You won't have to replace the strings for 6 months!!! The guitar has Dunlop strap loc buttons. I will include a set of silver strap receivers. Includes HSC as pictured. 8-ball sticker was installed in July, can be removed with no harm to finish. Unfortunately, I am thinning out my heard and I play primarily Les Paul's and I need a lefty 7-string. Don't miss your opportunity to own an affordable guitar, that is guaranteed to get the Jimi and Stevie sound you're looking for!!!!!", "ItemID": "192745715706", "EndTime": "2018-12-10T01:03:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T01:03:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Left-Handed-Fender-Squire-Stratocaster-/192745715706", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Berlin, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927457157068080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Xj8AAOSwosdcBHec/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PgMAAOSw~bhcBHep/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1mMAAOSwI7FcBHe2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/92QAAOSw-sVcBHfB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UREAAOSwTSlcBHfS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5DMAAOSwIw1cBHfm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9scAAOSwyPFcBHfu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IuAAAOSwihVcBHf2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/tXMAAOSw4c5cBHky/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15530", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "travihutzel_0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 125, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 210.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 210.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1185}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Left Handed Fender Squire Stratocaster", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 179, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 212.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
