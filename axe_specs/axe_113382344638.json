{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Item Description: Please note this guitar has the trademark logo instead of the registered mark on the head stock indicating this was an earlier production model. Guitar plays well has new strings was not set up will need proper setup (action seems a little high) but both pickup's work a little scratchy on the controls a quick spray of deoxit should clear it up. Neck has Finish cracks on headstock Maybe a little splitting? and a paint chip has come off but I will ship it with the paint chip to be glued back on or disposed of by the new owner. (See pic's) I removed tuners so you could see the full extent of the finish/wood splitting, does hold string tension fine . Other things to note is their is some very light corrosion on some of the hardware I have tried to show the worst of it.
