Here is a description from musicians friend.***The Fender Pawn Shop Jaguarillo Electric Guitar hot-rods traditional Jaguar design through the roof with a scorching HSS configuration in which all three pickups - two standard Stratocaster single-coils and an Atomic humbucking bridge pickup - are angled for enhanced bass and treble response. The Jaguar scale length permits the use of heavier gauge strings for a fuller sound while also still making string bends a breeze. Other unusual touches include a streamlined control layout (volume knob, tone knob and five-way blade pickup switch) and an Adjusto-Matic bridge with vintage-style floating tremolo tailpiece. This is no ordinary Jaguar.Pawn Shop Series guitars are inspired by the more eccentric Fender creations of the mid-\u212260s to mid-\u212270s, which sometimes found their way to the outside world and into the more esoteric pages of Fender history. Crafted for thoroughly modern sound and quality, they present a creative alchemy of diverse Fender elements. New for 2012, the Pawn Shop Series introduces an unconventional new assortment of \u0153guitars that never were but should have been.FeaturesComfortable Jaguar body made of alderC-shaped maple neck with 24\" scale lengthHSS pickup configuration angled for enhanced bassStreamline controls and Adjusto-Matic bridgeGig bag includedSpecificationsBody: AlderBody Shape: JaguarBody Finish: PolyesterNeck Shape: \"C\" ShapeNumber of Frets: 22Fret Size: Medium JumboFretboard Radius: 9.5\" (24.1cm)Fretboard: RosewoodNeck Material: MapleNeck Finish: UrethaneNut Width: 1.650 (42mm)Scale Length: 24\" (61cm)Pickup Configuration: H/S/SBridge Pickup: Atomic Humbucking PickupMiddle Pickup: Standard Single-Coil Strat Middle PickupNeck Pickup: Standard Single-Coil Strat Neck PickupPickup Switching: 5-Position Blade: Position 1.
