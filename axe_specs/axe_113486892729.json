{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a customized Jackson I bought from a pawn shop. In prep to sell it, I have learned it has been customized. I did not realize the value is much higher ! However I will keep the starting bid anyway cause I could use the cash. Please note: It is FULL scale, Not a short scale. Serious inquiries may contact me for more details. Will ship with neck off for better protection & lower shipping cost.On Dec-10-18 at 18:54:22 PST, seller added the following information: Hi, I wanted to be clear for people interest in the guitar. I've tried to enter more pics but the resolution is not clear & won't upload. The guitar is customized. It is NOT a dinky version, it is full scale 25.5 in. The neck is after market & very nice. Rosewood, Straight , & the Frets have no wear & are like new. Also it has Duncan Designed pickups, & it Rocks ! The machine heads are tight & smooth They are Jacksons, & I believe they are ball bearing, but don't know for sure, but it stay's in tune very well. If it helps, the neck has a serial # of, 11D572 ? the chrome neck back plate has \"Jackson\" engraved on it, & the serial # is 01060878 so I THINK it was made in 2001. But not sure ? I couldn't find one of all the Jacksons I've searched that looks like it to compare it with because it has been customized. It is like new & no scratches or dings. & lastly I must add that the master volume knob it is \"not\" hooked up. That is the way I got it & it is because the master volume is \" in the way\" for moderate or full strumming. It is taken off & true that it is in the way. So I left it that way. It is back on just for \"looks\" if you will, for selling. It is \"hotwired\" to full volume and was fine for me cause I mostly use headphones & it has volume control, foot peddles or the amp has volume control, so no big deal with the master volume knob not hooked up & I took it off myself to play it. It does work, & can be hooked back up easily if you wish, but if your a Strummer, you will probably take the knob off ? Thanks for looking & feel free to contact me with any more questions or I can try to send you more pics.
