{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "SALE PRICE & FREE USA SHIPPING Let's just say this guitar gives new meaning to the term \"player grade\". It's an original 1958 Danelectro 6-string U2 guitar that has been around the block a few (hundred) times. I bought it for the parts but after fixing a switch & ground I plugged it in and it sounded too good to tear apart. So this is what you get! The body looks like it was sanded harshly with an orbital sander and then painted with an off-white enamel. I think they were going for a Van Halen vibe but the concept obviously went astray. The body can easily be filled with body putty and lightly sanded for a finish to be applied. I was thinking a sparkle or hammertone but I didn't want to get too far into a restoration. Part it out or restore it, I'll leave that up to you. The pots date 3958 (39th week of 1958) if I remember correctly. Both pickups are strong and original as are the wiring and switches. The maple neck has a slab ebony(!) fretboard with well-worn original frets and serious grooving between the frets. I think this guitar was played 20 hours a day at one time. But it actually plays well and the neck is straight. The tuners and bridge are original. As I said there is no back plate but that's an easy circle cut out of plastic stock. No knobs but reissues and originals abound on ebay and don't cost a fortune. Includes a Fender gig bag FREE USA SHIPPING and a 30-day return privilege if you are not satisfied.", "ItemID": "223324259198", "EndTime": "2019-01-16T07:23:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T01:06:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/REAL-1958-DANELECTRO-U2-GUITAR-BEAT-BUT-ALL-ORIGINAL-PARTS-NEARLY-COMPLETE-/223324259198", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Scranton, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233242591988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQ2WDE2MDA=/z/7MUAAOSwl1FcO9mU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIzM1gxNjAw/z/0t8AAOSwJ3RcO9mY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~iYAAOSwLX5cO9mc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZtgAAOSw5EpcO9mf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODU4WDE1OTk=/z/jLYAAOSw87JcO9mh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3BQAAOSwj5BcO9mk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZfkAAOSwWrxcO9mo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTIxWDE2MDA=/z/MHMAAOSwj91cO9ms/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HfAAAOSwEfVcO9mv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTU2WDE2MDA=/z/nX4AAOSwTxhcO9my/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QLQAAOSwALlcO9m0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "18508", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bassrmh", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2087, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 349.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 349.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 862}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "REAL 1958 DANELECTRO U2 GUITAR, BEAT BUT ALL-ORIGINAL PARTS & NEARLY COMPLETE!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["U2 2-Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1958"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Off White"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut", "Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Danelectro"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Chambered"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Laminate", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 119, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1060888262", "StoreName": "bassrmh"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "missing the knobs & back plate", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
