{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1995 Fender Standard Stratocaster. Maple Fretboard. Made In Mexico. Mostly original. I got it used a few months back. I just bought another Strat last week so one has to go. The Guitar is 24 years old and in decent shape. The paint is what you'd expect for a 24 year old player. The paint around the lower horn is dull. Looks like the poly might have worn off around this area. Frets are very good. Electronics are in excellent working order, no scratchy pots or selector. I installed a Fender heavy block bridge to improve sustain and tone. I also added a Fender USA neck plate because it had an operational micro tilt on it. The Original Mexican neck plate doesn't have an adjustment hole in it. Original bridge and neck plate included. Rear tremolo cover is mint in color instead of the original white one. I have the original and will include it but it is cracked. Someone removed \"Squire Series\" from the headstock. Action is nice. Body appears to be alder. Guitar weighs in at 7.6 lbs. Will ship in a heavy gig bag. Thanks for looking. :)", "ItemID": "223310995212", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T17:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T17:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1995-Fender-Standard-Stratocaster-Black-Label-Squire-Series-Made-Mexico-/223310995212", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hanover, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233109952128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BncAAOSwiwZcLubC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bxUAAOSwUMBcLubE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~HcAAOSwmfhcLubG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PEgAAOSw5qJcLubI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NAUAAOSw-yJcLubK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H-MAAOSwZ2tcLuc3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/O1gAAOSwEONcLuc4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JXkAAOSwt~1cLuc6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pBAAAOSwIbtcLuc8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6R0AAOSw8PJcLuc9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MtwAAOSwz3FcLuc~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HIoAAOSwfhlcL~a7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "17331", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "scmoore_72", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 90, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1995 Fender Standard Stratocaster \"Black Label\" \"Squire Series\" Made In Mexico", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Made in Mexico Squire Series"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1995"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Tremelo Bar"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 177, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 203.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["AF", "AM", "AZ", "BD", "BT", "CN", "GE", "IN", "JP", "KZ", "KR", "KG", "MV", "MN", "NP", "PK", "LK", "TJ", "TM", "UZ"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
