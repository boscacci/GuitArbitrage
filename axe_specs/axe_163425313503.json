{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 1999 Fender Telecaster '72 vintage reissue in near mint condition and in perfect working order. This \"Crafted in Japan\" Telecaster is a rare model, meant only for the Japanese domestic market, and features a sleek black finish with chrome hardware and a black pickguard. Officially model TL72, this guitar comes with a pair of stock Fender Telecaster single coils that have plenty of sparkle and twang. The tonal palette offers a bridge pickup that has ample twang and chime. The neck pickup is plenty warm, yet still articulate, with bell-like top end and a smooth response. The guitar weighs in at 7lbs 10oz and has a crisp, clear acoustic voice. Professionally setup here at Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar, this Tele is strung with 10-46 strings and has low, slinky action.The one-piece maple neck has a medium C shaped profile on the chunky side of things, with good shoulder and a bit more heft as you travel up the fretboard. The slab rosewood fretboard boasts Fender's traditional 7 1/4\" fretboard radius, with a nut that is notably wider than 1 5/8\" but still a hair narrower than 1 11/16\". The vintage-style fretwire is flawless with perfect crowns, playing cleanly up the neck. On the headstock, the Gotoh tuning machines turn smoothly and hold pitch well.All of the stock electronics work as they should, with chrome hardware that is essentially mint and aluminum barrel saddles. Above the Fender \"F\" embossed neck plate, the \"Crafted in Japan\" text and \"P\" prefix serial number are present. Cosmetically, this guitar is as clean as they come, with only a few minor scuffs and dings, almost exclusively on the back.The original Fender gigbag and hangtags are included.
