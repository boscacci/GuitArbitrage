{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a beautiful used Epiphone '56 Gold Top Les Paul that plays well and is in stunning condition! The guitar is used so please view all photos very closely for any imperfections and note that the guitar is sold AS IS. I tried to capture any imperfections as well as I could so again, please examine the photos closely prior to bidding. All electronics work and it sounds amazing! It's being sold because it's one of many other guitars that were inherited and are being cleared out for an upcoming move. According to the serial number, the guitar was manufactured in Korea in 2004 and has for the past years been sitting in a case in an air conditioned bedroom. NO CASE is included with this sale. The volume knobs were changed to better match the paint color but it's otherwise completely original. Please contact me with any questions and I'll do my best to answer them as well as I can, but bear in mind that I'm only a casual guitar player so might not be able to help you with detailed specifics.
