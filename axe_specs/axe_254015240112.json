Please look at photos..If you have any questions, please message me BEFORE you bid. OVERVIEW The first affordable Xiphos model with a bolt-on neck and double-locking tremolo. The Ibanez XP300 Xiphos Electric Guitar has a double-cutaway mahogany body for warm, dark tone. The guitar's 3-piece maple neck sports a Wizard II profile for fast and effortless shredding. Its bound rosewood fretboard is fitted with 24 jumbo frets. The Xiphos' low-profile Edge III double-locking bridge stands up to serious abuse without losing pitch. Ibanez Infinity pickups offer more bite and chunk with balanced string output. A 5-way switch delivers wide tonal variety. Aesthetic touches include a reversed headstock, deeply beveled edges, dot fingerboard inlays, black hardware, and an awesome iron pewter finish. Infinity humbucking pickups The humbucking ceramic Infinity 3 neck pickup provides dynamic sound for chording and rhythm. The humbucking Infinity 4 pickup in the bridge position is equipped with an alnico magnet and has a brilliant tone for lead work that is warm and generates good harmonics. Edge III tremolo system The Edge III tremolo on the Ibanez Xiphos XP300 has lower profile tuners for better palm comfort. It provides strength and extraordinary tuning stability even under the most demanding playing conditions. The double-locking Edge III bridge allows for the most radical tremolo effects ever, as well as for total tuning stability. Case sold separately.
