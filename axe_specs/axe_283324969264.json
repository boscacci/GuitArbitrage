{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2017 Gibson Traditional HP in absolutely mint condition. Looks to be barely touched at all. You cannot go wrong with this purchase. Lovely flame, not captured very well in the pictures, it is much more beautiful in person. Shipping is free, and probably is extremely expensive since the case alone weighs 30-35 lbs. The guitar weighs 9.0 lbs. So all total the weight is roughly 40 lbs... Case is unreal, you could probably run over it with a truck and not damage the guitar.
