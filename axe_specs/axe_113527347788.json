CTC started making TimeWarp guitars and parts for the player who wanted a vintage Fender instrument, not a licensed parts guitar that looked like a Fender and didn't want to drop 5k. They are amazing looking and sounding guitars that give you everything you want in a vintage guitar but the price.This TW56 started life as a 2010 factory Fender Road Worn 50s Tele, and was transformed into an authentic looking and playing Custom Shop quality 1956 Vintage White Nitro Nashville Telecaster through the TimeWarp process of aging and relic work. It is incredibly realistic in its look, and the tone is pure Fender thanks to the Fender Texas Specials, creating a vintage/modern blues machine. This Fender guitar would cost $3,500 or more if it came out of the Custom Shop, but not at Crosstown Customs. The work that went into it takes this guitar to a whole new level. The amount of checking and player wear makes it look truly authentic and is usually found only on a real 1950s model, or Masterbuilt guitars. The Vintage White Nitro was shot over the factory Nitro 2 tone Sunburst, and is thin so the wood to resonate, just like Leo wanted. It will continue to age like a vintage instrument.The neck was made to look a true work horse, and the original decal was aged to look like it is above the finish, just like the original. Part of the TimeWarp process is to remove the serial number and stamp it into the heel of the neck, which adds to the aura and keeps the important serial number with your guitar. A random 1956 serial number is stamped into the neck plate.The pickups are created for maximum blues and rock potential, with keeping the Tele twang in the mix. The push-pull pot activates the bridge and neck together for a nice, nasal twang. The bridge pickup is a USA Fender Texas Special from an Amercan Special, and is wound hotter than the Custom Shop version, coming in just over 10k. The RWRP middle and neck are Relic Fender Texas Special's.It has a great setup, and plays easily. It comes complete with a real world black Road Runner tolex case.While it's a relic, the guitar was created to look this way and there are no issues. It's better than the day it left the Fender factory. It looks, sounds and plays better and you get all the vintage guitar you want without the vintage price tag. here's a link to the original ad where i bought the guitar from:https://reverb.com/item/12038625-relic-timewarp-nashville-56-fender-50s-52-reissue-telecaster-texas-specials Model: TimeWarp 56 (TW56) SN: MX10184998 Weight: 7 lbs, 5 oz Neck Profile: Full C Frets: Medium Jumbo Nut: 1.650", "ItemID": "113527347788", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T18:59:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T04:29:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Road-Worn-50s-Telecaster-Electric-Guitar-/113527347788", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fresno, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135273477888080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zYAAAOSwA3xcMYL3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vegAAOSwK9ZcMYL~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/B2MAAOSwALpcMYL6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2PMAAOSwW7NcMYMH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/64oAAOSwnfRcMYL9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IG8AAOSwa~FcMYMC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3GQAAOSwrfRcMYME/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/micAAOSwGIZcMYMG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "93705", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ramonsgoldandsilver", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 491, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 138}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Road Worn 50s Telecaster Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Ash"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["131212303"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Road Worn"]}]}, "HitCount": 511, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78587794", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
