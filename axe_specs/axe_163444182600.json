{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I sell my guitar Cort VX-4V. Bought it for $700 in 2010. The guitar looks and sounds gorgeous) I sell because I need money, I would never part with it otherwise. Together with the guitar I give original factory case, of good quality, which perfectly protects the guitar in trips. I give as a gift case from a bass guitar bought for $100 in 2012 (it doesn\u2019t fit into the covers of regular guitars). The cover is of excellent quality - there are several very convenient pockets, it is possible to carry a guitar as a backpack behind your back or on the side of the handle as a case. Minus of the guitar - there is a damaged varnish on the bottom end (I don\u2019t remember how it appeared there), you can just paint it by black lacquer. This does not affect the sound. Here are links to some YouTube videos for this guitar (Unfortunately, most in poor quality.):in this color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=538osouMO2Yin other colors:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkMDavgcuzchttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnvSXeLlMcwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNEB5er5KPEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVqkXxUAe8ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_jAXg1KT2s Attention! The strings have not changed for about 2 years and are already worn out well, so after buying a guitar it is better to change them for others at your own discretion. Thank you for watching! Ask your questions, I will answer them with pleasure.", "ItemID": "163444182600", "EndTime": "2018-12-28T13:20:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T13:20:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Cort-Electric-Guitar-VX-4V-Black-Cherry-Sunburst-BCS-/163444182600", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Odessa, Odeskiy", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634441826008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDkwMA==/z/MDAAAOSw-pNb0xgP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODI1WDEyODA=/z/mZ4AAOSwMjpb0wZN/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/OaEAAOSw96Zb0wZY/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/c6kAAOSwqS5b0wZa/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDYwMA==/z/MtEAAOSwEGpb0xgQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/QhEAAOSwds9b0wZi/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/sUoAAOSwNp1b0wZo/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/UGMAAOSwr5db0wZs/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/XF4AAOSwE9Bb0wZ-/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njc5WDEyODA=/z/8owAAOSwD~Fb0waU/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "andmosh-14", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 228.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 228.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 4}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": " Cort Electric Guitar VX-4V Black Cherry Sunburst (BCS)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Redwood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Cort"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["VX-4V"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 97, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "UA", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalRefund": "MoneyBack", "InternationalReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsAccepted", "InternationalShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 230.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
