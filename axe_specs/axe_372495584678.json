{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2013 Fender Eric Clapton Signature StratocasterHere is a genuine American made Fender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster. The serial number starts with \"US13\", which dates it to 2013. It has the original black finish on an alder body. The neck is has the Soft V shape, 9.5\" radius and 1.65\" nut width. It has Noiseless pickups and the TBX Control on one tone knob and Active Mid Boost (0-25dB). Mid boost kit on the other. Actual weight is 7 lbs 14 oz.The body is in very good condition overall with no major dings. There are a few impressions and some streaks visible in the light (mostly above the pickguard), but nothing out of the ordinary for a used guitar. There are no cracks or structural issues. The original pickguard had some discoloration from a sticker, so I installed a new Fender '57 Reissue single ply pickguard. The strap buttons have also been upgraded.The neck is straight and the frets show only light wear. It's in excellent playing condition with no dead frets or other major issues. The fretboard, back of the neck and headstock are clean with no dings or worn areas. No cracks, repairs or extra holes.The hardware and electronics are original and in excellent working condition. It comes with a Fender tweed case which has some light wear on the outside. All of the latches, hinges and handle are in excellent working order and the interior has no bad odors.This guitar is listed on Reverb also. In the event that it sells on both marketplaces, I will honor the first sale and refund the second. There will be no exceptions to this!Please note that I do not set up my guitars before mailing. I have played it and everything is great as far as I'm concerned, but you may need to change the strings, adjust the action or do other maintenece to get it to your preferences.
