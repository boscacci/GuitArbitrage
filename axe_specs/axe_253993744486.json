{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for your consideration is a nice 2006-2008 Crafted in Japan Fender Stratocaster. Pics were taken outside so there is a glare. The color is close to candy apple red, maybe a little darker. It looks darker like a maroon in low lighting. I tried to take pics to show the difference. There is a slight blemish in the paint on the back, but it\u2019s not noticeable unless you really look for it. I got this guitar a while back but don\u2019t have much time to play anymore so I\u2019m letting it go. Pickups have been upgraded to a Seymour Duncan hotrail at the bridge, Dimarzio pro track(vintage PAF) in the middle, and a Seymour Duncan cool rail at the neck. Guitar sounds great and plays great. I was told the pots, switch, input jack, and bridge are all fender USA American. It has Grover locking tuners, and comes with a nice tweed hardshell case. Missing the back plate. This is one sweet guitar and I\u2019ll probably regret getting rid of it. I will probably ship via USPS priority mail. PayPal is the payment method. And I\u2019ll only ship to the lower 48 states. Please contact with any questions prior to purchase. This guitar is for sale locally as well, so I reserve the right to cancel the auction at anytime.
