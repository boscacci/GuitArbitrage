{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a used 2011 Godin LGX-SA AAA Flamed Maple Cognac Burst Electric Guitar in excellent condition.The guitar has 3 voices: electric, acoustic, and 13 pin synth access. Bought this in 2012 and it immediately became my main guitar. Played this every weekend in church for about 2 years. I\u2019ve used it with a Roland GR-33 and also run 2 cables from the acoustic jack and electric jack at the same time. Probably the most versatile guitar I\u2019ve ever owned, seen, or heard. I\u2019ve been hanging onto this beauty for awhile, but with a change in location and instrumentation needs, she just isn\u2019t seeing the same amount of action anymore. I still own 2 other Godin electric guitars and I truly believe they are the best \u201cunknown guitar\u201d out there. This beast has a mahogany body with a AAA-grade figured maple top. The mahogany neck has an ebony finger board that significantly improves synth tracking as compared to a rosewood fretboard. The custom RMC system provides acoustic guitar sounds from a bridge transducer,while Seymour Duncan custom humbuckers drive the electric tone. Synth access comes courtesy of the 13-pin connector for direct control of Roland GR Series and Axon AX100 guitar synths. Acoustic and electric outputs can be used alone or in tandem to further expand the tonal textures and flexibility.

Never transported very far and I haven\u2019t found a nick or scratch on her anywhere though I\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably a small ding here or there. There is some typical fret wear and some minor pitting on the pickup covers. Here\u2019s a link to the pdf file from the Godin site with all the info you could ever want. I\u2019ve put a printed one in the case.http://godinguitars.com/lgxsa.pdf Shipping is a flat $60 via UPS or USPS ground to anywhere in the lower 48 states unless extra shipping charges are paid.
