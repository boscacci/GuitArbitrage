I've used it primarily for recording and a few jams. It's never been on the road and is in excellent condition. This is one of the best feeling and sounding G&Ls I've ever played. It resonates and sings beautifully, and the neck is like butter.I upgraded the stock bridge pickup with a Fender USA '62 Custom Telecaster Bridge Pickup. It sounds amazing and is a great complement to the Seymore Duncan Seth Lover alnico humbucker in the neck spot - which also sounds absolutely incredible. I actually bought this guitar specifically for this configuration and that Seth Lover humbucker. This pickup combo is so sweet. You can go from a gritty Eric Clapton Beano vibe to a fat round blues snarl, then back off the gain and get into deliciously smooth jazz tones. It's insane how much range this guitar has. I've had it set up for precision lead action, but I've always thought it would make a killer slide guitar as well. Side note - If you want to put the original G&L MFD bridge pickup back in, it is included. In my opinion it doesn't hold a candle to that 62, but some folks are really into the G&L pups so it's there if you want it.The clear blond body color with the tortoise shell pickguard turns out to be fairly unusual. I shopped for a long time for a white tele style when I found this, and as I was researching for this sale I found that there really aren't many with this combo around. The body and neck are in awesome condition, no fret-wear or \"bend trenches\" between frets. The action is set up for a standard set of 10s.The only cosmetic blemish I can find on the whole guitar is a tiny ding on the edge of the fingerboard (see photos). It doesn't affect play or tone at all, and I didn't even know it was there until going over it for sale. The case has a couple of nicks on the outside but is otherwise in excellent condition. Shipping I have shipped many guitars and I know how to pack it tight and right. In the unlikely event that it falls off the truck and tumbles end over end into the sea, I insure the shipment for the full price of the guitar and require a signature for delivery.This is a great opportunity to pick up a fantastic guitar, with a truly bitchen pickup combination and an unusual body color for WAY below market price. ...you might not want to wait too long because if I can raise the cash for my classes before it gets sold, I will yank this ad faster than a sneeze through a screen door.
