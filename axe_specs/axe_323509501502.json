{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a 2007 Ibanez 20th Anniversary RG550MXX in Road Flare Red (the rarest color) with original 1989 Ibanez RG550 pick ups installed and it's original hard shell case. I purchased this guitar as my shred guitar due to it having the exact dimensions of the original 1980's Wizard Neck as opposed to the current 2018 30th Anniversary RG550 reissues which do not. After a while I've come to terms that my hands are just too slow to shred, so here it is up for sale to fund a different guitar. The guitar came from the last owner with Dimarzio pickups installed that I replaced with original RG550 pick ups pulled from a 1989 RG550. He also had it wired to allow the tone knob to kill the volume when rolled down completely; a great feature as if you miss the volume knob and roll off the tone instead it will still kill the sound. I also fixed small things like installing brand new volume and tone knobs as well as replacing the bushings on the trem arm for a snug fit. Like any good quality decade old guitar, it has been played and taken care of but does show all the classic wear of a player's guitar.
