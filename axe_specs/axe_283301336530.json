We carry products from some of the most respected manufacturers in the music industry including Fender, Vox, Dream Cymbals, Roland, Yamaha, Blackstar, Behringer, Takamine, ESP, Schecter, Shure, ADJ, Wampler, TC Electronic and more. Up for sale is a PRS S2 Single cut guitar w/PRS gig bag. Formerly owned by one of our teachers, this guitar plays and sounds great and weighs in at 7.9 lbs. It has some roughness to the finish that can be seen in the photos. Fretwear is visible, but action and intonation are excellent. With an understated, refined appearance, instant comfort and playability, and a voice that is familiar and captivating, the vintage-inspired S2 Singlecut is a guitar you won\u2019t want to put down. Its mahogany body and asymmetrical, beveled maple top give the S2 Singlecut much of its explosive tone. And while not a super high output guitar, the S2 Singlecut can be overdriven into well-rounded, organic rock tones without sacrificing the punch or clarity found in higher-output guitars (or even active pickups). The bridge pickup is rich with some sparkle and substantial but tight low end, while the neck pickup is a little darker providing great balance and vintage tones.
