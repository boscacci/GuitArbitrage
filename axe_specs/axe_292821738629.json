{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I have too many guitars, so I am selling a few. This is a Gibson Les Paul Studio that I bought from a friend of mine a few years ago. After buying the guitar, I had my local guitar shop do a professional setup, cleaning, and re-stringing of the guitar. My buddy, who I bought it from - he gigged with it regularly during high school, so there are a few dings on the bottom pickup (see photos - it still works fine) and the paint is a little worn here and there, particularly on the neck from where he placed his hand when he played (again, see the photos). As best as I can tell, the serial number is 03201393 (see photos - back of the headstock), which means the guitar was manufactured in the Nashville, TN plant on November 16, 2001. The case has a few dings, but is still in decent shape. The lock on the case will snap shut and open, but it won't \"lock\" using the combination. It basically functions just like the other snap locks on the case. I will probably ship the guitar USPS, UPS, or FedEx ground service unless you request otherwise. I am just going to ship the guitar in the case without a box around the case. I've bought numerous guitars offline, and this has always worked fine when I get guitars shipped to me (it is a hardshell case, after all). However, I'll probably put a little bubble wrap in the case to further shield the guitar from getting banged around too much in the shipping process in case the delivery man handles it rough. Shipping usually runs anywhere from $85 to $150. I'm just going to charge $100 and if it is more, I'll pay the rest out of the sales price. I've had it a few years, but I don't really play it much. It works fine, but I just have other Les Pauls that i play more often. So, maybe I'm letting it go. Happy bidding! (Note: I just noticed that I have my strap-locks on the guitar in the photos. I keep those and put the regular strap that were on it when I got it, back on it. I just wanted to let potential buyers know. However, I might just leave those on there. I'll decide before I ship. The polishing cloth and strap stay with the guitar.)", "ItemID": "292821738629", "EndTime": "2018-11-27T23:07:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-17T23:07:21.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-/292821738629", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pineville, Louisiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928217386298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/V2oAAOSwlelb8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MTY=/z/32MAAOSwoZJb8JUa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjQ=/z/GacAAOSwTxhb8JUa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MTE=/z/zlIAAOSwVXdb8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MDY=/z/J2YAAOSwt0db8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MkgAAOSwwqVb8JUc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-nMAAOSwnh5b8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vZQAAOSwYh5b8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE0WDE1OTk=/z/bXgAAOSwqKNb8JUc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M9oAAOSwarlb8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Vs8AAOSwPTlb8JUc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/N0EAAOSwzhZb8JUd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "71360", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "starbuck2907", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 80, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 224}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Studio", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silver"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 440, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
