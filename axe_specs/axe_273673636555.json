{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful near mint condition 2014 Crimson Red Transparent American Standard Telecaster. I say near mint because I can find no issues whatsoever, No dings, scratches, etc. This is an awesome guitar. It features the Custom Shop Twisted Tele Pickup in the neck position and the Broadcaster Pickup in the bridge position. These are awesome pickups, clear and powerful. They remind me of the Joe Barden pickups made famous by the late guitar great, Danny Gatton. The neck has the rolled fingerboard edges which give a great feel and just make this guitar so easy to play. The contoured back is so very comfortable. The Transparent Crimson Red finish really highlights the natural beauty of the wood grain. I made the following changes/upgrades. I replaced the original bridge with the Joe Barden compensated saddle bridge for a more vintage look (my preference). This guitar produces unbelievable resonance and sustain. I have and will include the original bridge and screws in case the buyer wants to swap it back. I also replaced the black pickguard with a white fender pearloid one simply because I like the look. Again I have the original still coated with the plastic and Custom Shop Pickup sticker that came on the guitar. Included are all the wrenches, guitar cord, polish cloth, hang tags, etc. The black fender hardshell case is also like new, in my opinion. Handle still wrapped. 1 of the latches is a little sluggish and requires a little manual help to close. Comes with the key. Whoever ends up with guitar will not be disappointed. I have sold and bought quite a few used guitars over the years and I have to say this is in the best condition of any used guitar I have seen. Also, I will ship for free.
