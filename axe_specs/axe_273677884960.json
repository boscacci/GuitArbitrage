{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello. Here is a 2003 Paul Reed Smith Custom 22 with Birds. Special Factory order 3 way switch for coil splitting. Beautiful Tortoise shell color on a Flamed maple top. Nice weight under 8 pounds. Very resonant guitar here,and has a great vibe when strumming unamplified. You can feel the vibe in your hands, and on your body.She Plays Phenomenal, and has the Dragon II pick ups via the special order circuit which splits the humbucker/s giving you 6 excellent tones. A Wide Fat neck, and beautifully grained rosewood board with gorgeous abalone Bird inlays. The frets are in excellent condition. No fret wear. No ruts, or grooves from string wear. The Guitar has seen some love, and has some handling wear on the guitar. Most notable on the bottom side edge(pic.#12)( Down to the wood about the size of a vitamin E capsule) It has been smoothed out, and looks natural. A few insignificant marks on the headstock horn tips too. There is some oxidation on the pick up covers. No breaks, no repairs, and absolutely No playing issues whatsoever. She is in a very good Players Grade category, and will fill the bill for sure. the pics. were taken outdoors, and indoors with an LG 30 Smart phone(different color tones). Not the best camera for good clarity/ The Dragon II pick ups will give you a hotter PAF tone, and with the tone control rolled off a little does the Les Paul tone very well. The Bridge pick up is powerful bold, and sounds killer ( especially running through my Mesa Boogie F 50 head Mesa Rectifier 4 x 12 Cabinet. Excellent sustain, and has a sweet bloom. With the coils split, it really does add a great cleaner more vintage, lower output tone that will add new dimension, and inspiration to your playing. The Paul Reed Smith has the original hard shell case too with all the paper work, and the original specification Bird Tag/Card. You want a cool Paul Reed Smith Custom 22 that plays beautifully, and has Great tone? Here it is. You will love this Guitar, and I will insure it for the full price when shipping to you. Thanks, and have Fun.", "ItemID": "273677884960", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T01:37:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T23:59:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-Custom-22-Flamed-Top-Birds-WF-Dragon-II-OHSC-/273677884960", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bethpage, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736778849608080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxMlgxNjAw/z/AJoAAOSwRGRcUOfk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bbsAAOSwltxcUOgw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODM2WDEzODY=/z/Nu4AAOSwUHBcUObQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g3UAAOSw6JhcUOcE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hlIAAOSwfMlcUOcj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J8QAAOSwaPNcUObt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1QUAAOSwhY9cUOgI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t8sAAOSwo1lcUOc5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9gEAAOSw-uZcUOdG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cdYAAOSwUMBcUOeF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0f0AAOSwZNtcUOe-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CHwAAOSwqLlcUOf9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11714", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "1helluvaguy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1643, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1465.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1465.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 654}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith Custom 22 Flamed Top, Birds, WF, Dragon II, OHSC", "HitCount": 165, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=123810788", "StoreName": "1helluvaguy"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
