{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Priced to sell quickly - I no longer need to cover keyboards in the band.In very good condition - shows some sign of use. I had the electronics for the synth out replaced to fix an issue with output to the guitar synth.Odds are if you are looking at this you know this guitar. If not, check out a demo on YouTube (not the actual guitar, but looks and sounds like this one. UPDATE: added picture of parts replaced during repair. Also added pic of guitar with white paper - this is the darker model (Cedar Top?). Also added pic of frets - this guitar was always my backup to the Roland Ready Strat, so lightly used. OK - after more research, this is a 2002 model, not the dark Cognac model, but the spruce. Sorry for the confusion. Manufacturer Description:This is one model that transcends both the Multiac andSignature series of Godin guitars. At first glance the Jazz has a familiar lookwith its single cutaway chambered body adorned with traditional F-holes and theGodin GJN1 humbucker at the top of the fingerboard. However the slottedheadstock and the preamp controls on the upper bout may be the first cluestowards discovering that this isn't your average jazz guitar. The standard Jazzcomes with a triple-A-grade flame maple top.Although capable of producing classic jazz guitar soundscourtesy of the Godin GJN1 humbucking pickup, the Jazz has the power to takeyou far beyond traditional jazz guitar sounds. Each saddle in the bridge isactually an independent transducer, which is supported by an on-board preampand graphic EQ. Designed specifically for the Jazz, this system opens up aworld of new sonic possibilities for all players. The crystalline soundsproduced by this system can be used on their own, or very effectively incombination with the neck position pickup. A small dose of the bridge outputcan be combined with the mellow sound of the GJN1 to produce added notedefinition so often missing in traditional archtop guitar sounds. The MultiacJazz also includes hexaphonic output from a 13-pin connector, which providesdirect access to Roland GR-Series synthesizers, and the various V-Guitarproducts that Roland has developed around the same 13-pin interface.
