{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This G&L Bluesboy guitar plays WAY better than the stock condition! I bought from Musicians Friend less than a year ago and I was initially not too happy with the setup and the tuners. I had it set up by a guitar tech and he upgraded the tuners to some Fender tuners and it stays in tune very well now! The set up is excellent, and it sounds great and feels great in your hands! I spent an extra $160 with the tuners and the set up but it made a BIG difference in how this guitar plays! Does not come with case. You'll love this guitar. Great value!
