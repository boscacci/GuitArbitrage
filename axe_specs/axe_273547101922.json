{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This listing is for a killer sounding vintage 1960s Danelectro model 6026 DC-2 Electric Guitar. This guitar was made in the USA by Danelectro in circa 1960. This is a nicer version on the DC-2 model electric guitar and has a very cool white finish and formica pickguard. The guitar has been professionally set up and plays great. The neck is straight and the action is low and comfortable. The guitar is all original with the exception of one of the on/off flipper knobs. The pots date to 1960. The guitar shows cosmetic wear and has splotchy marks on the top and sides along with more typical wear including nicks, dings and scratches. Please look at the pictures and email with questions. The guitar comes with the original case pictured which is a very cool rare original case but the case is in rather rough shape as you can see from the pics. The guitar will be expertly packed for safe shipping.
