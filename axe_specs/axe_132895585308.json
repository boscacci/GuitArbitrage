Has some light swirl marks on the back and some light pick/play wear near the pickups. There's also some minor scuff marks on the bridge. Guitar has been stamped \"Used\" on the back of the headstock by Epiphone from the factory due to a finish flaw where the neck meets the body. The thin strip was left unstained and clear coated over at the factory. See pics for more info. Isn't noticeable until you go looking for it. Other than that, the bass is in great condition. Still has the factory plastic on the control plate and back of the tuners. Electronics tested and working. Neck is good and straight. Frets are in excellent condition. Great player!!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
