Model H-15, Bobkat, Silhouette series. It is 100% original and complete. It has some wear... scuffs, scratches, bumps, dings and spots around the body edge that has rubbed finish off. This guitar is in exceptional playing condition, especially when you consider it is over 50 years old. It comes with the original (rough, missing stitches) chipboard case you see in the pictures. Features include: Chrome hardware, open back tuners, 20 fret neck, 24 inch scale, rosewood fingerboard w/ pearly dot markers, two single coil pickups, 2 volume controls, 2 tone controls, rosewood bridge, single ply pickguard, sunburst finish. The frets and finger board look new. Neck is straight. Original Rowe Industries, DeArmond gold foil pickups and wiring harness. The pickups are strong, sound awesome and work great. All the electronics work, no scratchy pots. I have completely serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the body and neck, cleaned the controls, oiled the tuners, cleaned and conditioned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the frets, installed new Dean Markley cryogenic activated Blue Steel 10-52 strings, adjusted the bridge, etc. It plays great, DON'T MISS IT!!
