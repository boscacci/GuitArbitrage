{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a pretty nice left-handed Fender Stratocaster, made in Japan (J serial number was used 1989-90 and I didn't pull out the neck to see what date is there). Some fret wear but no buzzing (the B string nut slot was low and that has been filled, so it's functioning properly now), and quite a bit of scratching on the pickguard although guard is not chipped. Some scratches from use on the body but I don't see any chips. Switch tip has some black paint on it. The \"Made in Japan\" has been removed from the back of the neck where neck joins the body. I don't have the lefty tremelo arm, but I did check with another arm to make sure that it is not stripped where the arm would go in. It has the stock bridge with \"Fender Fender\" saddle stamping. Neck is straight. Electronics working properly, and those are original with the long magnet on the bottom of the bobbins. The trem cover on the back is a right-handed one which was reversed to work with the existing holes (no extra holes drilled). Generic gig bag included which is for a right-handed guitar but it does work. Shipping will be $35 in the CONUS; elsewhere contact for a quote. Thanks! I will take pictures of the guitar when it is boxed. 3 witnesses will be with me to package, box and ship the guitar. This is to protect from any type of scammer claiming an empty box or a wrong item. The witnesses will be willing to testify in court. NO REFUNDS, no PARTIAL REFUNDS. If you but it, you must pay within 36hrs. Overall the guitar plays great, looks killer and YES I will forever regret selling it. I MUST MOVE ON! Buy with condifence.
