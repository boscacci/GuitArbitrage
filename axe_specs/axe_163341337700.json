{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This listing is for a nice 1987/88 Fender (Made in Japan) Stratocaster made in the Fuji Gen Gakki factory (before being sent over to Tokai). The guitar has seen some use and it has a fair share of dings and mishaps, but overall is still a great playing and sounding guitar. Has that natural \"relic\" look that is very popular nowadays (and it was done naturally over time)! It is missing the plastic back cavity cover but it does have the original tremolo bar, straplocks, strap, and case (case has a bad latch).
