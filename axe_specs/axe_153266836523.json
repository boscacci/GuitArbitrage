{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your consideration is an Ibanez AS7312 12 string semi-hollow electric guitar. This has seen very little playing time and has only been out of the house for pictures. It does have fine scratches throughout from playing and handling, but there are no major scratches and no dents or dings at all. I took the photos outside to try to show the scratches since they do not show up on inside photos, but the bright sunlight almost exaggerates them. The worst is on the right (facing the guitar) cut out just above the pickguard as is shown in the close up picture. In person it is not that noticeable. This model did not come with a pickguard so I added one. It was for an Epiphone Dot and I had to open up the spacing for the pickups. It was recently added so it looks brand new. That's the only change made to this guitar. The only other flaw is the very bottom knob has a discolored spot in it from about the numbers 4 to 6 which you can see in the photo. With little use, there is very minimal fret wear. It plays well but doesn't get much use so I am selling it to make room for another guitar in the future. The cherry color is not as bright as shown in the outdoor photos so I included one taken indoors. While cIoser to the actual color, it appears kind of dark. There's lots of photos on the internet of AS73's so you can check out the color there. It's pretty standard. I try to describe everything as accurately as possible so please check out my 100% feedback rating. I hate being disappointed by bad surprises so I describe my items as detailed as possible. The only shipping option I have in my town is the USPS. I am estimating the shipping cost based on past experience with other guitars I have sold. If I am high with my estimate, I will REFUND the excess shipping amount rounded up to the next dollar. I hate overpaying for shipping! I ship Ground transportation, but occasionally depending upon the buyers location I can upgrade to Priority Mail for the same cost. I also pay for insurance out of my pocket to make sure the we are both protected if something should happen during shipping. Sorry, no case or gig bag is included, but the guitar will be securely packaged in a guitar carton, bubble wrapped and with an extra layer of cardboard inside. I have shipped quite a few guitars as I rotate some through my collection, and I have never had any damaged in shipping. I will ship within 2 business days of receiving payment and only to the continental US.
