{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this First Act Special Edition CE240 Sheena. Don't be fooled by the name, this guitar is great. For a short time, First Act sold these mid-level/working pro guitars as well as premium custom-made guitars, but due to unfavorable press and public opinion, because of their low-end beginner instruments, that side of their business quickly folded. It features a string-through-body design, patented First Act String Retainer system and a low profile Tune-O-Matic bridge, for maximum sustain and tonal reproduction. You can get a wide range of tones from Fender Telecaster to Gibson Les Paul and SG. This guitar is extremely well made and plays like any low end American or higher end Mexican made guitar from Fender, Gretsch, Gibson or the like. Id take this over a used mexican Fender and its defiantly nicer then the Epiphone SG and Les Pauls. The maple fretboard isn't finished so it gets dirty fast, however I just wipe it down between string changes. This guitar is VERY clean and well kept, its a little dusty from sitting but is dent/chip free with the only damage shown the best I could show is on the back of the guitar, there is a scratch and light scuffing which is very hard to show in the pictures. It has been given a pro setup and comes with a Gig bag which is a very nice quality gig bag. Its had a pro setup with 10's put on it and is properly intonated. These are becoming quite collectable and are getting harder and harder to find, I set it to my lowest price I will accept for it and will not be going any lower than that, so if you would like it go for it and thanks for looking!
