This cool short scale guitar is in fantastic shape. Very few dings and such.....see pics...That pickup is a killer\u2026single coil Valco made Supro pickup..They called it a Bell Tone...very descriptive...it really sings! if you haven\u2019t heard one of these..expect to be impressed\u2026the dating label on the back of the headstock dates it 1964 to 1968. They only made this model two years..1964 and 1965...Its one of those years... It is Very Light!! Only weighs 5 lbs ...It has a 22 inch short scale neck which makes it super easy to play....Very unique!! ... This Supro USA Made Oahu guitar has the original Neck, body, Pickup, Kluson Tuners, Bridge and tailpiece. . All ORIGINAL !!! There was one broken tip on the pickguard which we rerouted. See pic 4. This beauty is all original including the Double Line Kluson Tuners and foil serial number sticker on the back of the headstock... It appears that the tone pot was replace some time ago..it looks older but not original...see pics... Ever hear these Supro Pickups??...You are in for a treat...Very Hot and bright which made them very nice for early 60's Rock, but crank it up and it is a Blues Monster that cannot be ignored on stage...yes, its that good!!...The neck action is as good as it gets.. Our Techs did a great job setting this guitar up...it has easy playing low low action...It is a pleasure to play........ Now this guitar is very nice but given its age it is sold as-is and is not returnable, however, I have been hand picking my customers guitars for close to 20 years now and they have all loved the guitars I find...This one will be no exception...
