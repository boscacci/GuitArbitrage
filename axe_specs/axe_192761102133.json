The neck profile is fast playing this guitar feels solid and unlike super heavy les pauls can keep on your lap for longer periods of time or easier on shoulder when standing. Sound: the Dimarzio 59 pickups and natural resonance of guitar sounds great clean or with distortion. Note: the selector switch is set to be up for bridge and down for neck for personal preference. That can be turned around and retightened by removing pickguard. No visible marks on body. Fully functional. the original les paul special custom was 1k and not good looking. This guitar now looks amazing and sounds alot better with dimarzio pickups. Does not have case.
