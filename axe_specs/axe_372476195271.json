For listings in which the shipping costs aren't specified, the buyer can choose to include shipping costs in their offer.\" In keeping with the above eBay policy regarding the Best Offer feature, all Best Offer prices submitted by buyers will be processed by me as for the item only, never for the shipping costs. This will be the case regardless of whether a reduction of the shipping costs was entered as a \"term\" of the offer by the buyer. Shipping costs that are already specified by me and appearing in my listings are non-negotiable through the Best Offer feature. Any terms set by buyers for a reduction of shipping costs will simply not be honored. This is a policy eBay has created to protect sellers, given that we can now pre-fill our listings to automatically accept Best Offers at or over specific dollar amounts. When eBay automatically accepts the offer, it does not factor in or honor any written terms submitted by the buyer, but instead processes the submitted price as the item-only price. Hence the policy and my inability to honor such terms submitted by buyers through the Best Offer feature. Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have! Your item will ship as quickly as possible. Most of the time I am able to ship same-day or the next day. I ship business days via USPS and I use priority mail on most of my items.", "ItemID": "372476195271", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T20:37:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-20T15:38:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lawsuit-Era-6-String-Electric-Guitar-Made-Japan-/372476195271", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Gresham, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3724761952718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg1NTM=/z/q7UAAOSw3LVbzhng/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MDQ=/z/mh4AAOSwpY5bzhni/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTY0/z/xXcAAOSwihVbzhnl/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1Nzk=/z/JQsAAOSweopbzhnm/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5Mjg=/z/p7AAAOSwfxBbzhno/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFgxNjAw/z/OPAAAOSwyWxbzhnq/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~4wAAOSw1IVbzhnt/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODYxWDE2MDA=/z/NH4AAOSwnfZbzhnv/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwMFgxNTk5/z/PwIAAOSwGsJbzhny/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5M1gxNjAw/z/QXsAAOSwWgdbzhn1/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5M1gxNjAw/z/vLoAAOSwvv1bzhn3/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTc1WDE2MDA=/z/WEMAAOSwYIpbzhn5/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "97080", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "infinitej0y", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4744, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 539.1, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 539.1, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1075}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Lawsuit Era 6-String Electric Guitar *Made in Japan*", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Yellow with Glitter"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["L6-S"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}]}, "HitCount": 477, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1237146163", "StoreName": "infiniteDEALS and More"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "In fair condition.
