Comes with: Original hardshell caseSigned & dated factory quality checklistGibson Gold Warranty informationOwner's ManualCharging cable, power adapters, and wrench for the Min-ETune system Min-ETune quick start guideCleartone guitar strings information Plus... A pack of approx. 70 new Gibson thin standard guitar picks! There may possibly be some very light pick marks on the pick guard (which still has its protective plastic film intact so any minor scratches are in the plastic film not the actual pick guard!). This guitar is as close to *New* as possible, near perfect condition. This is a 2014 Gibson SG Standard that includes the new Min-ETune automatic tuning system. It's also one of the Gibson 120th Anniversary models and has a special commemorative marking on the guitar's 12th fret. I purchased this SG new in 2014. The guitar is in perfect condition. There are no dings, dents, scratches or other such marks. This guitar is as close to perfect condition as you can get. I very rarely played this guitar, so it has very low playing time (probably less than a few hours). It still has the protective plastic film on the pick guard. Mechanically, everything is in good working order. The Min-ETune system is working perfectly but the battery needs pushed in a bit further to get the system to power up. I simply push the battery in a bit further and use a pick to keep it in place (see photo). It's always been the case and seems to be a known issue with this system. Works like a champ with this little shortcut! It's essentially a 'new guitar'. Someone will be getting a great deal with this guitar and low to market starting price.
