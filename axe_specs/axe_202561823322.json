{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The guitar is in excellent working condition, sounds and feels spectacular just like those from custom shop.The action of the strings is set to very low, yet you can press any string on any fret along the neckand there is no buzzing sound. The fret condition is I would describe near perfect for the guitar's age, I can hardly see any fret wear.The guitar neck was confirmed to be perfectly straight,and the truss rod is working as it is supposed to. The electronics and tuners have no issues at all. Comes with new Dean Markley 10-46 NickelSteel strings.The neck/headstock joint has been repaired due to a minor crack in that area. The cracked area was epoxy glued, and two screws were driven from headstock down the neck to prevent this from happening again.The repairs did not affect the performance or the guitar in any way. The repaired areas can be now refinished and stained.The guitar comes with new TKL case. The guitar is located in Canada but I will ship from from Blaine,WA Please note, I will ship only to USA and Canada. Buy with confidence.", "ItemID": "202561823322", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T08:03:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-09T21:11:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1974-Gibson-SG-Standard-/202561823322", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Blaine, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025618233228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/D-IAAOSw6eRcNlf3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IOgAAOSw0d1cNlff/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GtgAAOSwWapcNlfi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AtAAAOSwxO9cNlfk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0rcAAOSwBZBcNlfn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IPQAAOSw0d1cNlfq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5toAAOSwWz5cNlfs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UdsAAOSwEKxcNlfv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3ZQAAOSwkelcNlfx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZtkAAOSwcGpcNlf0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "98230", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "symphony250", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 101, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "x***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1528}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1974 Gibson SG Standard", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Standard"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1974"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 162, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "There are some scuffs on the body, hardware, and headstock, and some repairs have been done to the headstock as pictured", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
