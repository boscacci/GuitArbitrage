{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": ">> --> >> --> Description >> --> The sound and making of domestically produced Burny Les Paul type in the 1980s are very reputable, this individual is also different from its reputation, I think that the state is good for the age. This is about 3.8 kg lightweight class of individualsThere are also left and right truss rods. I think there are 80% of frets. There is a shallow snake on the low fret side, but I think that it is not a serious grime like it affects pitch or performance.Of course it is a fret edge binding. The string is a new Elixir NanoWeb, with 10 to 46 gauge stretched.The pickup has been replaced with the rear only gibson burst backer. Because there is no tester, I do not know the type of burst backer, but not only winding strings but also plain strings are sticky, there is a clear distortion method where the core of sound remains It is with a soft case.There are fine scratches, but it is in very good condition.Please check photos that show the main damages and flaws on the item.
