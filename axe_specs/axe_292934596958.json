{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Well-used 1976 Guild S-100 (s/n 135784), black, with hard shell case. I bought it about 5 years ago and it\u2019s led a comfortable life of semi-retirement in my house since, but I have no idea what kind of trouble it got into before me. It suffered a neck break at some point; you can see two cracks running from each side of the nut and down the back of the neck. Whoever repaired it did a solid glue job to stabilize the neck, but they obviously weren\u2019t concerned about the cosmetics. The nut has been replaced and the fretboard binding is loose on the bottom (treble/high E) side from about the 2nd fret to the 6th fret; I assume both of these resulted from the neck break. I\u2019ve had a few professional set-ups done on it over time, and I think the local techs have always done a good job of getting the neck & fretboard pretty straight just through truss rod adjustments. (I\u2019ve tried to show that here in a couple of photos.) I measured the 3rd, 7th, and 12th frets with feeler gauges, and to me they feel about .035. The only things I\u2019ve done to it outside of set-ups is to put on an old stock Guild volume knob and a new Guild strap end pin (both of which were missing when I bought the guitar), and I replaced the washers and nuts for the knobs, switches, and cable jack. The tuning machines and pickups appear to be original, but I\u2019m not sure about the pots. There are plenty of little dings and nicks all over the guitar, but nothing crazy considering its age (except the neck break, of course). Practically speaking, the guitar sounds and feels great. It has that classic 70s Guild HB-1 sound, exactly like what you hear on early Soundgarden albums (think Screaming Life and Ultramega OK). It plays just fine for me in spite of the neck repair, but I\u2019m not a Juilliard-trained musician. It\u2019s the most naturally resonant solid-body electric I\u2019ve ever owned, and more so than the two other S-100s I\u2019ve had. It\u2019s noticeably heavier than the \u201873 S-100 I used to have: ~7.5 lbs vs. ~6.6 lbs. I believe the hard shell case is original, in spite of not having a Guild logo. It looks old enough and is identical to the case for the \u201873. Sold as-is, no warranty or returns. Let me know if you have any questions, and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them.
