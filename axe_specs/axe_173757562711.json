{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "No reserve, high bid wins. For auction is a 2015 Fender American Special Stratocaster in Sonic Blue with a Rosewood fingerboard and Fender G&G Tweed case. Pickups are DiMarzio: Injector Neck, Area 58 Middle, Virtual Solo Bridge. Tuners are Fender-Schaller American Series Staggered, made in Germany (not the stock Ping tuners!). I have a picture of the package label to prove they are Schallers. Also included are a set of Schaller \u201cS\u201d label two-pin locking tuners that are drop in replacements on this guitar (they were actually on the guitar briefly). Also comes with hang tags, manual, tremolo arm, Allen wrenches, and keys for tweed case. You get everything you see in the pictures. Guitar is near mint, with very little fret wear (hardly visible). No dings, or scratches that go through the finish. I took care of this instrument and it\u2019s almost like new. Everything works as it should. Pickguards are mint green and have been sanded with fine sandpaper for a more dull, vintage look. The guitar plays well, but you may need to have it set up for your own preferences. Strings are D\u2019Addario 10-46. Guitar has been described accurately, and is sold as-is. Please ask questions if you are unsure about anything. Shipping is $30, guitar will be shipped via FedEx ground. I ship to the Continental United States only. Payment is to be made immediately via PayPal at the end of the auction. The item has been described and depicted accurately, all sales are final.
