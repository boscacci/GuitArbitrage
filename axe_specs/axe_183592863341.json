{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For your consideration, a 2000 Les Paul Standard Dealer Model. Only ten of these are said to exist. In 2000 Gibson was really getting into the pick-up game, so they designed these guitars for trade shows, with access in the back to allow the quick change of pickups for demo purposes. It is in every way a 2000 Les Paul standard with a flame top. It has that thinner profile, 60's neck. Mine just has better pickups: two bare-knuckle pickups (Mule in Neck and Nailbomb in bridge.) I also had a Bigsby installed. What I like about this guitar is that it is slightly more resonant than other Les Paul Standards I have owed. You get some of the best cleans I have ever heard with a LP, and when you flip it down to the nailbomb, and give it some distortion, it goes \"dirty\" real fast, taking from Ace Freshley and Kiss, Led Zeppelin, or Guns and Roses, to more modern metal sounds depending on your set-up. I don't have a case for it, but can get a hard-shell, les paul case if you really want one, or really need it because you don't want it shipped any other way. Just let me know in your offer, if you expect a hardshell case, or maybe you have one, and you just want a better a price. I will ship it in a guitar box, packed well, and via Fedex.", "ItemID": "183592863341", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T17:34:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T15:46:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2000-Les-Paul-Standard-Dealer-Model-/183592863341", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Maitland, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835928633418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r1gAAOSwdHpcFl7e/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-UsAAOSwkERcFl7c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/snwAAOSwXF5cFl7e/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AAEAAOSwyYRcFl7b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/W0kAAOSw5-hcFl7c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MycAAOSw1KRcFl7b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4bsAAOSwwSJcFl7b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32751", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tradersnexus", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 706, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.1}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1574.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1574.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1502}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2000 Les Paul Standard Dealer Model\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 454, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
