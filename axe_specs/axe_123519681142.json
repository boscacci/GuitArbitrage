{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2006 Reverend Club King 290 w/ OHSC American Made Parts and Setup! This year was a transition year for Reverend, with production shifting to the Korean plant. Some guitars were American made, some were Korean made in 2006. These guitars were made to very high specs and were constructed using American parts. This guitar was owned by a praise/worship guitarist in church only. Midnight black finish with a beautiful roasted maple neck. Very high quality build, with that signature Reverend sound! Being a black guitar, every little imperfection is visible. It has signs of use because it was used every Sunday for many years. The frets are in great shape with very little wear, the body has scratches and dings. The worst scratch is on the back, I took a picture of it and it kind of looks like a dog hair. The Bigsby and roller bridge are not original, but the original bridge and hardtail are included. There are also 6 locking tuners and 6 original tuners included. Reverend original hardshell case is also included. There is an invoice for the Bigsby install as well. This is a very versatile guitar, would be great for recording, live work, or just playing at home.SPECS:BODY-Semi-hollow Korina, Solid Spruce TopPICKUPS-9A5 Bridge, 9A5 NeckBRIDGE-Bigsby B-50 with Roller BridgeNECK-Roasted Maple, Rosewood fretboardSCALE-25 1/2\"Bass Contour KnobCase Included!
