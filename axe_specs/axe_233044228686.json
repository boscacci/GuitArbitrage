{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gretsch Streamliner G2420T Hollow Body Single Cut Electric Guitar - SKU#1044349 SKU: 1044349 Item Condition E+ Excellent Plus - May have slight wear, but only visible under close up inspection. Item Description Big, bold and righteous, the G2420T Streamliner Single Cutaway Hollow Body with Bigsby is designed for the modern guitarist who yearns for something beyond the norm. A commanding guitar for powerful players, the G2420T's modern sonics, updated electronics and authentically elegant style create the latest iteration of That Great Gretsch Sound! The secret to the Streamliner's sound is a new offering from Gretsch-the Broad'Tron humbucking pickup. Specifically designed by the expert engineers at Gretsch for the Streamliner, this high-output pickup spawns robust lows, pristine highs and a throaty midrange for a unique tone that blends well with other instruments in a band context. This sonic power is harnessed and shaped by the traditional control layout-neck and bridge pickup volume controls, a master tone control, master volume control and three-way pickup switching. A fast-playing 12\"-radius rosewood fingerboard with elegant pearloid block inlays and 22 medium jumbo frets sits atop the white-bound nato neck with a thin \"U\"-shaped profile-ideal for chord work or firing off hot-rodded riffing. Add some shimmer and expression to your playing with the Bigsby-licensed B60 vibrato tailpiece while the Adjusto-matic bridge with secured rosewood base and synthetic bone nut grant amazing tuning stability. All the classic eye-catching style you have come to expect from Gretsch is here-vintage-style gold control knobs, F Holes, elegant two-ply white and black body binding, slick-looking nickel hardware, arched laminated maple construction and single-ply black pickguard with Gretsch logo. Nearly impossible to put down once you pick it up and start playing, the G2420T Streamliner Single Cutaway Hollow Body with Bigsby is an astounding take on the classic sound and style you've come to expect from Gretsch.
