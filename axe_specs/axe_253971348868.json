{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This started it's life out as an Affinity. It's an alder body maple neck with rosewood. I sanded and refinished the neck in satin, dressed the frets, logo'd and sealed it 70's style. Touched up the scratches and chips. It looks really sweet. It was easy, the guitar is black. Added Dual Rails with 500k pots, They sound as good as dual rails sound. They're quiet and hot. In all seriousness these are another humbucking strat pickup alternative to Duncan's or Dimarzio's. They're so good that I'd say it's a matter of preference. Here's a video of the guitar being played through a not great amp. Sounds hot! If you're looking for a really nice cheap guitar it's here. This outplays ANY Mexican Strat or Squier. Video or https://youtu.be/Y9P4KrjxLlg if the link doesn't work. You can own a very nice 70's look a like for a lot less. It'll even ship in a Fender box. Be sure you want it. I will not accept a return. I don't want a guitar returned to me after someone messes around with it.", "ItemID": "253971348868", "EndTime": "2018-11-15T16:44:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-08T16:44:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-70s-Stratocaster-Partscaster-/253971348868", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2539713488688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1NVg1MzA=/z/ofoAAOSwVZ5b2ytI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-v0AAOSwdmlb2yhM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MK0AAOSwYj9b2ygH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nJoAAOSwB8Rb2yhf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/m3sAAOSwHjtb2yht/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gK4AAOSwxdNb2yh9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "60646", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "yjmalmsteen", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 735, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 178}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squier 70's Stratocaster Partscaster", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 135, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 127.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "It's all good", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
