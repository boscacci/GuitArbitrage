{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Greetings! Up for auction is a pristine 2017 Gibson Flying V T! The guitar comes with its original hardshell case and original case candy. The guitar has been played less than two hours since purchased. I purchased the guitar new as a collectors item. The guitar has never been gigged. It has a mahogany body and mahogany neck. I believe the fingerboard is grenadillo. It plays fast and the guitar is very well balanced with a strap. The guitar is so new, that it still has the original strings from the factory. The guitar comes equipped with dual dirty fingers humbucking pickups which are very hot. It is a beautiful guitar. I am selling to the lower 48 states. The guitar is sold as is. If you have any questions, concerns, or would like to request more photographs, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am more than happy to answer any and all inquiries.", "ItemID": "113497140511", "EndTime": "2019-01-04T06:41:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-28T06:41:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Flying-V-T-Electric-Guitar-Ebony-Finish-HARDSHELL-CASE-STRAP-2017-/113497140511", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Los Angeles, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134971405118080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lJUAAOSw8L5cJcMV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1uAAAOSwsPNcJcMa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uDUAAOSwaSVcJcMd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hFEAAOSwIw1cJcMf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OiEAAOSwztVcJcMi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90059", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "prepe2013", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 55, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 90}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Flying V T Electric Guitar in Ebony Finish HARDSHELL CASE + STRAP 2017", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Flying V T"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Type", "Value": ["Electric Guitar"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Ebony"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["DSV17EBCH1"]}]}, "HitCount": 325, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 820.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
