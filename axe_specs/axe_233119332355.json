{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Used Fender Jazzmaster in surf green nitro lacquer. This guitar is used, and has some marks to prove it. All electronics work perfectly and the guitar plays really nicely! Low action and the tuning is quite stable for a Jazzmaster. This is a pre-CITES guitar so it has the more desirable Rosewood fretboard. The lower bout has some dark marks in the lacquer, and the neck has a small finish chip that was filled in with what I think is rubber cement. It doesn\u2019t look to go down to the wood, but I didn\u2019t want to sand the neck finish to confirm. I am a hobbyist guitar player, not a store, so I cannot accept returns. Please ask any questions before you commit to purchase. If you buy the guitar, you must pay. I will not cancel orders. I ship all guitars fully insured and professionally packed. A previous owner was a smoker so there is a very light cigarette odor, mostly in the included hard case. I have aired the guitar and case out and the smell is all but gone, but I want to be up front about it.
