{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "UP FOR AUCTION IS: Fender Stratocaster MIM Midnight Blue w/ HSC. This item is pre-owned and does have light scratches and knicks as shown in item pictures. The item is a Fender Stratocaster Made in Mexico, unsure but believe it is a 2000. Frets are worn from use. Item still plays well though. Please keep in mind we are a second hand seller and we are not guitar experts which means item may have issues we are unaware of but seems to be in decent condition and as I said sounds nice.
