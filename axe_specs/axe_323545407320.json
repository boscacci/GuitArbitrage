{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I bought this guitar new from MF in 2014. It's a fantastic guitar. Great, comfortable Gibson hollow-body tone with a weight of 7 pound 4 ounces on my scale. I put the pickguard on myself and designed and built the mount so it would match the curve of the guitar body. Added two holes to the guitar to do it, but it's mounted on solid wood. Selling because I have too many guitars and recently modified an ES-335 studio with soft edge, so I don't need two of these. It's in very good condition with little fret wear and no major dings or scratches. All around great guitar at a great price. PLEASE NOTE: I only sell to USA and ship to continental US. No returns unless D.O.A. so bid accordingly and ask any questions. I've bought and sold a lot of guitars on eBay without complaint, so bid with confidence. Any issues must be addressed within 24 hours of receipt of guitar. Compact in size and price, but big on tone.A comfortable solidbody size with the warmth that a semi-hollow has to offer, the ES-339 Studio features Super \u201957 pickup (bridge), 57 Classic pickup (neck), Tone Pros AVR2 bridge ensure solid tone control at your fingertips. 100% American made, the Gibson ES339 Studio offers a minimized feature set that delivers pure Gibson Tone with every strum.Gibson's ES-339 found an immediate place in the hearts and hands of guitarists who worshiped the classic ES-335 look, feel and tone, but needed that time-tested versatility in a more compact package. The ES-339 Studio from Gibson Memphis nails all the benefits of its predecessors but with the popular Studio styling, for a no-compromises tone machine offering 100% American-made quality at an unbeatable price. The elegant lines of the original ES-335 are cleverly drawn down to render a familiar yet more compact playing experience in the ES-339 Studio. Its stripped-down Studio format offers a lack of binding with \"soft edged\" body contour, streamlined controls, and simplified gold headstock logo. A major savings in price and weight comes without losing one ounce of quality, though, as evident in its Grover Rotomatic tuners, TonePros AVR2 bridge and long-anchor tailpiece studs, CTS pots with Orange Drop tone caps, and Gibson's '57 Classic (neck) and hotter Super '57 (bridge) humbucking pickups.FEATURESBodyBody shape: Double cutawayBody type: Semi-hollow or chambered bodyBody material: LaminatedTop wood: 3-ply maple/basswood/mapleBack wood: 3-plyBody finish: Gloss LacquerOrientation: Right handedNeckShape: Tradition CWood: MapleJoint: Set-inScale length: 24.75\"Truss rod: HistoricFinish: Gloss LacquerFretboardMaterial: Torrified mapleRadius: 12\"Fret size: Medium jumboNumber of frets: 22Inlays: DotNut width: 1.675\" (42.5mm)PickupsConfiguration: HHNeck: '57 ClassicMiddle: Not applicableBridge: Super '57 ClassicBrand: GibsonActive or passive: PassiveSeries or parallel: ParallelPiezo: Not applicableActive EQ: Not applicableSpecial electronics: Orange drop capacitor, CTS PotsControlsControl layout: Master volume, tonePickup switch: 3-wayCoil tap or split: Not applicableKill switch: Not applicableHardwareBridge type: FixedBridge design: Tone Pro AVR-2Tailpiece: StopbarTuning machines: Grover RotomaticColor: NickelOtherNumber of strings: 6-stringSpecial features: Not applicableCase: Hardshell caseAccessories: Certificate of authenticityCountry of origin: United States", "ItemID": "323545407320", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T02:02:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T02:02:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/GIBSON-ES-339-Studio-2014-Vintage-Sunburst-HSC-Very-Good-condition-/323545407320", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fresno, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235454073208080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI3OFgxNjAw/z/XW8AAOSwEcxb6NEZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxOFgxNjAw/z/iWMAAOSwXMxb6NEW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDU1/z/sPcAAOSw-FRb6NEN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MzM=/z/WuQAAOSwL0Fb6NET/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzkz/z/vtsAAOSw0QBb6ND-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDM0/z/kaUAAOSwckVb6NEI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3NFgxNjAw/z/yhIAAOSwVRBb6NEb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ4MVgxNjAw/z/kQUAAOSw8Dpb6NEa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/34sAAOSwQXlb6NEh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUzOVgxNjAw/z/s8AAAOSwrpJb6NEh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODMzWDE2MDA=/z/smwAAOSwKSlb6NEc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjMy/z/qSMAAOSwA65b6NEN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "93728", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "skinnyorangecat", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 110, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 760.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 760.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "z***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 289}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "GIBSON ES 339 Studio 2014 Vintage Sunburst with HSC_Very Good condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2014"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-339"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 293, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 770.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
