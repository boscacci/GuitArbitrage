{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Selling a Jackson RRXT Christian Andreu Rhoads model guitar. A great step into the Rhoads guitar family, it offers the primary features befitting of a metal-oriented guitar, while stripping away the frills and fancy details to deliver a no-nonsense metal machine. The single pickup in the guitar has also been upgraded to help this guitar deliver the sound that modern metal guitarists desire.Main specs of the guitar:- Nato (eastern mahogany) body- 1-piece thru maple neck w/ graphite reinforcement and scarf joint- Rosewood fingerboard w/ compound radius (12\"-16\") - 22 jumbo frets- Tune-o-matic string-thru bridge- Jackson non-locking tuners The original Duncan Designed pickup was replaced with a DiMarzio Titan DP259 humbucker, which has opened up the guitar a lot. The nato wood is very nicely balanced tonally, closer to alder or basswood than mahogany, and it helps the guitar cut pretty well. The neck this thin and wide, making it easy to play for extended periods of time without discomfort. With the Titan installed, it's much tighter and punchier, and responds really well to lower tunings. It's not without battle scars, though (as is the case with most Rhoads guitars) - the longer wing has had a chunk taken out of it, as has the headstock. The joint where the fingerboard meets the neck also had some cracking near the nut - this has since been glued to prevent it from potentially separating from the guitar, and it doesn't impact playability whatsoever. A brand new set of 10-gauge strings were put on less than a week ago. I don't necessarily want to sell it, but my car died on me and I need to get a down payment together for a new one. Ships in a gig bag - nothing fancy, but it does the job. Any questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Thanks much!", "ItemID": "163426643496", "EndTime": "2018-12-14T21:20:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-11T21:20:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-Rhoads-Christian-Andreu-RRXT-Satin-Black-w-DiMarzio-Titan-/163426643496", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634266434968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3zEAAOSwG1JcECdT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nucAAOSwDYdcECc0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qrIAAOSwEVlcECcD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JMMAAOSwQXlcECcF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/a1wAAOSwxtVcECcH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GtAAAOSwXedcECcN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e3wAAOSwohVcECdi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/W18AAOSwt3hcECcL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PxwAAOSwwPRcECcP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4OVg3NzE=/z/fbIAAOSwohVcECkP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4OVg1NTg=/z/65oAAOSwuUlcECkm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "46268", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "awin3256", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 84, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.6}, "BidCount": 19, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 78}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson Rhoads Christian Andreu RRXT Satin Black w/ DiMarzio Titan ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["2919999568"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Case sold separately&lt;BR/&gt;"]}]}, "HitCount": 155, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 105.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
