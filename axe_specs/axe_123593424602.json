{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "UP FOR BIDS: One USED Epiphone Nighthawk Custom Reissue Guitar with Epiphone hard shell case. Case is in good shape with many scratches, marks and a few small tears on the tolex...but the latches work and the inside is mint. The guitar is in very good condition with no dents or deep scratches...just faint polishing \"swirl\" scratches. The chrome is starting to tarnish some and may buff out. The fretboard is in pristine shape. It has a 25.5\" scale length and features a combination of coil-splitting humbucker and single coil pickups. One Volume, One Push/Pull Coil-splitting Tone Knob and a 5-way switch. Guitar has had a recent setup and plays great with a nice low action. I'll be selling many guitars and basses in the future, so keep a lookout. I've been diagnosed with CMT disease and I'm losing my strength in both hands. IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ BEFORE PLACING A BID!
