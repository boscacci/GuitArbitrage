{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is an American Standard Telecaster in a Fender Custom color. The middle pickup is a RWRP Fender and is perfectly balanced, as far as the output and tone. It's done right and is turned ON/OFF with the push/pull tone pot. All the Tele \"twang\" and tones are retained AND by activating the middle pickup you get some really nice Stratocaster \"quack\" and all three pickups can be \"on\", too. The body has one blemish, on the edge of the upper treble-bout but it's hardly noticeable unless your looking for it (last 2 pictures). The neck is perfect with a rosewood fingerboard. The frets show little to no wear and the action is fast and smooth. Other than the tone pot, the entire guitar is original, from the tone cap to the tuners. I suspect the pickups are custom shop as they sound much \"hotter\" than standards. This is just a very solid, tight guitar with tastefully and professionally done pickup upgrade. You will not be disappointed. The case is a Kramer box case and the guitar fits perfectly and is very durable. Case shows signs of age and use but it definitely protects the guitar well and is a very usable fully functional case. No repairs or structural issues. The one blemish mentioned was touched up by the previous owner.", "ItemID": "303013304193", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T00:19:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T01:04:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2001-USA-Fender-Standard-Telecaster-Upgraded-3rd-Pickup-Nice-Shape-W-Case-/303013304193", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Wurtsboro, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030133041938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU2NFg1Mjg=/z/wYcAAOSwiwZcAZKp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1N1gxMDQ5/z/-voAAOSwZtRcAZK0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1MVg2Njg=/z/K4IAAOSw7OdcAZLC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQyOVg3NjU=/z/XxgAAOSwN5hcAZM~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIyOFg5NzM=/z/5iUAAOSwHrlcAZNT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyOVg3MTY=/z/p4AAAOSwo1lcAZNr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTU2WDcxNA==/z/mP8AAOSwiSVcAZN2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTIxWDU1MQ==/z/BMEAAOSwQZdcAZOG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUzM1g2MDQ=/z/NiwAAOSw5EpcAZOS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwNVg3NTk=/z/saUAAOSwqRlcAZOj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjA1WDkxMQ==/z/DwUAAOSwOnJcAZOy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "12790", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spallocollectibles", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 7954, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.2}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 999.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 999.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 11}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2001 USA Fender Standard Telecaster With Upgraded 3rd Pickup.
