Affordable and stylish, the SG Special is a great beginners guitar.Here's what Epiphone say about the SG Special with KillpotThe Epiphone SG Special is an incredible way to get real SG tone and styling without breaking the bank. In 1961, the original Les Paul shape was redesigned into a light, double-cutaway design. That new design soon became known as the \"SG\" and now, along with the original Les Paul, is the iconic \"rock\" guitar. Epiphone's G-400 and G-310 SG models have been best sellers in the guitar market for over 15 years featuring the carved SG-body shape at a \"workingman's price. In the summer of 1999, Epiphone introduced the SG-Special making it the most affordable SG on the market today. A Real SG, Made Right:This guitar, with it's devilish double-cutaway design, reigns supreme in access to all of it's 22 frets. It's bolt-on Hard Maple neck provides rigidity and durability while it's \"SlimTaper\" neck profile with Rosewood fingerboard make it comfortable and easy to play. A pair of hot open-coil, noise-free Humbucking pickups voiced specifically of the bridge position (700T) and neck position (650R) give you authentic rock tone with just the right amount of grit and growl. The Same Premium Features and More Even though the SG-Special is the most affordable SG in the line-up, it still features Epiphone's patented LockTone locking Tune-o-matic bridge and Stop-bar tailpiece for increased sustain and ease in string changing. The master volume and master tone controls each feature full-size 500K \ufffd potentiometers and Epiphone's rugged all-metal 3-way toggle pickup selector switch for long-lasting, dependable performance. The guitar features chrome hardware and is in Cherry finish. To top it all off, Epiphone has added their patented combination Tone/Killpot control. Turn it and it works like a regular tone control. Push it in and you have a momentary \"Kill\" switch which mutes all output for crazy Buckethead-like effects.Product SpecsCondition:Excellent (Used)Brand:EpiphoneModel:SG SpecialFinish:CherryCategories:Solid BodyYear:2016Made In:Indonesia", "ItemID": "173675722004", "EndTime": "2018-12-14T10:34:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-04T22:31:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EPIPHONE-CHERRY-RED-SG-SPECIAL-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-GT-KILL-POT-N-MINT-/173675722004", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "West Islip, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736757220048080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2pUAAOSwLKNbxLjX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XIIAAOSwiJhbxLjb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pX0AAOSwKA5bxLjf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OzEAAOSw21RbxLjj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDk1/z/tv8AAOSwQIFbxLjo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExMFgxNjAw/z/PdkAAOSw3mNbxLjt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6zgAAOSwuWJbxLjy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0MVgxNjAw/z/JdgAAOSwbetbxLj2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg0WDE2MDA=/z/AiEAAOSwORxbxLj6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExOFgxNjAw/z/jekAAOSwv6FbxLj9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjc5/z/OZcAAOSwdrhbxLkB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qn4AAOSw0QxbxLkG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11795", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jdstoyz1516", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 524, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.97, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.97, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 141}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EPIPHONE CHERRY RED SG SPECIAL ELECTRIC GUITAR with GT KILL POT N.
