{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1984 Gibson Les Paul Standard Gold Top chuck full of mojo! Solid body. This guitar is a beast! I've owned and sold a lot of Les Paul guitars in my day and this is one of the best ones I've ever played aside from my 69 Les Paul Gold top. Amazing harmonics and that classic vintage Les Paul growl. The only reason I'm selling is, I love playing fat neck guitars and recently obtained a Gibson Custom Shop JB edition. The 84 has a slim 60's style neck which is not really my thing, however makes playing everything from Metal to jazz absolutely effortless. She's top wrapped with 11's now, adds to the amazing tone, but easy on the fingers still with the top wrap set up (professionally done). I can't say enough about this guitar, I'm hoping it goes to a good home. It has that vibe you can only get from vintage guitars, from the smell to the sound, she's incredible. Some very minor nick's here and there, binding coloring aging as she's a 35 year old guitar and has been played, but that just adds to all that mojo in her. Take a good look at the pics. Even with all that though, she is in exceptional shape. Tim Shaw PUPs sounds amazing. The switch has a once in awhile crackle when changing pups, but it still has a lot of life in it I believe as it's very rare. That's the only flaw I can think of electronically. The sound of this guitar will blow anyone away. When I say it's a beast, I mean it. And she is heavy.. 11+ lbs. So she's a fat girl for you guys with the weak shoulders or back, you may want to pass on this if you are gigging out. I'm in no pressure to sell, so please don't message me with low offers. These guitars are all going up in price and hanging on to it will just make me more so no issues with that either. zero and negative feedback bidders, please don't bid. Your bids will be cancelled, been burned a few times and just easier that way. All funds must clear in Paypal before I will ship. Shipping is a flat 80 dollars to continental US. That includes professional packing from UPS/insurance. No international bidders. Balance due within 48 hours. Any questions please ask and thank you for looking.", "ItemID": "223316128827", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T01:57:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-08T00:50:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1984-Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-Gold-Top-/223316128827", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bridgewater, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233161288278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/YD4AAOSws99cLXqu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/8kgAAOSwIkNcLXq4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/JHQAAOSwlelcLXq9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/cEEAAOSwgbdcLXrZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/VZMAAOSwdxVcLXrg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/s2gAAOSw8fRcLXrn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/SSoAAOSwALpcLXrr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/pVMAAOSwIKNcLXry/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/wBMAAOSw5bxcLXr4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/EMoAAOSwxDJcLXr9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/YKgAAOSws99cLXsD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/YFoAAOSwxL5cLXsI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08807", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rajasthan77", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 278, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 747}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1984 Gibson Les Paul Standard Gold Top", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 8, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
