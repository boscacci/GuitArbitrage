{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Uncommon (\"Rare\" is so overused on Ebay) Fernandes ST80NT guitar in very good pre-owned condition. If you are looking at this, then you know how cool these are. My guess is that this one is from late 1988 as that was when they changed the model name. (Picture from the second 1988 Fernandes catalog at the end). This guitar started out as the Brad Gillis model in 1984. When his endorsement expired in 1987, it was rebranded as the Takeshi Nishiyama model (Guitarist from the Japanese band \"Hound Dog\".) The only changes from the BG model were to add the Fernandes branded FRT tremolo with fine tuners, and the input jack on the side of the body was moved down by an inch or so, (and the style changed to a plate type rather than the previous barrel type. The boost circuit with the top mounted input jack is unchanged from the Brad Gillis version and adds a really cool tone option. The neck is patterned from Brad's original '62 strat and is very fast and comfortable. Frets still have plenty of life. Paint is in good shape with some light scratches and creases. The worst one on the top I tried to catch with a reflection. All electronics work fine. Molded hardshell case. You will love this guitar.
