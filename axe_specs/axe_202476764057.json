{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "In amazing condition with normal dirt and wear from being used. There is only one small indent on the front top about 2mm in diameter which u can see in one of the pics. Neck is straight as an arrow, electronics are working 100%. Jackson hard case is in perfect condition inside with some warping on the top part of the outside which does not affect the case at all, all hinges and locks are solid. No key for the case as per usual :) The gold plate and gold knobs are from my RR5, could use a polish but look great either way, the swap is only cosmetic and all electronics are the stock ones that came with it. Also I moved the strap bolt up to one of the serial plate spots as seen in the pictures so the guitar balances perfectly.
