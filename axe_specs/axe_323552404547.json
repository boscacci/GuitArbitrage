{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Very clean all stock 1994 Standard Fender Telecaster made in the USA. The body has no major dings but does have finish scratches from normal wear and tear. Overall this Telecaster is in great shape for its age. The frets are in good shape, minimal wear. The neck has some minor dings on the back and some finish has worn off on some edges but overall the neck is straight and in good condition. The guitar sounds great and there are no issues with the electronics. The Tele comes with the original Fender hard shell case which is in great shape. Included with the guitar are the original hang tags, Fender sticker, allen wrenches, case key, and owners manual. The color is Midnight Blue however the color looks more like a deep purple. I recently put new strings on the tele however it could probably use a setup. I am trying to be as detailed as possible but please feel free to ask any questions about the guitar. I love the neck color and profile, the guitar is comfortable, easy to play, has great tone, and the color is rare. I am selling it because I have too many guitars. CONUS shipping only.
