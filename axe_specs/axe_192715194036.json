{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This auction is for an Epiphone Casino archtop hollow body electric guitar, which I purchased only three months ago. \u00a0I had a USA-made Bigsby B7 Vibrato tailpiece professionally installed on this guitar, along with a Graphtech TUSQ nut, and a GOTOH tune-o-matic bridge. \u00a0I also added amber knobs. \u00a0This guitar is an absolute gem in both appearance and tone. \u00a0I am only selling it because I need to reduce my number of hollow body guitars. \u00a0Take advantage of this opportunity to own a beautiful, high-quality upgraded guitar. \u00a0Also included an Epiphone hardshell case, which was purchased separately. \u00a0I removed the original white plastic pick guard, and can include that also, upon request. From Epiphone's website: Since 1961, the look and sound of the Casino has gone virtually unchanged and is still made today as a fully hollowbody archtop, now with powerful new Dogear P-90T Classic\u2122 pickups.\u00a0 The Casino body is made from 5-ply Maple with basswood top bracing. The top, back, and fingerboard have single-ply ivory binding. The Mahogany neck has a SlimTaper\u2122 \u201cD\u201d profile and is glued to the body at the 16th fret. The neck has a 24.75\u201d scale, a 1.68\u201d nut, and a Pau Ferro fingerboard with Pearloid \"Parallelogram\" inlays. The black bound white pickguard has a 60s era silver metal E logo.", "ItemID": "192715194036", "EndTime": "2018-11-13T22:05:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-06T22:05:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Casino-Archtop-Electric-Guitar-Cherry-P90-Pickups-Bigsby-B7-/192715194036", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Montgomery, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927151940368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTEz/z/b4wAAOSw~IFb1N7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2ODg=/z/9~0AAOSwN5Zb1N7u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYx/z/FRwAAOSwVYhb1N74/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MTE=/z/Az8AAOSw8KJb1N7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MzA=/z/2PAAAOSwrFZb1N7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5OQAAOSw5Xpb1N7v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODg=/z/J~YAAOSwRNtb1N7t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5Nzg=/z/CdwAAOSwAwVb1N7u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjczWDE2MDA=/z/cecAAOSw0Btb1N7u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60538", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "shadowcatrecords", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 307, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 124}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Casino Archtop Electric Guitar - Cherry - P90 Pickups - Bigsby B7", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Casino"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Bisgby B7 added"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Bigsby B7"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Laminated Maple"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Casino"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow Body"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["24.75&quot; Scale"]}]}, "HitCount": 221, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 504.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
