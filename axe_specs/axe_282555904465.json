{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This gorgeous semi-hollow T-style guitar was built by San Francisco luthier Doug Roomian. The instrument is about 12 years old. I am the third owner and the second owner in my family. I bought a new Fender G&L hard shell case for it about 5 years ago, which is included. The guitar has a maple top with a honey burst finish and maple binding. The back and sides are a very deep purple that looks almost black. It has a belly cut, unlike traditional Teles. The ebony fretboard rides a naturally-finished, thin T-style neck. Pickups are Seymour Duncan 59s wired as split coils for humbucker and single coil tones. It's a lovely jazz style guitar with a bright, clear, punchy tone. It also plays that incredible jangle in single coil mode. And it is extremely lightweight. On my scales it's 6.8 lb. The front and sides are virtually flawless. There are a few wear marks on the back (see photos). The case also has a few smudges on it, but is otherwise like new. Someone will enjoy this instrument!
