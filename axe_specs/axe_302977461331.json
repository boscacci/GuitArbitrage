{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This one has the whole package! Up for sale is a 1956-1957 Fender Musicmaster guitar. Featuring a slate of exceptionally rare fender case candy, this collectible package is becoming harder and harder to come by in the current market. This particular 50s polish cloth, hang tag, strap, and cable all can run you quite a bit of money to purchase on their own. It\u2019s exceptionally rare to find them all with their original factory instrument. Notice specially how the serial number on the hangtag matches the neck plate! Very cool! The guitar itself in excellent condition. There is very little fret wear, and only some minor pick wear to the body. The tuner buttons have deteriorated on the timers. So they will need to be rebuttoned, or you can put on a different set of era correct timers, which are widely available. There\u2019s also a handful of finish blemishes on the back of the neck, where it looks like the guitar rested on the cable for an extended period and reacted with the finish. I called this \u201ccase wear.\" Don\u2019t miss out!", "ItemID": "302977461331", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T04:41:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-29T19:06:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1956-1957-Fender-Musicmaster-Hang-Tags-Desert-Sand-Duo-Sonic-/302977461331", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Marysville, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029774613318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/qh8AAOSwoYFbqWn1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/-6MAAOSwRNhbqWpZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/qPIAAOSwN~ZbqWp0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/cl4AAOSw8lhbqWpf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/QZUAAOSwsuNbqWpv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ2NlgxNDcx/z/EaQAAOSww6ZbqWqK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/oTQAAOSwNp1bqWqU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/oHMAAOSwcR9bqWpP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98270", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "swinbad", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 506, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 766}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1956-1957 Fender Musicmaster Hang Tags Desert Sand Duo-Sonic", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}]}, "HitCount": 449, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=87310389", "StoreName": "Swin&#39;s Deals and Steals"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
