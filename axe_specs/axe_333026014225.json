{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The White Holiday is a reproduction of the piezo- and vibrato bar-equipped fiberglass Supro electric guitar that was first manufactured in Chicago during the early 1960s. The White Holiday reissue mates a chambered body with a newly developed, composite \u201cAcousti-glass\u201d top. This updated construction preserves the instrument\u2019s Art Deco aesthetics and signature blend of piezo and magnetic pickups, while improving its semi-hollow acoustic resonance and tuning stability.The White Holiday\u2019s vintage-correct tuners, vibrato bar and adjustable, piezo-equipped rosewood bridge are joined by a faithful replica of the legendary Vistatone pickup to bring you a fully realized and worthy reissue of this classic Supro guitar. The Vistatone pickup found in the Supro White Holiday is a reproduction of the groundbreaking, single-coil design developed for Valco by Ralph Keller in the early 1950s. The Vistatone pickup is cited as prior art in Seth Lover\u2019s PAF patent and is found in many of the most desirable vintage Supro models The Supro White Holiday is acoustically resonant, and this voice translates through the bridge-mounted piezo pickup, which can be used independently or blended with the magnetic Vistatone pickup.Our semi-hollow recipe of an Acousti-glass top and semi-hollow body retains the unique sonic characteristics of the original piezo-equipped Supro White Holiday guitar while providing today\u2019s musicians with a lightweight, highly playable instrument that stays in tune and is easy to maintain.
