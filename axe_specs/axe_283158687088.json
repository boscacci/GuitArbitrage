{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Please note that I am a long-time guitar seller on eBay with over $171,000 in sales and 100% feedback!! Outstanding tone and playability with this PRS Custom. This light bodied guitar features the best humbuckers possibly ever made......... early model GIBSON PAF Custom Shop Burstbuckers #1 and #2. I am not certain of the year these were made but they came from an early 2000's Les Paul that had a severely broken neck. I have had several guitars driven by Burstbuckers so I immediately bought them for $350. Later, I bought the PRS Custom and was not happy with the power and tone of its original pickups. I am a blues player and had some experience with the classic tone of the GIBSON Burstbuckers. The PRS was very light for on stage work and quite homestly, I love the sound of hollow bodied guitars such as the Gibson 335. So I took this early Burstbucker combination #1 and #2 had them professionally installed in this PRS. Wow... unbelievable gutsy blues tone on a guitar that is easy and light to handle. ! Anyone who plays high-end guitars knows about the early Custom Shop GIBSON Burstbucker combination (#1 & #2).AudioFanzine describes the early #2 Bucker as follows: \"These pickups are some of the more versatile pickups I've ever played. The great thing about them is that they sound awesome in many different guitars. I really like the sound that they can produce with the Les Paul (who doesn't?) but I also have a great appreciation for what they can do with a hollow-body. Before these PAF's came around, hollow-bodies could not handle any type of distortion, as they'd feed back tremendously. That changed with these guys, and now hollow-bodied guitars are used in rock music\" \"The harmonics are great, super warm and expressive.\" Burstbucker #2..... It's my home... the music in my ear with my Burstbuckers 2 in the bridge Think of the tone of Gary Moore and early Peter Green) Let's face the simple fact that PRS is one of the premier guitar builders in the world. Some now think that craftsmanship in South Korea now surpasses even the US. This PRS Custom does not only sound spectacular, it also has the look of a far more expensive guitar. The light-brown, matched flamed boy stands out whenever one looks at this beauty. The neck is very smooth and very fast. Condition: This sexy hollow-body sounds great I can't find a mark or ding anywhere on it. It looks brand new! Frets are in excellent condition and it looks like this guitar has not been played very much. Want to be the one to break it in? This guitar comes with a well-made and padded PRS gigbag.......see pic. Great guitar at a great price.............
