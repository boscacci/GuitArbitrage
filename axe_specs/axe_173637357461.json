{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1986 Fender MIJ Pink Paisley Telecaster - AS-IS, NO RESERVE! I really hate to let this one go, but I have too many guitars and I'm cleaning out the closet! Nice MIJ Pink Paisley Telecaster from 1986. Good player, sounds nice. Maple neck and fretboard. Model TL-69-75. Neck date 3/25/1986. This has been modified by a previous owner to have 3 pickups, Nashville style. As far as I know the bridge and neck pickups are original to the guitar, the middle pickup is Strat style. I am unsure of the maker of the middle pickup. Middle pickup rout looks professional. It had an unknown vibrato system on it at one point. There is an extra plate under the bridge, and the cavity has been filled with a block of wood. Rout looks professional. It looks like it also had a locking nut on the neck. Guitar has a Les Paul style jack plate on it. Tuners are vintage Schaller West Germany. Guitar has various dings and scratches, but overall looks good. The finish is not the bubblegum pink that newer models have, it has aged to an almost burnt-orange appearance. Very attractive! Someone tried to scratch off the Made in Japan stamp at the bottom of the neck, but you can see where it was. Guitar has a slight hum sometimes that goes away when I tap on the volume knob, maybe a bad pot. I never messed with it because it never bothered me that much. No case included, but I will pack securely and ship well. This item is sold AS-IS, no returns. I have attempted to describe this item as best as possible. Please contact me with any questions or additional photos! I am using eBay's shipping calculator. Winning bidder will pay for shipping. Alaska and Hawaii will be extra. Local pickup is allowed. I will not ship this item out of the United States. No international bidders please! Again,this is an AS-IS item that has no return. Please see all pictures and ask all questions prior to bidding. Thanks!", "ItemID": "173637357461", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T19:57:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T19:57:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1986-Fender-MIJ-Pink-Paisley-Telecaster-NO-RESERVE-/173637357461", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tampa, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736373574618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/xPEAAOSwAFFb6c18/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/vd8AAOSwvYRb6c1h/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/pw8AAOSwAbxb6c1h/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/G5cAAOSwvoxb6c1i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/fZUAAOSwn~Rb6c1h/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/d~kAAOSwMQ1b6c1i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/DmUAAOSwIUVb6c1i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/eEUAAOSwnCdb6c2S/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/XgoAAOSwF8Fb6c2z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc1WDUwMA==/z/vY0AAOSwwdNb6c26/$_32.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/PYIAAOSw0-Fb6dZp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/yEQAAOSwuJRb6daB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33612", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cwp0126", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 339, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 55, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 89}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1986 Fender MIJ Pink Paisley Telecaster - NO RESERVE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1986"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Pink"]}]}, "HitCount": 976, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 620.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
