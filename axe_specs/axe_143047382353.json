{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Includes case. Stereo inputs.On Dec-16-18 at 19:12:50 PST, seller added the following information: In response to questions I've been asked: Input above is a typo. It should read stereo outputs. The guitar saw very little use. It was the least used of my 4 guitars and has been in the case for most of the last 35 years. I am the original owner and the guitar seldom left my house. There are a few scratches and there is one tiny ding on the low side of the neck. The scratches can be seen next to the large access panel on the back. The ding is just above and to the right of the pick. Nothing is deep. The neck is straight and the frets are in great shape. The strings are 35 years old. The pots and switches all work. There are reflections on the photos that might look like dents are scratches, but aside from what I've described there isn't anything. I can take more pictures if anyone is concerned.", "ItemID": "143047382353", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T23:58:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T23:58:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ovation-UK-II-1291-Black-1978-Guitar-/143047382353", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Englewood, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430473823538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NDI=/z/fGwAAOSw6jJcDvut/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H9gAAOSwOHpcDvuz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cj8AAOSwaaNcDvu4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EC4AAOSw~5dcDvu-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dCoAAOSwWAhcDvvD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNTY1/z/DwUAAOSwNYtcDvvJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQxWDE2MDA=/z/RtgAAOSwSlpcDvvM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-DYAAOSw6X1cFxEn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80113", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "michaelackerman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 36, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 8, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 417.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 417.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 239}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ovation UK-II 1291 Black 1978 Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ovation"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["UK-II"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["UK-II"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 198, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 422.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
