{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Ebony 2016 Epiphone Sheraton II Pro is in mint new condition.It has a beautiful ebony finish with gold hardware and comes with its original hard shell case. This guitar is MINT MINT ! From a non smoking home and never left the house. New baby means no more noise in the house so the last of my small guitar collection has got to go per the wife.Check my 100% feedback as seller for other guitars I have sold to trim my collection. For a full description see the Epiphone website at \"\"http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Electrics/Archtop/Sheraton-II-PRO.aspx\"\" Has coil split on the humbuckers to single coil sound. This is NOT a refurbished guitar. I bought it at a Sam Ash music store new and had time to thoroughly inspect it before buying. Validate the serial number 1610204072 in the pic at \"\"http://www.guitardaterproject.org/epiphone.aspx\"\" Beware of any guitar when the seller conveniently does not show the serial number. I once asked about a guitar on ebay for the seller to \"share\" a pic of the serial number and the seller flamed me, called me an idiot and how the sellersold many guitars and I was ridiculous to ask such a stupid question. Also, Epiphone refurbished serial numbers often start with the first two digits \"31 or EE\". The first two digits are supposed to be the year of manufacture, like 16 for 2016. Brand new D\u2019Addario .09 to .42 extra light strings. No fret buzzing and low action set at .060 inch at the 12th fret.Epiphone case included. Will ship in case in a strong guitar shipping box. This guitar has the most sustain of any guitar I ever had with any of the (2) ProBucker pickups and the heavier wood body. Was very happy with the this piece. Please see the epiphone website link above.", "ItemID": "173664697369", "EndTime": "2018-12-05T15:45:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-28T15:45:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Sheraton-II-Pro-2016-Ebony-w-case-MINT-MINT-/173664697369", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Palm Coast, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736646973698080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6ncAAOSw0VZbnSOx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RvkAAOSwMtpbnSOq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AsAAAOSwt-NbnSOr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SOUAAOSwuxhbnSOv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1kkAAOSwA71bnSOv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yvMAAOSwJFhbnSO0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XMoAAOSwsl9bnSO0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mhIAAOSwS0pbnSYa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-PsAAOSwr8tbnSO1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sWQAAOSwjuFbnSOy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wu4AAOSw1ZBbnSSU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/z8kAAOSwEslbnSRt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32164", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "77-88", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 611, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 520.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 520.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "****l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 84}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Sheraton II Pro 2016 Ebony w case MINT MINT\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ebony"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Sheraton-II"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 83, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 530.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
