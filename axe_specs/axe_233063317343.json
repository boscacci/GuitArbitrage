{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Squier Jagmaster guitar for sale, modified/upgraded. Well-used and versatile, great for gigging especially if you have smaller hands. Unique for sure. Differs from stock in the following ways: - Nut replaced with zero fret for low - and I mean LOW - action - Upgraded pickups: Dimarzio Bluesbucker in the neck, Seymour Duncan JB in the bridge. Coil tapped but due to the polarity of the different manufacturers, middle is out of phase. Sounds cool to me, and it's great for funk and rock, but it's not for everyone. - Upgraded with gold speed knobs (original knobs included in gig bag) - Longer trem bar with some foam padding in the bottom of the socket so it doesn't rattle around - Silenced trem springs (no reverberation) - Set up for D'Addario standard 10's (will include a new pack with the guitar) Condition: - Light fret wear - frets are maybe 90%. They were small/low from the factory which gives the neck a vintage feel (not sure if this is normal on this model or not) - Body/neck has a few chips and dings in the finish, but looks nice from the front. Maybe 80% condition - Pickguard between the bridge pickup and bridge is heat damaged - was this way when I bought it. Never noticeable while gigging because your hand is always over it - Pick scratches, etc. Doesn't look trashed but it is obviously a USED guitar - it's even stamped \"USED\" on the back of the headstock Overall: Sounds great, plays great. Perfect for the person who needs to gig or record and really wants a Strat, but with a shorter (24\") neck & narrow bridge OR wants that Nirvana/grunge sound. Good backup guitar too. Alder body, not basswood, so sounds great. I have smaller hands and it's served me very well but I have a custom guitar I'm using now and don't need this one anymore. As this is a highly modified guitar, it is being sold AS-IS. It's guaranteed to work but please be sure you know what you're buying and why you're buying it. Questions welcome.
