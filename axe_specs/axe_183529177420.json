{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1989-90 Charvel 550XL Professional Series Hello. Please consider purchasing this very good example of a Charvel 550XL professional series guitar in turquoise. It was made in Japan in 1989 or 1990, I am the second owner and a fan of these toothpaste logo era Charvel guitars. I am not a Charvel expert and everything I know I have learned from Charvel fans in the guitar community. Rarely have I seen a Charvel 550XL in this nice of condition, but it is used and there are signs of use. There are no noticeable cracks, dents, paint chips, gouges, but some light scuffs and hazing of clear finish typically seen with gentle use. The toothpaste logo fitted case has all functioning hinges and no noticeable cracks or dents. However, the case did have one lower latch repair done prior to me owning it. It is difficult to notice, but have done my best to photograph it (please see pictures). I have done my best to describe this guitar accurately with words and represent this item as accurately as I can in pictures. I recognize there are flash and light reflections off of the gloss finish and you are welcome to ask more specific questions and ask for more specific pictures prior to purchase. The Schaller locking guitar strap buttons shown in pictures will be replaced by the original Charvel non-locking buttons prior to shipping. Please understand the sale only includes: 550XL Charvel guitar with non-locking strap buttons, Charvel case and tremolo. Please also note that this is a sold As Is/ As Described guitar and I do not accept returns. I welcome any questions and will answer to the best of my knowledge, prior to purchasing.Neck through body24 frets 25 1/2 scale length neck3 way switchRosewood fretboardJackson TunersSingle coil neck pickupHumbucker bridge pickup\\m/", "ItemID": "183529177420", "EndTime": "2018-11-14T05:36:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-10T18:36:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/CHARVEL-JACKSON-550XL-Pro-Series-6-string-electric-guitar-Made-Japan-1989-90-/183529177420", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Portland, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835291774208080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUyOFg4OTM=/z/8K8AAOSwE9pb5xue/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4OVg5NTg=/z/RJgAAOSwdHpb5xup/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwMlg5ODY=/z/izYAAOSwVcZb5xsR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzMFg5MjY=/z/g5MAAOSwqmhb5xso/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MzE=/z/NMcAAOSweIlb5lIq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1Nlg4NzY=/z/mg8AAOSwteFb5lJN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzM0WDExNzg=/z/c2QAAOSwBYZb5lIe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4doAAOSwNp1b5lHh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vTEAAOSws29b5xtI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4N1gxMTYx/z/FnwAAOSwAfVb5xtm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NDE=/z/MbQAAOSwj6lb5lJ1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyMFgxMjAw/z/uewAAOSwukZb5xuA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "97213", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tblightning2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 98, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "CHARVEL JACKSON 550XL Pro Series 6 string electric guitar Made in Japan 1989-90", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1989-90"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Charvel 550XL Professional Series"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["Guitar and Case"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Turquoise"]}]}, "HitCount": 225, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
