It is the coolest guitar I have ever owned or seen. Billy Gibbons. Bo Diddly. TV Jones mojo. Gretsch Billy Bo very limited edition with the traditional Gretsch Western Orange color scheme and decorations you would find on a 50s Western Gretsch. Giddyup Cowboy. As Billy Gibbons explained about the birth of this model, \"Some time ago, Bo gave me the guitar as a gift. It was during the recent ZZ Top recordings, when the engineering crew and I snaked through the guitar vault searching for that certain-something guitar, and there it was! We didn't risk subjecting such a rare instrument to the rigors of the road. So this new reproduction model was recreated with some BFG mojo thrown in for good measure. It's now the main stage guitar with a groove.\" - Billy F Gibbons. Rock luminaries Billy F Gibbons and Bo Diddley have joined forces to bring you a 21st-century version of the elusive Gretsch\u00ae Jupiter Thunderbird now dubbed the Billy-Bo which was designed in '59 by the talented Bo Diddley himself! I have played it very little because it is like a perfect piece of art, and I have lots of other guitars.
