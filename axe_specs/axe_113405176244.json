{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This was the dream guitar I had spec'ed out for G&L to build, and they knocked it out of the park!!!So why am I selling it??? Simply because I've decided that I I would rather have had a fixed bridge since I don't use a term other than Bigsby style. So a standard tremolo was something I wanted, and I've decided that it's just not for me. Which is sad because this is unreal guitar!!! Here is copy of the actual order, and this should help you to see what was requested via my order through the legendary Dave's Guitar Shop in WI. Total cost of order was roughly around $2,200 when purchase a few months back. This guitar has less than one hour of playing time on it, and has never left the house, and includes the hard shell case that was provided by G&L.
