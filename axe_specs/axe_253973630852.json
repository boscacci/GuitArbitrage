About scratches that are hard to see.

Neck Mahogany. Maple Finger board. Frets 22F. Scale 24.75inch (628mm) Gibson Scale. Nut Width About 1.65 inch (42mm). Pickup MAXON by Nishin Onpa and Keiyo and Gotoh in japan. Control 2 Volume, 2 Tone, 3-Way PU Toggle switch. Bridge Tune O Machic. Stop Tailpiece. Color Natural. Weight About 9.63 Pound ( 4.37 Kg ). This is Used Guitar. I was shooting a lot of photos. Please confirm with a photograph. When I got it, I was surprised at the goodness of that condition. It is very beautiful... The Protective sheets of the Electric cavity plate and the Pick guard, It has not peeled off. Anyway very old model. It is a rare model and I do not see it much in the Japanese used guitars market. It was made about 45 years ago by Matsumoku. Although it is an very old guitar, I think that the scratch is little. I can not think that it is a electric guitar of about 45 years ago. This EG-550 manufactured 1973 is a Bolt-on neck. And since the late 1974 it became a Set-neck, the name was changed to EG-650N. The contour processing is given to the back of body and it fits the your body. That was Greco's idea at the time, and it was adopted as a proposal of the \"Shigeru Narumo\" of the japanese guitar player. Distinctive luster. I predict Lacquer paint. I think thin paint. About guitar play, Current state, the space between the strings and the frets is standard. Weight of this Greco is heavy. It is the same weight as a solid guitar. However this Greco is Semi Hollow body. Therefore Un pluged sound is very loud. You can feel vibrations transmitted to the body. Pickups is very Vintage sound. This MAXON Pickup is excellence. And worldwide assessment is high. I feel the good Over drive and Distortion sound. The clean sound is also wonderful. Greco is Great !! It is cleanliness. I polished with guitar exclusive polish, so it is in a very clean state. I cleaned the Fingerboard with Lemon Oil. Current neck condition, very good ! roughly straight ! There is no problem with the Truss rod and it can be adjusted. Remaining the frets are 50% on average. You can play immediately after it is delivered to you. I was set new strings. Regular tuning. ( Inch : 009, 011, 016, 024, 032, 042 ) Guitar playing, is comfortable. All is working well. It is in a very good condition. The Truss rod Wrench is not included. All Original.Note : The hard case key has been lost. Note : The Strap pin has been changed to lock type. Look at the photos, please verify by yourself! It will be professionally pack.
