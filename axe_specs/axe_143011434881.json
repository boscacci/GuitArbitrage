I know this 100 % as I am the original owner !! This killer axe has been well taken care of and has spent most of its days in a climate controlled studio. There are no paint chips, no rust and little signs of wear as pics show. There is some minor paint cracking on the backside as shown in pic.. hard to see but is there.on a good note, this is a tell tale sign that this truly is an original. The volume pot. Is a bit scratchy but plays fine. I could have replaced it but wanted to keep this insane shredder totally original.
