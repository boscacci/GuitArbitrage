{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Collings 290 Bill Collings is admittedly building some of the finest acoustic guitars that have ever been built. When he decided to take on the challenge of building electric guitars, this may have seemed an easier task. Electric guitars have no bracing, no acoustic waves to study, and acoustic players are known to be a finicky bunch when compared to our electric brethren. Well, 70 prototypes and a year later, he finally felt that he had built the electric guitar that he wanted to build. Redesigning electric guitars in the process and setting the new standard for fit, finish, innovation, and most importantly tone! The Collings 290 is named after the highway that runs through the Austin hill country and takes you to Collings workshop. It may look like a traditional model with it's one \"Spanish\" cutaway and two humbuckers. Look a little deeper and appreciate the features this guitar brings to the table. The Body is a select piece of mahogany that has two ergonomic cuts on the back of the guitar. One is for the area where the guitar rests against your ribcage and \"forms\" against it, and one on the lower bout to accommodate sitting down and playing the guitar. The leg cutout makes practicing or doing a session easy as it molds to your leg. The other makes standing and playing a gig a pleasure as the guitar fits comfortably against your body. The Neck joint has been redesigned to join the body on an angle allowing for easy access to the upper frets. The neck joins at the 17th fret on the bass side but on the treble side it joins at the 19th fret. The wood used is select Mahogany that was typically used on the great instruments of the 50's and 60's. This select wood has more mass, and therefore it is more rigid. However, it responds better than any guitar you have played. It is not in any way \"neck heavy.\" This Collings features twin Tom \"TV\" Jones Filter-tron Classic pickups, instead of the standard two humbuckers. TV Jones has been building such fine quality reproductions of Gretsch type pickupss. They started using his creations in all of their high end guitars. These pickups reproduce the look, feel, and tone of the classic 50's Gretsch guitars heard on many a Nashville session recording. This Guitar is in Very Good condition w/ light scratches throughout the pickguard and back plate, and some deeper scratches on the top (see pictures).
