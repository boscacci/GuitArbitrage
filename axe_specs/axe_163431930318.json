{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is my 1997 Epiphone Casino made in Korea. This is a nice guitar but I have to thin my collection. I have a problem if you know what I mean. This guitar is a second and is stamped used on the back of the headstock. It was ether a display guitar or it was stamped used because of the flaw in the finish on the face of the headstock, you can see it in the photos. Other than that this guitar is very clean for being almost 22 years old. There's a tiny ding on the binding but that's it. The bridge was updated with a roller bridge from Stewmac, and the tuners were replaced with Tone Pro's Kluson deluxe tuners. Original bridge, tuners and pickguard will come with the guitar. Comes with Epiphone OHSC. Ships to lower 48 only.", "ItemID": "163431930318", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T21:04:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T21:04:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-1997-Archtop-Casino-Electric-Guitar-made-Korea-/163431930318", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Soulsbyville, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634319303188080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/-joAAOSw8R9cFBZY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/IxwAAOSwXi9cFBZn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/69UAAOSwxL5cFBZw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/WvIAAOSwwSJcFBZ-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/~eAAAOSwG1JcFBaP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/p6sAAOSwcDdcFBag/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/V-oAAOSwckVcFBap/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "95372", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "april8160", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 226, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 43}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone 1997 Archtop Casino Electric Guitar made in Korea", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["ETCACHCH1"]}]}, "HitCount": 313, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 410.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78607581", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
