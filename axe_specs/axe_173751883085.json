{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Player Strat with Floyd Rose, Pau Ferro, Polar White - MIM Stratocaster. This color combo is not an offered that I am aware of. This is a 2018 Polar White Fender Player Stratocaster Floyd Rose HSS loaded body that I put a 2017 Pau Ferro Standard Stratocaster HSS With Floyd Rose neck on. Both are Fender made in Mexico. Story: Basically I wanted a maple neck Floyd model but couldn't find one for sale in 2017, Fender sold only Pau Ferro necks in 2017 - so I got an olympic white one with Pau Ferro. To get a maple neck for it I bought a 2018 strat with maple neck and swapped the necks. The 2017 body I had already customized and I like the olympic with the maple. So this is a sale of the polar white 2018 body with that 2017 Pau Ferro neck. Both guitars are registered to me, I posted a picture of my registration on the Fender site so you can see what models the loaded body and neck are from. I will unregister the serial of this one so the buyer can register it once they get it. The body still has the plastic on the covers, barely used at all. The neck and frets are in excellent condition. The body is a bright white, matches the white pick guard type white. Has brand new 46-10 hybrid slinky set of strings on it. These necks have the micro tilt necks but I didn't mess with it, it is how it came from factory. A few very small cosmetic blemishes, nothing really noticeable, but I am including as much detail as I can for full disclosure:The neck Pau Ferro coloring is a little darker near the nut, but that's how it was when I got it new from Sweetwater, so its just a Fender factory thing [see photo]. If you oil the fretboard it is no longer noticeable, but it shows as it dries out.The very tip of the neck also has a couple really tiny dings - so small I had to draw arrows on one of the photos to try to point them out.There is a very tiny dimple in the body paint. The paint is so white you can't notice it unless you put a reflection right on it, which I did for a photo and drew an arrow on it to point it out. I didn't even notice it was there until I scanned this guitar for any imperfections. It is not noticeable unless you're looking at it inches away and only if at the right angle.", "ItemID": "173751883085", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T00:03:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T18:38:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Player-Strat-Floyd-Rose-Pau-Ferro-Polar-White-MIM-Stratocaster-/173751883085", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cleveland, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737518830858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MDM=/z/CXoAAOSwmrNcQqqp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/U7YAAOSw7HhcQqqu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L-sAAOSwDgJcQqqt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c1oAAOSws2RcQqqt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tbUAAOSwrfRcQqqv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ldsAAOSw4ohcQqqu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JFsAAOSwqrZcQqqs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNTcx/z/5b8AAOSwip5cQqqu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODI4WDE2MDA=/z/dWcAAOSwuvFcUl2Y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "44129", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spaced216", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 217, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 437.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 437.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Player Strat with Floyd Rose, Pau Ferro, Polar White - MIM Stratocaster", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Player Strat W/Floyd Rose, Pau Ferro"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["1149403500"]}, {"Name": "Color", "Value": ["3-Color Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 366, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
