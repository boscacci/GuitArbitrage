{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Suhr style guitar I had custom built, but never play unfortunately as I already have 2 Suhrs. So, this one gets very little play time and is in fantastic condition. It has a one piece mahogany strat body with a single humbucker route. It has been oil finished with Tru-Oil and stain. The neck is an AMAZING, highly figured Suhr style beak Pau Ferro neck. It has 22 jumbo frets with no wear, and is basically in new condition. The inlays are brass as are the side dots and it looks fantastic. It is a medium C shape. It is simply stunning and was $800 alone. The pickup is a Suhr Doug Aldrich humbucker that just sings in this body! The tuners are brand new Sperzel locking tuners in satin black. The locking tremolo is a Gotoh floyd style locking trem just like Suhr uses. The guitar comes with a new universal hardshell case. This guitar is in great condition with no playability issues whatsoever. There is a very small area on the back of the headstock by the 5th tuner that cracked a little when the tuners were installed that cannot even be seen, and the neck pocket has a Stew Mac angled neck shim for better action on the neck. Otherwise its pristine. Thank you!", "ItemID": "153276912451", "EndTime": "2018-12-02T14:08:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-25T14:08:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-Guitar-Figured-Pau-Ferro-Beak-Neck-Suhr-Aldrich-Pickup-Gotoh-Sperzels-/153276912451", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Alabaster, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532769124518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE4WDE2MDA=/z/NEAAAOSwohJbkam7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/63YAAOSwvoNbkamn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTE4/z/gZ8AAOSwYLRbkam4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gfcAAOSwk6dbkanP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0NlgxNjAw/z/BPIAAOSwPSRbkamR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/BWsAAOSwlUhbkanC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYw/z/a0QAAOSw5S9bkamY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/xakAAOSwcMhbkamw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/S2UAAOSw8FtbkanL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WKcAAOSwSflbkame/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "35007", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gt9294", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 245, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 4}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom Guitar Figured Pau Ferro Beak Neck Suhr Aldrich Pickup Gotoh Sperzels", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Suhr"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}]}, "HitCount": 121, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
