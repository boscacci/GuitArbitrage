Lawsuit Era \"Open Book Head Stock\" ElectraMid 1970s Electra 2259 SG Style Electric GuitarMade In JapanOriginal FinishNo Repairs Includes the original case PLEASE DO NOT mistake picture glare for flaws.. YOUR SEEING CLOUDS FROM THE SKY.. If you think your seeing something not mentioned in this listing, please ask!!There are lots of pics, so when you receive it, its exactly what you expected, if not better. No surprises with this sale.. Buy with confidence!Here's The Run Down:This is a Mid 70s Electra 2259 Custom Lawsuit Era SG Style Guitar that sounds, looks and plays great! It is 45+/- years old, so there will be cosmetic flaws here and there, but still in great shape for its age. Flaws may consist of but not limited to marks, scuffs, scratches, dings and pick scratching on the guard from being played/handled, but nothing that would effect the integrity of the guitar (see pics). There is a minor neck pocket finish crack on one side as most end up having (pictured). There is some fret wear, but plays to my liking as it sits (see pics). There is some minor discoloration/corrosion of the hardware. I tried to take really good pics, so you can zoom in and judge its overall condition for yourself (see pics). There are NO repairs or changes other than the pickups ( not sure what they are). If your looking for a Super Cool, Early Japanese SG Style Guitar that your friends most likely don't have, this would make a great addition to your collection!This Electra 2259 Custom sounds and plays great! Although I think its set up great, everyone has their own preferences. If your not happy with its set up, it will be your responsibility and cost to have it set up to your liking. The neck is straight and the truss rod operates as it should. All electronics operate perfectly! The Included Original Case is used and vintage, but in good usable condition and fits the guitar properly . No issues other than one latch that is there, but does not latch. There will be flaws here and there from use, moving it around and age, but still a good original case. Everything operates as it should, and has never had, nor does it have any breaks or repairs unless noted above.Make sure you view all of the pics and ask questions if you have any concerns before buying.I will ship this item over seas, but you must contact me for a shipping quote before buying.
