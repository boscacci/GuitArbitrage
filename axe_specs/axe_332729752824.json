{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FOR SALE: One (1) Ibanez S520EX guitar in black, with original hard case.This thing plays great and is ridiculously light with a very thin neck, great for shredding. The guitar has been on tour and is \"well loved,\" in acceptable cosmetic condition with a few bumps I've shown in the pics. There are a lot of small indentations on the back of the neck from being bumped around, but they don't affect playability at all. There is a small crack running from the first fine tuner bolt about 2/3 of the way to the headstock (the intersecting line in the pic is just a dark line in the wood). To give you an idea of how worried you should be about this minor crack: it was present when I bought the guitar secondhand in 2005, and has not grown since that time. The ZR trem, Ibanez's version of a Floyd Rose, is awesome and stays in tune great even if you do a ton of huge dives, but you'll need to find your own trem arm as the original is long lost.
