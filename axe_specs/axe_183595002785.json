{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "It's time once again for my annual holiday guitar sale. Lot's of people look forward to this each year, so here we go. You are looking at an American made Fender USA Strat not Stratocaster electric guitar, that was made in 1989. This is a pretty rare model you don't see around often. Color is teal blue green with black hardware and Kahler tremolo. Body is in pretty decent shape, and would rate about 85-90%. The fretboard finish shows some wear from playing, as these were typically played by heavy metal users, and they really like to bend those strings. Tremolo bar and back plate are missing, but I will include a soft case for shipping. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a cool and collectible guitar, that is sure to keep going up in value. Each year I sell off the high end guitars that we have acquired at our pawn shop during the year, and they have been sold to almost every country in the world. We only sell quality products, and our feedback will back that up. All will be sold on a no reserve basis, and no auctions will be closed early or with a buy it now, so bid to buy. Thanks for looking, and please check out my other auctions too.", "ItemID": "183595002785", "EndTime": "2018-12-26T22:25:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T22:25:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1989-Fender-Strat-heavy-metal-version-teal-green-blue-rare-model-w-Kahler-/183595002785", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Riverside, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835950027858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/YwgAAOSwIw1cGsQE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/SQQAAOSwBkBcGsPu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/~pcAAOSwC45cGsPy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/igoAAOSwM5tcGsQD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/eXAAAOSwCNlcGsQE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/uoUAAOSw5qdcGsP4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/MN8AAOSwyPFcGsP0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/ieUAAOSwpFtcGsPz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/JxcAAOSwdgxcGsP3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/67oAAOSwdHpcGsQF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/38kAAOSw7OdcGsQU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/VtoAAOSwQZVcGsP4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92506", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "inlandjandl", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 691, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 17, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 563.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 563.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 188}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1989 Fender Strat heavy metal version in teal green / blue, rare model w/Kahler\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["strat"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 585, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 573.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
