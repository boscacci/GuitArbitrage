{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a very rare electric guitar handmade by former Mosrite head luthier Bill Gruggett in Bakersfield, CA. The quality is fantastic, and it has a number of very unique design features. This uses neck-through construction and has a brass rail set through the body and fretboard. There is no truss rod with this type of construction, and it gives the guitar a unique sound and tons of sustain. This guitar features three wood covered pickups which were handmade for this guitar. They are controlled with two volumes, a master tone, and three, 3-way switches. The pickups all sound fantastic, and you can get a very wide range of usable tones with this guitar. This has good quality Grover tuners. The bridge looks similar to a Schaller 456, but is actually a rare badass bridge by Leo Quan. It has fine tuners. The electronics all work properly and a free of noise or problems. One switch is missing the nut and the tip is broken off. The switch itself still functions. All of the hardware works perfectly, and is free of corrosion and damage. The neck is perfectly straight and the frets have no significant wear. This guitar plays phenomenally well with low action. The finish on the fretboard is a bit cloudy, and is starting to peel and chip in places. The worst area is a section of missing clearcoat in the center of the 11th fret. This is similar to the type of chipping you often see on vintage Fender guitars with maple fretboards. The age yellowing on the fretboard has obscured the beautiful brass rail a bit. This would really look amazing if the fretboard was refinished. There are cracks on both sides of the neck right below the nut (see photos). These can barely be felt when you run your hand over them. The headstock is tight and seems to be structurally sound. The headstock doesn't wiggle or move (with or without strings), and the cracks don't seem to be too deep. Examining them under magnification, I think it's possible they were previously repaired. In any event, they do not seem to be a structural issue. If I were keeping this, I'd probably have a luthier take a look at them and refinish the fretboard. This comes with the original case. Buyer pays $60.00 shipping in the US.
