{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a 2010 Paul Reed Smith 305. I am not the original owner, and I had this guitar setup professionally directly at the PRS Tech Center ($150). It is setup perfectly and plays as you would expect from any PRS. I have gigged about 30 times over 2 years and it sounds great and is an extremely reliable instrument. In full disclosure, I am making sure the potential buyer is aware of two small blemishes on the finish. These were on the guitar when I purchased it. A small impression dent on the body just below the bridge, not through the finish, and another small scratch on the bottom. I've taken a photo of both and have a standard Jim Dunlop pick next to each blemish for reference. The rest of the guitar is clean, including the neck. Included along with the PRS hard shell case will be the tremolo arm, allen wrench for the tremolo arm, original hang tag and other case candy from PRS.", "ItemID": "173635962003", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T01:53:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T01:53:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2010-Paul-Reed-Smith-PRS-305-Electric-Guitar-Frost-Blue-Metallic-/173635962003", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "West Grove, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736359620038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HDUAAOSw3ANb6NdP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDU0/z/hxEAAOSwCgVb6NdR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMzgw/z/p4IAAOSw4xpb6NdQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/SL0AAOSw21Rb6NdQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MzY=/z/JfwAAOSw4jxb6NdP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTE=/z/7EMAAOSwIw1b6NdQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTUy/z/tMgAAOSwK65b6NdR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WSQAAOSw~llb6NdP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lHIAAOSwfMlb6NdP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "19390", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pickchop", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 58, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 232}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2010 Paul Reed Smith PRS 305 Electric Guitar - Frost Blue Metallic", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 328, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
