{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Les Paul Custom Lite 2013 Ebony Black Beauty with Papers & Case This is a discontinued model made in 2013 in limited numbers. I think they only made this model in 2013 and 2014. Comes with original Gibson case and paperwork. The neck is strait. the action low, strung with 10's currently, it plays super easy. This was made to be a lighter version of the Les Paul Custom Black Beauty. The body width is similar to an SG and it has a small tummy cut on the back. Binding is beautiful and this looks dead on to a Les Paul Custom from the front view except for one tone knob is a switch for coil taps. I was going to add the 4th knob with a standard push pull coil tap. I don't know why Gibson did not do that?? All original except for the strap locks, I have the original strap buttons in the case. The guitar has some very minor finish wear here and there, some light button scratches on the back, but overall in excellent + condition. This model Les Paul is getting harder to find in this condition due to the limited numbers produced. Prices on the used market for this model are slowly increasing every year. From Gibson Web site:Here is a nice one for the people who like the LP Custom but not its weight. This one has a thinner body. In crafting the Les Paul Custom Lite, Gibson USA starts with time-tested ingredients, including the legendary tonewood pairing of a carved maple top and genuine mahogany body, the latter treated with Gibson\u2019s traditional weight relief to reduce the load and enhance resonance. The quarter-sawn mahogany neck is carved to a rounded \u201950s profile and topped with a Grade-A, rosewood fingerboard with single-ply binding and classic acrylic block inlays. The body and headstock are trimmed in multi-ply binding, and the headstock carries an Acrylic Gibson logo and traditional acrylic split-diamond inlay. Dressed entirely in high-gloss Ebony Black, in genuine nitrocellulose lacquer, the Les Paul Custom Lite simply oozes class from every angle. The beauty of this gorgeous black Les Paul Custom Lite is more than skin deep, and Gibson USA has also packed added versatility into the traditional formula. Two of Gibson\u2019s most popular humbucking pickups from the Modern Classics series offer all the tone that made the Les Paul legendary in the first place, plus added single-coil sounds thanks to the coil-splitting mini-toggle switch added in place of the second tone control. The 490R in the neck position is made with a genuine Alnico II magnet and wound with 42 AWG wire in the image of the original PAF humbuckers, for plenty of depth and warmth with impressive articulation. The 498T in the bridge position has an Alnico V magnet and extra turns of coil wire for added punch and growl. A traditional Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece enhance the sustain that has long made the Les Paul legendary, and a set of Grover\u2122 keystone tuners\u2014all in gold, as are the pickup covers and strap buttons\u2014ensure a lifetime of smooth tuning.
