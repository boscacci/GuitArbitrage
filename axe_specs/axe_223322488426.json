{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at what has to be one of the rarer guitars that Cort has made. This is a Jerry Auerswald designed model, and I really don't know much about it because there seems to be absolutely no information out there about this guitar. I bought it because I was so intrigued by a model that I had never seen. I was told that this guitar was purchased from an employee of Cort Guitars, I believe a sales rep? I don't even know if this was an actual model that even went into production. It does have a serial number on the back of the neck, and it shows that it was made in Korea. If it was a production model, it must have been extremely limited. Jerry Auerswald designed and built guitars for Prince, which probably explains the unique design of this guitar. It is in very nice shape, it does have some play wear, but that would be consistent with it being shown to customers by a sales rep. It is extremely comfortable to play, the body has a fantastic contoured shape to it. The neck is thin, flat and fast, very similar in my opinion to an Ibanez RG. The action is set nice and low, and plays very smooth. It has a 5-way switch, chrome speed knobs for the volume and tone controls, non-locking tuners, and unknown manufacturer of the electronics, I haven't taken the guitar apart to look at them, and I am not going to. I would assume that they are stock Cort electronics, but again, I don't know what would have been put in a guitar being shown to prospective buyers of the guitar. The picture of the headstock has a reflection from a light fixture on it that makes it look like it has a scratch or crack, it does not, it is simply a reflection. I do not have a case for the guitar, but it will be packaged very safe and secure. I will ship in the US only. You can ask questions, but I don't know that I can share anything else about it, I simply can't find any info on this guitar. What I know is that it is unique, in very nice shape, very comfortable, and it plays great. I do not have the tremolo bar for the bridge.", "ItemID": "223322488426", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T18:19:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T18:19:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Cort-Jerry-Auerswald-designed-electric-guitar-rare-oddity-Prince-/223322488426", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Oregon, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233224884268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/fZoAAOSw29JcMOo1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/eDoAAOSwgzBcMOo4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/0-UAAOSwmE9cMOo6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/LSAAAOSwhrpcMOo8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ceIAAOSwoZJcMOo~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/WKkAAOSwMg5cMOpB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/AXYAAOSwXyBcMOpD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/3cUAAOSw5EpcMOpF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/dVgAAOSwFx5cMOpI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7uQAAOSwGIZcMOpK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53575", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jazztrax", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 711, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 913}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Cort Jerry Auerswald designed electric guitar, rare oddity, Prince.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Cort"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Jerry Auerswald Designed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 230, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 201.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
