Fender Jimi Hendrix Stratocaster Honoring the electrifying \u201cVoodoo Chile\u201d who popularized the Stratocaster guitar and its tremendous sonic flexibility, the Jimi Hendrix Stratocaster gives you the same fiery tone and playing feel to wield as your own. Full of incendiary vintage tone and classic style, this extraordinary instrument features signature touches and unique appointments based on his distinctive \u201cflipped-over\u201d guitars.The foundation of Hendrix\u2019s uniquely personal sound and playing style was his habit of flipping his guitars over and restringing them to accommodate his left-handed playing, resulting in a \u201creverse\u201d headstock and bridge pickup\u2014features reproduced here in exacting detail. The \u201creverse\u201d headstock produces a longer string length for the bass strings, creating a tighter playing feel along with easier bending and vibrato on the treble strings. A trio of unsurpassed American Vintage \u201965 single-coil pickups includes a reverse-slant bridge pickup, producing uniquely inspiring tone with tight, warm sound and enhanced upper harmonics and definition. The highly versatile 9.5\u201d-radius \u201cC\u201d-shaped maple neck with medium jumbo frets offers a flatter playing surface\u2014ideal for chording while simultaneously allowing you to bend notes to the stratosphere without fear of fretting out during scorching solos.Commemorating Hendrix\u2019s unrivaled legacy, the large \u201970s-style headstock bears the guitarist\u2019s signature on the rear. A unique neck plate displays a shoulders-up silhouette of the man himself and the engraved inscription, \u201cAuthentic Hendrix,\u201d leaving no doubt as to the inspiration behind this guitar.
