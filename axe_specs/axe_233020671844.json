{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I bought this guitar in July of 2018 and have played it very lightly off and on until October 2018 when I acquired a new guitar. It is in very good condition, the only light marks you'll see are on the pickguard from strumming and on the very top of the headstock, from bumping into my door once (shown in one of the pictures). All parts are stock, even strings. Other than that there are no issues. With the guitar, I will include the tremolo arm, a tremolo spring for under the arm (these springs are usually only included in American Strats), a strap, and a Tortex 88mm pick. I'd also like to add that I do not smoke, nor has the guitar been exposed to it. Please contact me if you have any questions!
