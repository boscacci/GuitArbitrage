{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Beautiful, honey burst relic tele up for grabs. Ash body that has been relic'd but with a thin coat of clear to preserve the job. Neck, also hand relicd has been professionally set up with 10s and plays like butter. Incredibly smooth and fast. So here's the rundown this is all I know about the guitar: I bought this guitar a few months ago from someone on Reverb, and this is the info he gave me on the guitar... \"I purchased the body with the custom pick guard and electronics from a guitar shop here in Houston. Then, I bought an all parts American neck that was relic'd by Indy guitars in Indianapolis. Once I received the neck, I had it installed and set up by the guy who sold me the body. So it's basically a partscaster Tele, made with all American pieces. And that's really all I know. It's a great guitar I just bought a new one and want to cover the costs. Equipped with a set of Rio Grande pups, Neck- Baby BBQ mini humbucker $160 Bridge - Tele shortthorn $110 Ill throw in a really great case as well.", "ItemID": "113409838758", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T00:00:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-29T15:24:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Standard-Telecaster-Honey-Burst-Relic-/113409838758", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Monsey, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134098387588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g6IAAOSwyApcAAQn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nbQAAOSwqnVcAAQp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1T8AAOSwbbJcAAQn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eckAAOSwE9pcAAQp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pMMAAOSwPuRcAAQp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xh4AAOSwWIJcAAQn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "10952", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ylevin_0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 6, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 119}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Standard Telecaster Honey Burst Relic", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Ash"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["145102302", "145102306", "145102309", "145102375", "145102502"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["145102302"]}]}, "HitCount": 362, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78630669", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
