Its three-piece mahogany neck is shaped to deliver comfortable, effortless play with an ebony fingerboard and 22 medium-jumbo frets. The semi-hollow maple body features a striking black and white tattoo graphic by famed British artist Kev Grey and is fixed with two Duncan Designed humbuckers (with coil splitting) that whisper and wail with plenty of firepower. The Bigsby B-70 vibrato gives you extra expression while rock-solid Gotoh tuners keep you in tune. This guitar is in excellent condition. It is \"like new\" with little-to-no playwear.
