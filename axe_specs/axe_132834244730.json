It feels like a much more expensive guitar. I'm only selling it because I usually reach for my acoustic guitar when I play. Serial Number: MN580351 Production Number: 80351 Made at the Fender Ensenada Plant in Mexico between 1995 - 1996 The original tuners were upgraded to a set of Fender Polished Chrome Locking Tuners (model 990818100 - a $55 value) which greatly improved the ability to tune the guitar (keys turn smoothly) and the amount of time the tune lasts (it holds tune even after months of not playing). Included: A 1995-1996 Mexican Fender Stratocaster Electric Guitar And a Hard Case Also included: One set of D'Addario XL Nickel Wound Jazz Medium Gauge Strings - 13's (as seen in the photos) Two sets of D'Addario XL Nickel Wound Light Gauge Strings - 10's (as seen in the photos) Two sets of DR DDT-11 Drop-Down Tuning strings - 11's (as seen in the photos) One patch cable (to hook up to your amp - as seen in the photos) One Snark Guitar Tuner (SN-5) (as seen in the photos) And a few picks to get you started (as seen in the photos) BONUS INCLUDED: Vox amPlug Metal Guitar Headphone Amp - a $45 value! (Pictured in the photos.) The headphone amp is a mini-amp that plugs right into the guitar. Plug your headphones into the Vox and jam away with gain, tone, and volume settings just like on the real amp!! Sounds amazing -- just like the real thing -- and is perfect when you don't want to disturb anyone around you!! Features of the Vox amPlug Metal Guitar Headphone Amp include: AUX in jack lets you jam along with your CD/MP3 player. 100% analog circuit faithfully simulates the response of the original amps. Gain, Tone, and Volume knobs to adjust the output. ON/Standby switch to toggle the device on or in standby mode. NOTE: the guitar stand is NOT included in the bundle and is only shown in the photos for displaying the guitar. The guitar alone is worth $425, the locking tuners $55, the strings $50, the tuner $10, and the Vox $45...a $585 value. PLUS YOU GET FREE SHIPPING... you can't beat it. Great package for seasoned players and beginners alike! Additional details: The guitar was well taken care of. It is in great condition. I brought into the shop for regular tune-ups. Various technicians cleaned/repaired electronic components over the years to improve the sound (has noticably less static/feedback than it originally had). As seen in the photos, I kept the original tag that came with it when I bought it back in the 90's. Also has a bumper sticker that I never used. I've had this set up over the years with various gauge strings from 10's to 13's (nut has been cut to accept 13's). All has sounded great and it has been VERY playable regardless of the gauge used. I believe I have 10's on there now. Whenever I have changed the gauge, I am sure to bring it into the shop to get it correctly set up. NOTE: One minor ding in the side of the body. One small blemish on the fretboard (both pictured in photos). Two small holes left in pick guard from removal of GK-3 Midi pickup (also pictured in photos). NOTE: Some of the latches on the hard case are bent but it latches well enough to close and carry around without worry of opening. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
