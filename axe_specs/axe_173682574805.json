{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 2017 Fender Jazzmaster Traditional 60s electric guitar in showroom clean, near mint condition and perfect working order. Complete with the original hangtags and Fender-branded hardshell case, this model was made exclusively for the domestic Japanese market and not intended for export, so it's quite uncommon outside its country of origin. The features of this Jazzmaster are associated with a model from 1964, with dot inlay on the thick veneer rosewood fretboard, a \"Spaghetti\" logo, and witch hat knobs. A textbook example of everything we love about the Jazzmaster, the instrument has plenty of twang and sparkle on tap, with a range of powerful and defined tones from the two single coil pickups, and warm, wooly sounds when switched to the rhythm circuit on the guitar's lower body horn. The guitar weighs in at 8lbs 8oz and balances well on a strap. Setup to perfection here at Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar where we specialize in Fender Offset instruments, this Jazzmaster is dialed in and ready for the stage and studio with 10-46 strings.The vintage amber tinted maple neck has a comfortable slender C shaped profile with a smooth gloss finish and a fast, effortless feel. The nut measures just a hair under 1 11/16\" in width, and the rosewood fretboard has flawless fretwire. The scale length is a full 25 1/2\", and the fretboard has a vintage Fender spec 7 1/4\" radius. The headstock sports a Pre-CBS style \"Spaghetti\" Jazzmaster logo, with Kluson-style tuning machines which turn smoothly and hold pitch well.All of the electronics work as they should, and the wiring and pickups are stock. The vibrato unit works smoothly, and engages easily for quick warbles and surfy dives. The gloss white finish, tortoise shell pickguard, and white plastic parts are in exceptional shape, with virtually no wear. The \"Made in Japan\" designation and \"JD17\" prefix serial number are present at the heel of the neck just above the neck plate as well.This Traditional '60s Jazzmaster is as clean as they come and complete with the original hangtags and Fender-branded hardshell case***We are dealers for the Mastery M1 bridge, Offset Vibrato, and Lollar Jazzmaster pickups, any or all of which can be installed prior to shipment for an additional charge*** Check out our shop \"Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar,\" and please let us know if we can answer any questions!
