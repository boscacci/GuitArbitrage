{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I TOOK THIS IN AS TRADE FOR A GUITAR I BUILT ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO. IT IS A LIKE NEW MK3 VILLIAN BC RICH. IT HAS A SOLID WOOD BODY (NOT SURE WHAT IT IS) WITH A GORGEOUS FLAMED MAPLE TOP. ITS FINISHED IN A FANTSTIC GLOSS TRANSPARENT CHERRY. THE BODY IS IN NEAR PERFECT CONDITION. I DONT WANT TO SAY PERFECT AS IT WAS PLAYED SOME. IT HAS THE BC RICH LICENSED FLOYD ROSE THAT WORKS GREAT. IT HAS A MAPLE NECK WITH R. WOOD FRETBOARD WITH 24 JUMBO FRETS. THERE IS ESSENTIALLY ZERO FRET WEAR. I DONT WANT TO SAY ZERO BECAUSE IT WAS PLAYED A LITTLE. THE ORIGINAL HUMBUCKERS WERE REMOVED. THEY WERE GARBAGE, MUDDY WITH NO DEFINITION AT ALL. THEY WERE REPLACED WITH A NEW SET OF X2N STYLE BLADE HUMBUCKERS. THESE ARE WOUND TO THE SAME SPECS AS THE DIMARZIO X2N SET. BUT THESE HAVE A LITTLE LESS SHRILL HIGHS AND UPPER MIDS. THEY STILL HAVE THE HUGE BOTTOM END AND NATURAL MID SCOOP. THEY ARE RUN THROUGH A 3 WAY TOGGLE SWITCH, MASTER VOLUME AND MASTER TONE. I REPLACED THE CHEAP 50 CENT STOCK SWITCH. THE TONE POT IS A NEW PUSH PULL POT THAT WILL SPLIT THE HUMBUCKERS INTO SINGLE COILS. I REPLACED THE CHEAP TONE CAP WITH A VINTAGE GE .047 CAP. IT HELPS TO FURTHER TAME THE HIGHS. THE PICKUPS SOUND GREAT IN CLEAN, ESPECIALLY IN SINGLE COIL MODE. BUT THEY LONG TO BE DRIVEN HARD. THIS THING IS A HEAVY METAL DREAM WITH VERSATILITY. ULTIMATELY, I AM NOT A FLOYD ROSE PLAYER. I WILL TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SHIPPING IS TO THE CONT. US ONLY. I WILL ONLY SHIP INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH EBAYS GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. PLEASE MAKE PAYMENT OR CONTACT WITH ME WITHIN 72 HOURS. THANKS AND GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.", "ItemID": "123551929525", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T15:34:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T15:34:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/UPGRADED-BC-RICH-MK3-VILLIAN-TRANSPARENT-CHERRY-FLAMED-MAPLE-FLOYD-ROSE-MINT-/123551929525", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Paris, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235519295258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VKoAAOSw~flb~BJB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UqUAAOSwcdxb~BJX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/S~MAAOSwYd5b~BJN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wbUAAOSwzZNb~BJL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9BgAAOSwHF1b~BJV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BHYAAOSwVcZb~BJS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MG4AAOSwxgNb~BJP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GWsAAOSwqlxb~BJR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "40361", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "michaelh571", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2983, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.7, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 28}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "UPGRADED BC RICH MK3 VILLIAN TRANSPARENT CHERRY FLAMED MAPLE FLOYD ROSE MINT", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["B.C.
