{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2013 Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Black finish, alder body, maple neck and fretboard, non-locking tremolo. Original pickups/pickguard not included. Weight is 8 pounds and 2 ounces. Pickups are now all DiMarzio: Super Distortion in bridge, HS-3 (hum-cancelling Strat) middle, and PAF 36th Anniversary in neck. Original boxes for pickups will be included. All pickups, switches, and controls work 100%. Currently strung with with Ernie Ball slinky 9-46 gauge, and will include an extra set of strings. Action somewhat low, will ship with strings de-tuned to decrease tension on neck while in transit - therefore, guitar may need adjusting to meet your preferences! A 2nd string tree was added (by me) for D/G strings- this helped eliminate the harmonic ringing Fenders can have when you quickly play and then mute open chords on these strings. Original hardshell case and case candy (rag, finish polish, all original bags, tags, allen keys, case keys, receipt, warrant cards, owner's manual, patch cable, etc) included. See condition description for lots of details. Guitar is in used, but very good condition. Minor wear, no major defects or blemishes of any kind. Played little, smoke-free home. ***Guitar closely resembles a Dave Murray signature model but is NOT an actual, official Dave Murray signature.

If you cannot pay within this time-frame, I reserve the right to offer the guitar to the next-highest bidder or re-list it.", "ItemID": "173699722921", "EndTime": "2018-12-27T02:49:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-20T02:49:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2013-Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Black-Ebony-HSH-case-candy-/173699722921", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736997229218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RegAAOSwuUlcFwoJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TfAAAOSwkQhcFwnv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tF4AAOSw7wFcFwkM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/01kAAOSwKdpcFwoV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X4wAAOSw6jJcFwop/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7wYAAOSwolpcFwo0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FJ0AAOSwfTlcFwo~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YBwAAOSwmvpcFwpU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XS0AAOSwWIJcFwpc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bcAAAOSw~vNcFwpl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yfoAAOSwwkRcFwm4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iK0AAOSwcnZcFwpw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "46201", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ibuystuffsometimes", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 83, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 63, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 711.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 711.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 338}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2013 Fender American Standard Stratocaster Black/Ebony HSH with case candy", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 938, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 721.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used, very good condition. No missing paint, chips, or dents in the finish. There are general wear marks, slight scuffs and scratches, and a little buckle rash. All wear is minor, and nothing penetrates the finish. Can't really be noticed unless you look closely or have direct light. Frets have minimal wear, lots of years left in them. Guitar has not been played a lot and was never toured/gigged. Stored in cool, smoke-free home. All controls and pickups work 100%. Case is in very good condition. A nick or two, few scuffs and rub marks. Right side spring-loaded latch closes and locks, but when released, does not fly up under spring pressure- it simply releases.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
