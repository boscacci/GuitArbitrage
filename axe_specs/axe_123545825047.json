{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a 2001 Epiphone E-Series Xplorer Beast. It was made in Korea by Samick. This was from a line of Guitars only made in 2001-2002. These Guitars were geared towards Metal. This has High output humbuckers, 22 medium jumbo Frets, Rosewood fretboard, sealed Jin-Ho (Wilkinson) Tuners, Tune-O-Matic Bridge, and a string through body. It is in excellent condition, with one indentation by the Volume Pot, and a small chip on one of the points. (Very small). It has a few light rubs and marks in the clear coat, but you have to search for them to notice. This guitar has been completely taken apart, cleaned, restrung, and tuned. It has a brand new set of Boomer 9\u2019s on it. The neck is straight, the truss rod works, and the Frets have very little wear. These are rare Guitars, and are built to shred. As soon as I got it tuned I busted out some Metallica, Seek And Destroy, and it sounded awesome. The neck is a Slim Taper, and is built for speed. The stand in the pics isn\u2019t included, and there is no case. It will be expertly packed and shipped with insurance.", "ItemID": "123545825047", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T14:21:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-15T15:45:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-E-Series-Xplorer-Beast-2001-Red-Near-Mint-Made-Korea-Just-Tuned-Up-/123545825047", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Grand Prairie, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235458250478080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Uc4AAOSwZMZa7HRi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NNgAAOSw5IFa7HRw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Q58AAOSw7fBa7HR-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yQkAAOSwIzBa2BkB/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z6wAAOSwIM9a7HSM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2EoAAOSwrT1a7HSX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lz4AAOSwE3ha7HSj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fB4AAOSw4Epa7HSu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d9IAAOSwWhVa2BkZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kXMAAOSwzFVa2Bkc/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/s0MAAOSwOAda7HTB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cUEAAOSwetxa7HTU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "75050", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "scottyrock44", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 630, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***-", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone E-Series Xplorer Beast 2001 Red Near Mint Made In Korea Just Tuned Up!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Xplorer Beast"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Epiphone E-Series"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 44, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=88516280", "StoreName": "GPCycleParts"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money back or replacement (buyer's choice)", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar is in excellent condition.
