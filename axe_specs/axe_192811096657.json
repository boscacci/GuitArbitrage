{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Explorer E/2 . Condition is Used. Shipped with USPS Parcel Select Ground. I purchased this guitar new sometime in the early 1980's from a local music store. It was my first great guitar. Great action, great sounds! But I must part with it now. I am downsizing and moving on. The guitar is in great condition. One owner, me. No road wear whatsoever. There are some light scratches on the back but nothing serious. The front pickup failed years ago and was replaced by local guitar tech Dick Boyd. The result is a warm creamy sound, very jazz like. I am not sure what Mr. Boyd replaced it with but it sure sounds good to me. I am sure you will enjoy having this in your guitar arsenal. A heavy guitar for heavy music! Your guitar will ship in its original Gibson hard-shell case.", "ItemID": "192811096657", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T06:41:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T04:37:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Explorer-E-2-/192811096657", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cantonment, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1928110966578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ll8AAOSw5tNcU8Rp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/rU4AAOSwM5tcU8SQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/a0kAAOSw5wJcU8Sr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/WIsAAOSw-iZcU8TM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/VesAAOSws~VcU8To/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/tVAAAOSwQSlcU8UM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/mk0AAOSwAThcU8Ul/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32533", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "seventiessorcery", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2144, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1563.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1563.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 187}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Explorer E/2 ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}]}, "HitCount": 20, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1588.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
