{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage 70's Crestline LP Copy, Made in Japan during the heyday of the lawsuit era! This is one of those high quality copies that looks, plays and sounds like a particular Famous Maker model that was being produced during the same era of it's manufacture. It has beautiful wood that looks to be possibly mahogany? It's in great shape for it's age, looks like it spent most of it's time in it's case in a closet but does have a little wear visible from normal use. Please look at all of the pictures closely. All original electronics, everything works nicely, working truss rod, neck is nice and straight with just a touch of noticeable fretwear on the first few frets. It has been nicely detailed and set up with a fresh set of .010's. Looks and plays great! Comes with it's original les paul style hardcase pictured which has heavy exterior wear. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
