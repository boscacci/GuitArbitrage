{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Incredible guitar. Sounds and plays phenomenal. Absolutely custom shop quality. It is an incredibly \"live\" guitar. When you strum it it vibrates like crazy! You can tell they really have built these right. This guitar has no cosmetic issues. It is basically like new. The protective plastic is still on the pick guard and control cavity plate. Here's a link to the Epiphone page for the guitar that has videos of Joe Bonamassa playing one and A/B-ing with his vintage Firebird. it is amazing how close they are http://www.epiphone.com/News/Features/2016/Epiphone-Ltd-Ed-Joe-Bonamassa-Treasure-Firebird-I.aspx It also comes with an Epiphone hardshell case in addition to the signature gig bag, hand-signed COA and all case candy. According to Epiphone... _______________________ A \"Treasured\" Vintage Firebird Reborn: The new Epiphone Ltd. Ed. Joe Bonamassa \"Treasure\" Firebird-I Outfit was closely modeled after Joe's original 1963 Firebird. Joe worked closely with Epiphone's legendary luthiers in Nashville, Tennessee to recreate his rare single pickup Firebird that was made in the first year of the guitar's production at the Epiphone & Gibson factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan. And according to Joe, the new Epiphone \"Treasure\" Firebird-I far exceeded his expectations. \"The guitar is called 'Treasure' as it's based on the '63 Firebird that was graciously gifted to me 4 years ago,\" said Bonamassa. \"We A/B'd the new Epiphone with my two original 63s. The Epi's play and sound better! Ugh... I just paid $12,000 for one!\" Reverse Firebird\u2122 body shape Original Thru-Neck Construction The new Epiphone Ltd. Ed. Joe Bonamassa \"Treasure\" Firebird-I Outfit features a Mahogany body with a 9-piece Laminated Mahogany/Walnut neck with a period-correct early 1960s Rounded \"C\" profile measured after Joe's original. Epiphone improved on the vintage neck design by including a dual action adjustable truss rod. The Firebird was the first electric guitar to feature \"thru-neck\" construction along with the iconic Reverse Firebird\u2122 body shape. The neck has a Rosewood fingerboard with a 14\" radius, 22 medium jumbo frets, classic \"Dot\" inlays, and a 24.75\" scale length. The \"Treasure\" Firebird-I comes in two color finishes, a classic Tobacco Sunburst and Polymist Gold exclusive to Joe's Signature Firebird. The historic-styled white and black-layered pickguard has the classic \"Firebird\" logo. A premium custom gigbag is included. ________________________________ Note that this is a LONG guitar and the case is big. It will require a big box to ship. I had two of these and when I sold the other, I had to send the gig bag sepatrately. If so, I'll ship the gig bag for free, but buyer pays for shipping of the guitar and hard case. Regardlss, it will likely be a little more expensive than normal guitar shipping costs.\u2028 It is an awesome guitar and I wish I could keep it. Alas, we can't keep them all.
