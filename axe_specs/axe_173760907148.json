{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This beautiful guitar is used and in excellent condition. It has a transparent blue finish. It is a Johnson by AXL it has a tele. style body, maple neck with rosewood fretboard.It has a couple of minor marks from normal wear and tear and is missing the plastic tip on the toggle switch. This does not affect functionality. All in all, I would take this one over a NEW one and here's why. I have been playing for 40 years.ALL GUITARS require being set up. This does not mean just \"tunning\" the instrument. In fact, before you can properly tune a guitar one needs to set a few other parameters on the instrument. The neck can be adjusted flat or with more of a bow. I like a flat neck but depending on the instrument I may need to set a little more relief so there is no buzzing or dead spots. Then you can set your string hight and pick-up distance. Then you can set the intonation by adjusting the string length on the bridge. Then when you tune the guitar there are no sharp or flat frets. I took the TIME to roll the edges of the frets on this one. Feels nice and smooth now. New, they can feel like cheese graters.So, that's a lot. Most will just pay a luthier to do it for them. That's fine.What I'm offering here is really more than a guitar. I have gone through all that on MANY, MANY guitars. I can tell you they are not all created equal. Sometimes it will pay off and make a big difference in how the guitar sounds and plays. Sometimes not so much. This guitar \"cleaned\" up nicely.I like to keep a couple guitars around so I don't have to pull one of my more expensive guitars out of it's case just to strum around for 10 or 15 minuets.I have been doing this for some time now. I have about three beginner guitars that I put in this class of BETTER than average players and keep them for myself. I have decided to make this one available for a very reasonable price.Weather you're a beginner or a more advanced player this guitar could be a nice fit.This listing is for just the guitar. NO case, cords, straps, or other accessories. Just the guitar.Local pick up available. I reserve the right to end this auction for any reason. Item is available for sale locally.Please see photos and ask any questions.All offers welcome.
