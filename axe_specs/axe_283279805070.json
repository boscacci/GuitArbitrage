{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Godin Exit 22 24.75 scale two Single coils and a quality Full Humbucker PUs 5 position switch a well rounded solid guitar allowing for an wide spectrum of sounds. This particular guitar is in really good condition not quite excellent. Everything works great. The neck is like new. No Fret wear nor any of those little annoying pea dents on the back nor headstock dings. Body has a few little playing area scuffs and back just a bit of belt rash. All the bouts are good and just a few soft dents on edging. Pots don't scratch and the ALL Pickups play great. I believe are std. issue? I'm NOT org owner. Set up is good, but NOT real low it's for Rock or blues string bending. It's a heavier than strat guitar but not Les Paul weight. I'm guessing just over 7 lbs?See Specs:Combines a 24-3/4' scale with a 22-fret neck.With the neck bolted deeper into the the body by an extra-fret, you get a bigger sound on the Godin Exit 22 while retaining an extremely comfortable feel and balance thanks to the short scale and sculpted, heelless neck joint. Monstrous distortion tones are easily dialed in via the bridge-position humbucker and stinging clean sounds are at your fingertips thanks to the single-coils in the neck and middle position. The electric guitar's solid mahogany body and rock maple neck have a semi-gloss finish for a sleek feel.
