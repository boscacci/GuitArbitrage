{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Welcome to our Auction! You are looking at a Samick Electric Guitar with Gig Bag! Not sure about the year or model but it functions as it should. The neck is comfortable and feels good on a strap. This appears to be kind of rare. We looked all over to find the model but didn't. If you guys know the model, feel free to let us know.Overall condition is Very Good and you can expect to find normal signs of wear and tear but it has not been abused.Includes very nice gig bag and trem bar so the only thing you'll need to bring is your creativity. When you buy from me, expect to receive what you see in the pics. I know the feeling of buying something sight unseen only to find out the seller was not that accurate. I have been selling on Ebay for more than a decade and I am only happy when you are happy! Buyer has 24 hours to contact me and 3 days to complete payment transaction. If this criteria is not met, the item will be sold to someone else. Please keep in mind with shipping, when you buy a guitar from me, you are not just paying for shipping. You are paying for my time and experience in packaging delicate items, as well as the cost of new boxes and shipping peanuts. Thanks. Please email me with any questions and good luck in bidding! International Buyers are responsible for paying all duties and taxes. If you are not sure about how much they will be, please contact your local customs office and find out before you make a purchase, thank you!", "ItemID": "333048763162", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T17:31:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T17:29:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samick-Electric-Guitar-Bag-/333048763162", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pompano Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330487631628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/w90AAOSwnWpcBfHs/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2RUAAOSwIABcBfHt/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4BYAAOSwZNtcBfHx/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iCgAAOSw~4BcBfHz/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NQ4AAOSwo1lcBfH1/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dPsAAOSwY0ZcBfH5/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oSoAAOSwzaJcBfH8/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nrAAAOSwabRcBfH-/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UvAAAOSwsQJcBfIF/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1XUAAOSwLr1cBfII/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3okAAOSwQH5cBfIM/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jxUAAOSw7rlcBfId/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33065", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spinesplitter", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1614, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 147}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Samick Electric Guitar with Bag!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Samick"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 3, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=11691455", "StoreName": "Hear For Music"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
