Description from Gibson Made with a considerably thinner body and traditional weight relief, this limited-edition Les Paul Classic Custom Lite lightens the load for a superbly playable Custom that still packs all the elegant looks and dual-humbucker tone that has made the Les Paul legendary. In crafting the Les Paul Custom Lite, Gibson USA starts with time-tested ingredients, including the legendary tonewood pairing of a carved maple top and genuine mahogany body, the latter treated with Gibson\u2019s traditional weight relief to reduce the load and enhance resonance. The quarter-sawn mahogany neck is carved to a rounded \u201950s profile and topped with a Grade-A, rosewood fingerboard with single-ply binding and classic acrylic block inlays. The body and headstock are trimmed in multi-ply binding, and the headstock carries an Acrylic Gibson logo and traditional acrylic split-diamond inlay.

When guitar star Les Paul and Gibson president Ted McCarty sat down at the start of the 1950s to design a revolutionary new solidbody electric guitar, they originally envisioned two versions of the Les Paul Model: a \u2018standard,\u2019 which arrived first in the Goldtop of 1952, and a black Custom model with gold hardware, intended to be the creme de la creme. The 1954 Custom debuted with two single-coil pickups, but McCarty had already set Seth Lover and a team of Gibson designers the task of developing a revolutionary new humbucking pickup, which first hit the scene on the Les Paul Custom and Les Paul Goldtop in 1957. While the Les Paul Custom has always been a supremely elegant instrument\u2014a \u2018black tie\u2019 guitar for the formal crowd, as Les originally conceived it\u2014many have come off the line over the years considerably heavier than the typical Les Paul Standard.", "ItemID": "283279952578", "EndTime": "2018-12-04T02:47:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-27T19:09:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom-Lite-White-2016-/283279952578", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Spring, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832799525788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIyWDE1OTc=/z/EzQAAOSwSn1b~ZZx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5N1g2MDc=/z/2jQAAOSw5qJb~ZVm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MwIAAOSwXMxb~ZU5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMxMlg3OTI=/z/Yr4AAOSwg2lb~ZWF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z14AAOSwkERb~ZU6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyMlg3MjQ=/z/2fQAAOSwypZb~ZWb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "77381", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "davidwbickle", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 531, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 908}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Custom Lite White 2016", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 330, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1625.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
