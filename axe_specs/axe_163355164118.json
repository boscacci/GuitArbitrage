{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a 2018 Warmoth Stratocaster in candy red gloss finish. The body was originally built to be HSS, but it has since been converted to a \"swimming pool\" route, so any pickup combination will work (See photos). It comes equipped with EMG active pickups (89X in the bridge, and 89XR in the neck). There is a double battery box in the back, and it is wired with EMG's solderless wiring system. There are also two push-pull knobs so you can split each pickup individually. It has been professionally set up and the frets have been leveled and dressed. The tuners are Schaller M6 locking tuners, and the bridge is a Wilkinson 2-point tremolo. Here are all of the exact specs directly from the Warmoth order: Body:Model:Stratocaster\u00aeOrientation:Right handedScale:25-1/2\"Wood:Swamp Ash Rout:Top RoutPickup Rout:Strat\u00ae, Strat\u00ae, HumbuckerControls:NoneBridge:American Standard Strat\u00ae TremoloJack Rout:Strat\u00ae Top Jack RoutNeck Pocket:Strat\u00ae ShapeMounting Holes:Standard 4 BoltContours:/ Tummy Cut / Forearm ContourF-Holes:NoneBattery Box:Double Battery Box Top Finish:Candy Red Back Finish:Candy RedFinish Type:Gloss Finish Neck:Style:CBS Stratocaster\u00aeConstruction:Modern Construction Scale:25-1/2\"Orientation:Right HandedNeck Wood:MapleFingerboard Wood:MapleNut Width:1-11/16\"Back Shape:FatbackFret Size:SS6150 (Stainless) Tuner Ream:Vintage Style (11/32\")Radius:10-16\" CompoundFret #:21Mounting Holes:Standard 4 BoltInlays:Black Face DotsSide Dots:Black Side DotsString Nut:White Corian - Earvana Nut Finish:Clear Satin Nitro This is a great guitar that has a unique sound with the EMGs. In its current setup, it would be comparable to the \"super Strats\" of the '80s. This can be played right out of the box, or it can serve as a good start for a project guitar. It has a fairly large neck and stainless steel frets which make it really nice to play. It's in perfect condition except for a small chip in the paint, but the guitar is 100% functional. It was not used in any gigs, I only used it at home for recording.
