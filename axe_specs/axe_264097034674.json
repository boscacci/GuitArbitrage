{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a 2013 Gibson SG Future Tribute w/upgraded 490R/490T pickups. Great rock/metal guitar with resonance and sustain for days thanks to a mahogany body and set-in neck. She is in perfect working order, and excellent shape overall. Neck is straight, fretboard is clean, and frets show no wear. I bought this guitar because I love how simple and straight-forward it is. The asymmetrical Gibson neck is super comfy, and is smooth and fast. Since this is a \"Future\" model, it came stock with Steinberger gear less tuners. While I admit I was a bit skeptical at first, I quickly warmed to them...changing a set of strings takes less than 5 minutes, and the guitar holds its tune much better than with stock tuners. Plus...they look GREAT and add to the metal feel. While the stock '57 Classic pickups were good, I felt they were mis-matched for the tone and the look of the guitar. So, I upgraded to a hotter set of 490R/490T humbuckers from Gibson. Great decision...these pickups have much more attack than the stock '57 Classics, and the chrome covers give them a more metal look and feel that I thought matched the guitar better. This guitar uses the Gibson Quick Connect system, so changing the pickups was a snap. I also added a 3-ply pick guard to complete the look...overall, I LOVE result. Pure rock! This a your chance to own a unique SG with plenty of bite for a great price. Thanks for looking...she comes with the hard case shown.", "ItemID": "264097034674", "EndTime": "2018-12-30T19:25:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T01:05:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2013-Gibson-SG-Future-Tribute-w-upgraded-490R-498T-Pickups-Made-USA-/264097034674", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Norman, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640970346748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/NKoAAOSwIqxcHDut/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/M50AAOSwkDtcHDux/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/IvYAAOSwXitcHDu1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/95EAAOSw29JcHDu5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/5gEAAOSw87lcHDu9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/4TAAAOSwyApcHDvB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/AhYAAOSw8kRcHDvF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/cZIAAOSwQqZcHDvJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/Ka4AAOSwkFZcHDvN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/m7MAAOSwH1pcHDvS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/EYgAAOSwikBcHDvV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "73071", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eglantyne", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2883, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 243}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2013 Gibson SG Future Tribute w/upgraded 490R/498T Pickups Made in USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Future"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Matte Ebony"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 356, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=12325787", "StoreName": "Claire&#39;s Closet Corner"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent used condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
