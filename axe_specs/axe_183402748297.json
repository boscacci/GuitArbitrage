{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1984 Fender Stratocaster '57 American Vintage Reissue, Fullerton era. This is a fantastic player grade Fullerton. A luthier with 40+ years of experience did the following:Installed bone nutRepaired the crack in the pickguard (it is not loose)This same luthier recently did the following (December 8, 2018 update):Installed a replacement string tree (he used an old one with era-appropriate patina)Filled the second string tree holeRemoved some shielding around the pickups that a previous owner installed.Installed a more appropriate orange drop capacitor (the previous capacitor was not original)Cleaned the potsFrets are original and there is minimal wear to the frets. The wear that is visible is at the first few frets. There is some beautiful patina on the edges of the neck; actual play wear from real playing. Notice the two-piece body. Many Fullerton Strats have three piece bodies. This guitar has a nice two piece body with fantastic grain. The finish is glossy and there is minimal checking of the lacquer on the back side of the guitar. This guitar has lived in it's case in my smoke free home. In 1984 when this guitar was built, a 1957 Stratocaster would have been 26 or 27 years old. This guitar is now 33, almost 34 years old. The necks on this guitar is slim and comfortable. This guitar plays and sounds fantastic, and is currently set up with fairly low action. The original hard shell case is included, along with the stuff that you see. I will ship to continental U.S. only. I will ship this guitar in the same way that I would like to receive a guitar. It will be well protected. Send questions. I'm ready to let this thing go. Shoot an offer! This is an old update, for reference:*** UPDATE (November 21, 2018): I have taken the guitar to a luthier to have the shielding around the pickups removed. I will post all-new updated photos as soon as I get the guitar back. Based on feedback that I have received from questions asked, the shielding has been not desirable for many who are interested in this guitar. The shielding was not done by me, and does not impact the sound, in my opinion, but it is being removed. Once I get the guitar back I will update the photos, and I'll probably change the price to Buy It Now or best offer. The current photos do not do the finish justice. I will post higher quality photos with better angles. Also, I neglected to include in the photos the original ash tray cover, tremolo arm, backplate cover, and envelope for springs.***", "ItemID": "183402748297", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T20:38:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-08-28T04:29:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1984-Fender-Stratocaster-57-Reissue-American-Vintage-AVRI-FULLERTON-OHSC-/183402748297", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Spring, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1834027482978080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1JoAAOSwEwhcDD~-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cGAAAOSwG25cDEAy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-ewAAOSwPGtcDEBr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vkkAAOSwOHpcDECX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/svwAAOSwEphcDD~l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mGEAAOSwS4VcDD~i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/260AAOSwVH9cDD~u/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RGMAAOSw~9VcGHfj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ffgAAOSwR4dbhMwI/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KbMAAOSwk6dbhNCq/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9qsAAOSw-4JcDEFe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wx8AAOSwmaJcDEFV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "77379", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ainzo85", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 217, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 52}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1984 Fender Stratocaster '57 Reissue American Vintage AVRI FULLERTON with OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster 57 Reissue"]}]}, "HitCount": 3588, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
