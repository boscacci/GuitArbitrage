{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1992 Gibson Les Paul Classic Plus with fantastic flame. This guitar has not been heavily played. Frets are in fantastic shape (90%+) with very dark rosewood fret board. I have seen a lot of these and this one is in the best shape of any that have passed through my hands. The Rare Fuchsia has held its color better than any other example I have seen. Just a fantastic example. Based on the 1960 Les Paul, these were the top of the line Gibson Les Paul's in the early 90s. The 91 and 92 years are particularly desirable. These were the precursor to the Gibson Custom Shop. Guitar has the slim 60s neck profile and weights in at 9.5 lbs. There are minor dings on the lower top (nothing through the surface) and a few marks on the back. You can see them in the pictures. I replaced the originals pots with a full set of Emerson Custom Shop Pots and Emerson replica Bumble Bee caps. I also changed the pickups to a Duncan Distortion in the bridge and a Duncan Saturday Night Special in the Neck Position. Guitar looks and sounds badass.. Guitars case is in decent condition and the case shawl is still attached. Any Questions 732 779 5967 The original pickups and Pots/Caps will come with the guitar... Thanks let me know if you have any questions...", "ItemID": "153315261560", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T18:16:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T01:48:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1992-Gibson-Les-Paul-Classic-Plus-/153315261560", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lakewood, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533152615608080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ4WDc1Mg==/z/4hkAAOSwi1lb-Ku5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzIx/z/K3kAAOSwjt1b-Kuj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OVgxNjAw/z/jmwAAOSwaiBb-Kum/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTgzWDc2OA==/z/I20AAOSwnv9b-Ku8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzM5/z/v7EAAOSwikJb-Kuc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExN1gxNjAw/z/BmEAAOSw2-pb-Kuf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDI1/z/e3MAAOSwXWhb-Kuz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzY1/z/K4cAAOSwjt1b-Kuv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTcyWDc0Ng==/z/CKIAAOSwfhlb-Ku3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE3OVgxNjAw/z/2-YAAOSwh39b-Kup/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjcx/z/jsYAAOSwPuRb-Kus/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDM=/z/sTgAAOSwmOBb-Ku2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "08701", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "elavolpe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 130, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 8988}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1992 Gibson Les Paul Classic Plus ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany/Maple Top"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1992"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Fuchsia"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Classic Plus"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 42, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
