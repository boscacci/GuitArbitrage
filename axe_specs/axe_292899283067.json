This guitar was first featured by Alex Lifeson during the Rush Clockwork Angels Tour. The condition is excellent. Very light use and stored in protective hardshell case since purchased. (8 lbs., 13.1 oz.) For over 40 years, guitar virtuoso Alex Lifeson from the world-renowned Canadian progressive rock band Rush, has taken progressive rock guitar to new heights! The Alex Lifeson Les Paul Axcess employs time-tested Les Paul tonewood \u2013 a maple top and mahogany back. This model is ergonomically contoured to sit perfectly against your body as you play. The incredibly versatile electronics and hardware are really what puts this instrument in a class by itself. A pair of high output 490R and 498T humbuckers serve up timeless power, bite, and growl while push-pull volume controls allow for each pick up to expand sonically by offering up series/parallel wiring options. The Floyd Rose tremolo will keep you in tune after the most aggressive vibratos. The vibrato unit is also equipped with Graph Tech Ghost piezo saddles that will enhance your tonal palette with warm, acoustic sounds. Also featured are dual output jacks that allow you to blend the sound of the piezo and magnetic pickups and also to use two cables to split to stereo outputs. The guitar comes complete with a Custom Shop hardshell case and a certificate of Authenticity that showcases Alex Lifeson\u2019s signature. Own a piece of Rush history! This guitar is phenomenal!
