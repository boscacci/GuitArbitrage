{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered for sale; Used 2005 Gretsch G6119-1962HT Tennessee Rose serial number JT05106280. This guitar is in near mint condition showing little playing time. Originally known as the Tennessean, Gretsch has produced a variety of G6119 Tennessee Rose guitars over the years. The variations include different pickup options, simulated or real F-holes, different bridge options, Chet Atkins signature or not on the pickguard. The Tennessean got a huge amount of notoriety by George Harrison. First in late 1963, later at Carnegie Hall, and then on the For Sale album. He also used it on TV appearances well into 1965 as well as in the opening sequence of the film Help! and at the first Shea Stadium concert that August. It was used again on Sgt. Pepper. Gretsch states: \u201cBy any other name this guitar would still sound sweeter than honey. A throwback from the early era of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, the G6119 Tennessee Rose Hollow Body with Bigsby is a solid performer with the sound and the style that have made Gretsch a household name. Highly resonant, the unique voice of this guitar cuts through any mix, standing out from the crowd with That Great Gretsch Sound!\u201d Features include HiLo'Tron single-coil pickups, deep burgundy stain, simulated f-holes, and single-ply binding on the top and fingerboard. Neo Classic thumbnail inlay position markers, black headstock overlay, bound fingerboard, silver plexi pickguard, and knurled strap retainer knobs. Controls include a master volume, a volume for each pickup, a standby switch, a 3-way pickup selector switch, and a 3-position tone switch. This is a beautiful instrument, plays well and sounds like a \u201cGretsch\u201d! Hard-shell case included. \u201cWe carefully inspect every instrument when we buy it and bring it up to our standards before we offer it for sale. We also do a full set up before we ship.
