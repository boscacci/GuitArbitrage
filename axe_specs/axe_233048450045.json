{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Played very little. No significant marks anywhere! Can't find original paper work. Was built for me by luthier Ron Jones at Warpdrive (Cream City ) music in Wisconsin.I believe the body is Alder ( weighs 8lbs ) Mighty Mite.The neck is also Mighty Mite, I believe. 22 frets, medium jumbos, Leveled and polished.Fender locking tuners.Bridge is a fat block fender!Pickup is a Tony Iommi humbucker!3-way switch. In neck position it's full humbucker. In middle position, it splits the coils for a single coil sound. In the bridge position, it's off.Had it built for a shredder type axe, and that it is! You can back off volume and it cleans up fairly well. But it likes to be pushed loud!This guy has built a few guitars for me. His work is excellent. Setup is spot on, with 3 springs on tremelo, It's pulled down against the body and stays in tune! Any marks you see in the pictures, are just my bad photography or, light reflections. No issues I can see anywhere,including neck pocket! Shipped in a TKL hard shell case!Lower 48 only", "ItemID": "233048450045", "EndTime": "2018-12-22T17:17:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-15T17:17:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-made-Stratocaster-strat-Guitar-Tony-Iommi-pickup-/233048450045", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Locust Grove, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330484500458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/u0sAAOSwP8dcC9lV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q5kAAOSwsPNcC9lp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6twAAOSwus5cC9l5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GLoAAOSwVEFcC9mO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lJ0AAOSwbKdcC9mj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0SgAAOSwAP9cC9my/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7tEAAOSw4VpcC9nB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SzYAAOSwCXFcC9nM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ljwAAOSwSn1cC9rd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3RYAAOSw6IdcFTVR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30248", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "clamb555", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1294, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 345.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 345.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1041}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom made Stratocaster/strat Guitar- Tony Iommi pickup!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 126, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
