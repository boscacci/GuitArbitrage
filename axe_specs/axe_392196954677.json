ESP has designed some great guitars and their deluxe series has its own distinctive look and feel with top of the line appointments. Ours is sooo clean your friends will think it is new :-) The only reason it is not dead mint, is there are some very faint pic scratches and it is missing the tremolo bar. This set neck guitar is well balanced and plays very nice w/ low action. It features an Ebony fretboard with fancy inlays and binding, grover tuners, dual EMG humbuckers and a double locking tremolo. Still holds tune fine so included a new set of D\u2019Adario XLs for your next change. Includes a simple padded gig bag to keep it warm and happy.
