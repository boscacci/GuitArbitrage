{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a used item, but it is still pretty good! The built in amp is semi damaged but if you know how to or know someone who can fix it, its pretty much a great guitar. There are some minor marks and scratches on it, but not many that are noticeable. Little marker marks are also on it as well. I've only seen this guitar at fry's and that is when it was bought years ago other than that, I have not seen it before. There is a place where you can plug in a amplifier but it is missing a metal piece to hold it. The built in amp is battery based as well.", "ItemID": "352534474937", "EndTime": "2018-12-10T17:33:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T17:33:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squier-Hello-Kitty-Pink-Full-Sized-Stratocaster-6-String-Electric-Guitar-/352534474937", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Houston, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525344749378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aksAAOSwr5db8vCj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/V-YAAOSw1iVb8vCk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/35IAAOSwuNNb8vCj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XJMAAOSwa29b8vCk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SHwAAOSwDTBb8vCk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "77049", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "alagar-37", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 248}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squier Hello Kitty Pink Full Sized Stratocaster 6 String Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Magenta"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Built-in Amp"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 134, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
