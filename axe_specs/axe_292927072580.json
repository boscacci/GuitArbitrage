{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender American Standard Stratocaster Neck in Rosewood 2007 This is the flagship range neck with medium jumbo frets, 9\u201d radius, bi-flex truss rod, and satin finish. Rosewood is the fingerboard wood of choice for many guitarists and it is becoming increasingly rare due to the ban on it\u2019s export (for new items). This is a fine example with a beautiful even figuring from dark to light that contrasts stunningly with the maple of the back and headstock. It also features the staggered height tuners only found on the top of the range models Complete with Original Neck Plate and Screws The condition of this neck is MINT! - there are no dings (even on the end of the headstock!), scratches or lifting of the lacquer anywhere. This has been a well looked after unplayed neck, as can be seen by the absolute zero fretwear; -no marks on even the bottom frets. This neck is a neck in virtually brand new condition. Of course it has no issues ie no warping, a fully functional truss rod and solid unworn original Fender tuners. This genuine Fender USA neck is the ultimate upgrade for any Strat type guitar - unless it\u2019s already got one!
