{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2013 Gibson Les Paul Electric Guitar This is a previously owned 2013 Gibson Les Paul Electric Guitar. Full disclosure, I am not the original owner of this guitar and I do not know what changes have or haven't been made. I have done the research over the various websites to make sure that the guitar is a legit Gibson and it checks out as far as the neck, bridge, script, etc. However, the truss rod cover is marked \"Standard\" and this appears to be more of a gold top 70s tribute that has had modifications. I know very little about guitars so I will let those of you more educated than me take a look. First off, the guitar has some issues. It's a gold top finish but the finish is damaged. The finish is heavily cracked as well as a couple of checks on the body of the guitar. There is no binding on the body or neck. There are also a handful of checks on the back of the guitar, one on the neck and various little dings and marks. The guitar has been beat up a bit. The pickups are \"Dirty Fingers\" pickups. I'm not sure if the volume and tone knobs have been changed out. As stated previously the truss rod cover is marked Standard but I don't believe it to be original to the guitar. It is a 2 screw cover with the top screw being close to the edge of the piece. The Les Paul script appears correct and their are different widths within the signature lines. The tuning machines are Grover machines. The neck is one piece as it is supposed to be. The serial number checks out to June 2013 in the Nashville Plant. The larger back cover is missing a couple of the screws. The guitar comes with a Gibson USA gig bag. It is black with white lining. What you see is exactly what you get. I've done my best to describe and photograph the guitar. It will most likely need a set up and some love. Please look closely at all photos. A signature will be required upon delivery.
