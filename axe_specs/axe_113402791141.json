{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Traded two acoustic guitars for this about 10 years ago. I am strictly an acoustic player and have only played this a few times. I don't even know what the knobs on it do. I take it out 3 or 4 times a year and polish it with Martin Guitar Polish to keep the checking down as I do with my other 8 acoustics.. It does have some checking on both front and back that doesn't show up in the pictures. It plays fine, neck is straight and except for checking looks almost new. No scratches or dings. Some wear on the pickguard. I only have a small amplifier that I use with my Fender acoustic, but it sounds great with the small amp. I have never put new strings on it, so it will need new strings. I don't know of anything wrong with it. For a guitar this old, it is in amazing condition. NOTE: Case included. The case is NOT a Gibson case. It is a Washburn, but fits the es330 fine. SELLING AS IS, NO RETURNS. I verified the age from the Gibson serial number website. I was told it was an es330, but pictures on ebay of an es335 look just like itl so I'm not sure which one it is. If you don't have a good positive purchasing record with EBAY, please don't bid..", "ItemID": "113402791141", "EndTime": "2018-11-30T20:16:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-26T18:36:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Custom-ES-330-Electric-Guitar-Red-Hollow-body-great-condition-/113402791141", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kingston, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134027911418080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/818AAOSwzqtb8v8Z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/o0cAAOSwkFZb8v8h/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5QcAAOSwa3lb8v8u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GzoAAOSw-HRb8v83/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iWUAAOSwxPNb8v88/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WcUAAOSwIKNb8v9F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TgkAAOSwwtdb8v98/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9YAAAOSwEKpb8v-G/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hKYAAOSw84Zb8v-T/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RgMAAOSwN5hb8v-8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7-EAAOSwwFNb8v~z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BNIAAOSwoZJb~E3Q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "73439", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "de61fishing", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 325, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 92.9}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3694}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Custom ES-330 Electric Guitar - Red -Hollow body-great condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1967"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-330"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["HB015M"]}]}, "HitCount": 63, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "137004235", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
