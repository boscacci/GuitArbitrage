{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Thank you for visiting our Ebay store. This is a very nice Squier 51 Pawn Shop Guitar with Fender Gig Bag. Color is 2-Tone Sunburst. Overall condition is Very Good. There are a couple of blems as shown in the pics. We cleaned the frets and put new strings on because the guitar hadn't been used in a long time. It came from the original owner who had a collection and really didn't play. It is a well made instrument and the neck feels great. There are no breaks, mods, or repairs.We believe you will be very happy with your purchase!When you buy from me, expect to receive what you see in the pics. I know the feeling of buying something sight unseen only to find out the seller was not that accurate. I have been selling on Ebay for more than a decade and I am only happy when you are happy! Buyer has 24 hours to contact me and 3 days to complete payment transaction. If this criteria is not met, the item will be sold to someone else. Please keep in mind with shipping, when you buy a guitar from me, you are not just paying for shipping. You are paying for my time and experience in packaging delicate items, as well as the cost of new boxes and shipping peanuts. Thanks. Please email me with any questions and good luck in bidding!", "ItemID": "333047601494", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T03:23:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T03:17:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2005-Squier-51-Guitar-Sunburst-w-bag-/333047601494", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pompano Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330476014948080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QfAAAOSwtYZcRfAl/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZpEAAOSwH4dcRfCV/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PEsAAOSwZnpcRfCx/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cnQAAOSwcXhcRfC-/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/15kAAOSwnh5cRfC0/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VVUAAOSwWN5cRfC4/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4AkAAOSw6KxcRfCZ/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uYUAAOSwveFcRfDK/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uI8AAOSwyn1cRfCc/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/i~oAAOSwu4dcRfCm/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oNcAAOSwvapcRfCq/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PEkAAOSwZnpcRfCt/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33065", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spinesplitter", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1615, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 159.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 159.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***-", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 11}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2005 Squier 51 Guitar Sunburst w/bag!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 30, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=11691455", "StoreName": "Hear For Music"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very Good with a couple of marks but nothing serious", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
