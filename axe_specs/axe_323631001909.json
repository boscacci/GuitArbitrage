{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a beautiful, as-new Knaggs \"Steve Stevens\" in Tobacco Burst finish, from my personal collection. The SSC model is Knaggs' effort to return to the vintage roots of the single-cut double humbucker style guitar, but with all the benefits of modern styling and technology.The body is mahogany with a lightly figured, deeply carved maple top. Neck is mahogany with an ebony fingerboard, marked with very unusual inlays and a bone nut. The headstock is also ebony with a \"ray gun\" inlay. Very cool! Kluson tuners, Schaller strap-locks and Bareknuckle pickups round out the list of top-notch appointments on this fine instrument, which weighs in at an even 9 pounds of rock'n'roll BEAST! And when I say it is a beast, I mean that in every sense of the word. These Bareknuckle pickups can get as hot and raunchy as you need, but also clean up very nicely, and are extremely organic and alive at the fingertips. If you've ever played a guitar where your pick attack alone can make a big difference in the tone, this is THAT kind of guitar. And playability is simply outstanding. The neck is fast and comfortable, not thin, just a perfect handful, with the feel of ebony on the fingertips...exquisite! This guitar comes with the original Knaggs-logo'd hard-shell case with green plush interior and all case candy including truss-rod wrench, sticker, build sheet, etc. For a guitar with all the modern appointments that Knaggs is known for, the overall look is very vintage and traditional which is unusual to the brand. I had a long search to find one without ridiculous amounts of wavy flame all over the top, or painted with a flashy colour, and I haven't seen another one like it since. One last note I'd like to make clear, this guitar isn't particularly suited for classic jazz. It is just too powerful. As such, it's not the perfect guitar for me after all. I thought about changing out the pickups to SD Antiquities, but in the end I decided to leave it stock and allow it to pass on to someone who will appreciate it for what it is, and what it was meant to be. In every other respect you can imagine, I love this guitar. In addition to selling outright, I would consider trade for a similar guitar with a more mellow tone and aspect. Let me know if you are interested. Thanks for looking. Please ask any questions you might have. I will answer promptly and courteously. Check my feedback and make your purchase with complete confidence.
