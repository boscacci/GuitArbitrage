{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale: Les Paul Traditional 2016. Lightly played only at home, never gigged with. Comes from a 100% non-smoking home. Beautiful condition. New strings. Comes with original case and documentation as pictured. Went to four Sam Ash and Guitar Center locations and played every Les Paul available, this was the best I could find. Hate to sell, but focusing on other hobbies. Feel free to message with questions. On Jan-08-19 at 17:29:37 PST, seller added the following information: PLEASE NOTE: this item is NOT \"mint\" and is a used guitar. There are signs of wear are that of typical light use, as I purchased this as an instrument to be played, not collected. There are some small, shallow scratches around the input jack and on the pick guard, for example, but nothing that has damaged the material, would require repair, or that can even be photographed due to how minor they are. These are wear signs that can be found even on guitars in shops that have been test-played. There are no scratches, there are no dings such as being scraped, dropped, or knocked against anything or have anything dropped on it. The only flaw I can find in the guitar is a 0.5mm divet in the clear coat near one of the knobs, which took significant effort to even find and get a photograph of (photo 12, circled.) Any other wear is simply too small or shallow to get photos of. On Jan-08-19 at 17:33:21 PST, seller added the following information: Also, no binding separation.
