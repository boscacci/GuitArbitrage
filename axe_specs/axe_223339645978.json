This guitar is in good condition with a few minor flaws thought-out the frame of the guitar. The headstock has light scratching, three chips and what looks like dried adhesive substance.

When inspecting the front face, we notice dried adhesive substance on the upper left corner of the pearl scratch guard and drops of the substance on the right side of the body.

The back of the guitar also has a small amount of dried adhesive substance on the bottom and a few small dents. From the back on the upper right side there are a small number of nicks on the finish.
