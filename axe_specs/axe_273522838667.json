{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "When is the last Time you have seen a Kent 1960's Violin Shape Guitar ?This Guitar is rare and the natural color is rare as well.Some blames and blemische as you would expect from an almost 50 Year old Guitar.Very nice condition for it's age. Frets are in good shape and the Guitar plays nicely. Beautiful Tone as well. Hate to sell but I need to sell. I think the Bridge is not original. The Knobs are not original and one knob is slightly broken, please consult the pictures. Truss rod work perfectly. Electronics work as they should. Slide switch works OK but like most of them does not really lock in. READ THE DESCRIPTIONS SCRUTINIZE THE PICTURES ASK QUESTIONS NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS Please see my other listings for Guitars. I try to list one Guitar every week or so. KEEP LOOKING, thanks. We only ship to the confirmed address provided by PayPal.
