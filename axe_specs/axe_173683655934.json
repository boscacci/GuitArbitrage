{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Open the case of this guitar and you'll find a guitar that looks and plays like a factory-fresh Gretsch guitar. Take advantage of this opportunity to own a guitar, that looks factory fresh, for considerably lower than retail cost. I am selling this guitar because I have decided to reduce my guitar collection. This guitar is part of collection that was occasionally played in a home recording studio environment and is in pristine condition. If you would like to own a Gretsch Country Gentleman, that looks like it came directly from Gretsch--this guitar will fulfill that desire--at a price, much lower than a new guitar. 2010 Gretsch Country Gentleman, model G6122-II, from Gretsch's Professional Collection. The neck joins the body at the 18th fret, giving easier accessibility to the upper fretboard, especially with the double-cutaway body. The guitar plays well, is well-intonated for the full range of the fretboard, and is good about \"keeping in tune\". As the photos show, both the Guitar and Hard Shell Case are in exceptional condition. The truss rod adjusting tool and key to lock the guitar case are included. Seller will pay for guitar to be professionally boxed for shipment. Buyer pays for shipping.
