{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2012 Gibson Les Paul Junior Special SINGLE CUTAWAY w/ P90's IN THE GLOSS EBONY FINISH. THIS IS A VERY LIGHTLY USED GUITAR ! ! ! I JUST ACQUIRED IT THROUGH A LOCAL ESTATE IN WHICH THE FORMER OWNER WAS A HUGE GUITAR COLLECTOR , CUSTOMIZER AND AVID PLAYER FOR OVER 30 YEARS. I PURCHASED SEVERAL GUITARS FROM THE ESTATE ALL OF WHICH WERE IN MINT / NEW CONDITION. THIS ONE IN MY OPINION IS \" NEAR MINT\" WITH ONLY SOME VERY MINOR SIGNS OF AGE / USE. THERE IS NO PAINT-LOSS OR CHIPS ANYWHERE ON THIS GUITAR. THE GLOSS IS BEAUTIFUL AS SEEN IN THE PHOTOS. THERE ARE SOME RANDOM SUPERFICIAL / VERY LIGHT SCRATCHES THAT I BELIEVE WOULD PROBABLY GO AWAY WITH A GOOD POLISHING / BUFFING. THESE SCRATCHES / MARKS ARE ONLY NOTICEABLE IF LOOKING UP CLOSE FOR THEM. THERE IS 1 SMALL DENT ON THE SIDE OF THE GUITAR WHICH I HAVE SHOWN IN THE PHOTOS. THE PICK-GUARD SHOWS SIGNS OF LIGHT USE . THE PREVIOUS OWNER UPGRADED THE TUNERS TO KLUSON SEALFAST WAFFLEBACK MACHINE TUNERS. THIS GUITAR HAS BEEN KEPT IN THE GIBSON GEAR HARDSHELL CASE FOR MOST OF IT'S LIFE WHICH HAS KEPT IT IN AMAZING CONDITION ! THE GUITAR OWNERS MANUAL AND INSPECTION CARD ARE INCLUDED IN THE CASE AS WELL. THERE ARE SOME REFLECTIONS IN THE PHOTOS FROM THE LIGHTING IN MY STORE . SERIAL # 100021549 - MADE IN U.S.A. IN THE NASHVILLE PLANT ON 12/31/2012 . PRODUCTION #249. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR NEED ADDITIONAL PHOTOS PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK !! I WANT YOU TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE BIDDING ON ! SHIPPING PRICES / QUOTES YOU SEE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUAL PACKAGE SIZE AND WEIGHT FROM MY DOOR TO YOURS. I DO NOT PROFIT ON SHIPPING SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME FOR CHEAPER OPTIONS AS I DO NOT HAVE ANY. IT WILL BE PADDED & SHIPPED IN THE CASE SHOWN WHICH WILL THEN BE WRAPPED IN A COUPLE LAYERS OF CARDBOARD FOR PROTECTION. WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PHOTOS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE !
