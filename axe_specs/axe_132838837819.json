{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "G & L Legacy \u201cBright Red\u201d This over 20 years old guitar still looks almost like new. Somewhere from the 1990's. It has been cosmetically touched up keeping it looking fresh. For instance, the neck in one spot is slightly lighter where there was a touch up and the bottom edge of the body has had a couple of chip fixes. The red finish has unique metallic sparkles in it and I can\u2019t seem to find another one that has this unique red color finish. To put it simply, it looks cool and is fun to play! As any 20 year plus instrument it has play wear, but hardly noticeable. There is no buckle rash to mention. The first 4 frets do have a little wear as you can see in the photos if you zoom in. Also, the hard case is missing the middle lock as it was broken off by airport handlers on the return from a gig years ago. It is outfitted with fresh set of Vintage \u201cHard Rockin\u2019 Steel\u201d number 9 strings. I also include an additional set of these Vintage strings with the sale. You may prefer to change the strings to 10\u2019s once you own it. The G&L Legacy electric Strat style guitar is considered a high-quality instrument.I have read that they are supposedly designed to the specifications of the original Stratocaster but with a few modern features specific to G&L instruments.
