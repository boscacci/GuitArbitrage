{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Harley Benton CST 24T guitar. It was new a couple months ago and is a beautiful flame red. I upgraded the pickups with new wax dipped humbuckers and will include the original pickups that came in it.This guitar does not have a flaw in it anywhere and plays and sounds amaxing. It has new Ernie Ball 9s Super Slinky strings on it. The only reason I am selling it is it has a slim neck and I mostly play SGs that have thicker necks and I just can't get used to it.On Dec-02-18 at 19:14:58 PST, seller added the following information: I mistakenly told one inquirer that this guitar was made in China but it was made in Viet Nam", "ItemID": "113416099646", "EndTime": "2018-12-09T01:02:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T01:02:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Harley-Benton-CST-24T-Cherry-Flame-Guitar-/113416099646", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bloomfield, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134160996468080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/flEAAOSwEcxcAyHj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XysAAOSwF5VcAyHt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r6AAAOSwBVdcAyHy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p4oAAOSw5wJcAyIK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mA8AAOSwtFxcAyIS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LjwAAOSw5YlcAyIo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "47424", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jamesoralhaldeman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 157.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 157.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 158}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Harley Benton CST 24T Cherry Flame Guitar ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Harley Benton"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 274, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 160.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
