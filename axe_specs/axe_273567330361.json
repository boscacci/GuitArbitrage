I have since retired from active gigging and no longer have a need for it (shame though....really nice guitar). Everything about the guitar is in good to very good condition....some very minor swirl and light pick marks (no dents or deep mars), typical of what you might find on any well cared for used guitar. Plays/sounds great....stays in tune (as it should with a properly set up Floyd Rose....its a rock) and would be an great addition to anyone looking for a great rock guitar sound. Does not include a case or gig bag, but it will be carefully prepped and packaged (original box) to ensure safe shipping. Although the guitar is as described above, its a used instrument and is being sold as is. See my feedback and bid with confidence. Good luck!", "ItemID": "273567330361", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T03:10:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T03:10:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EVH-Wolfgang-Standard-6-String-Electric-Guitar-Transparent-Red-Used-/273567330361", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Murfreesboro, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735673303618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/j-cAAOSw8PJb8iQt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s5EAAOSwwhxb8iQy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc1WDE2MDA=/z/r60AAOSwJd1b8iQ2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxMlgxNjAw/z/IrkAAOSwq2xb8iQ4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pzQAAOSwWW5b8iQ8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sfIAAOSw8Mxb8iRA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PRsAAOSwe9Fb8iRE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37130", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tommyrok", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 241, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 29}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EVH Wolfgang Standard 6-String Electric Guitar - Transparent Red Used", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["EVH"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["EVH Wolfgang Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 229, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
