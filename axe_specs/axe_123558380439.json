The ES-137 Custom is a perfect example. Gibson never built any instrument quite like this until recently. It clearly combines two distinctive influences: The look of Gibson's single cuataway, semi-hollowbodies and the hot sound of a Les Paul Classic. Is it a blues guitar? A rock guitar? Or perhaps a jazz guitar? The answer is, it's all of these. With its feature set, it can play clean jazz or fusion lines. Crank your amp to \"11\" and it screams just like a Les Paul.
