You are looking at a 2018 Jackson Pro Series Signature Dave Davidson Warrior WR7. Over the last decade, Boston-based act Revocation has firmly established itself as one of the finest in today\u2019s death metal and thrash metal genres. Heralded as one of modern metal\u2019s elite guitarists, frontman Dave Davidson is also the driving force behind the band as it continues to evolve and challenge conventional metal norms. From The Web: Jackson continues its storied history of working with the best in the business with the creation of Davidson\u2019s Pro Series Signature Warrior\u2122 WR7 model, an instrument built for taking creative liberties and running the metal gamut. Davidson\u2019s take on Jackson\u2019s revered angular shape is in a 7-string form featuring a 25.5\u201d scale length, mahogany body with ash top and one-piece through-body maple neck with graphite reinforcement and scarf joint, providing the utmost stability against the rigors and ravages of the road. The oiled neck back finish allows for smooth playing feel, while its 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets is designed for highly technical lightspeed playing\u2014more curved by the nut for comfortable chording, it flattens out as you move up the neck for increasingly fast playing speed and wide bends without fretting out. To meet Revocation\u2019s propensity for building rich, complex chord voicings, Davidson teamed with DiMarzio\u00ae to create his own signature Imperium pickups, which power this signature Pro Series axe with dynamic tone and punchy clarity. Designed so that all notes ring through, from full-bodied, tight low end while using high gain amps to crystal clear cleans on non-distorted channels, these pickups are also highly responsive to harmonics. This axe also features a single tone control, a single volume control with push/pull coil split for single-coil tone and a three-way toggle switch. Dive-bomb or flutter at will with the Floyd Rose\u00ae FRT 1000 series double-locking tremolo bridge system, recessed for pick hand comfort and providing superior string stability, sustain and dynamic tremolo action. Dark and menacing with its Distressed Ash finish, black body, neck and headstock binding and black hardware, this signature Warrior is primed and ready for battle.Tech Specs Body Type: Solidbody Body Shape: Warrior Left-/Right-handed: Right-handed Number of Strings: 7 Body Material: Mahogany Top Material: Ash Body Finish: Satin Color: Distressed Ash Neck Material: Maple Radius: 12\"-16\" compound Fingerboard Material: Ebony Fingerboard Inlay: Pearloid Piranha Tooth Number of Frets: 24, Jumbo Scale Length: 25.5\" Nut Width: 1.875\" Nut Material: Floyd Rose Locking Bridge/Tailpiece: Floyd Rose FRT-SSO2000 Double-locking Tremolo (recessed) Tuners: Jackson Sealed Die-cast Neck Pickup: DiMarzio Dave Davidson Signature Imperium Humbucker Bridge Pickup: DiMarzio Dave Davidson Signature Imperium Humbucker Controls: 1 x volume (push/pull coil split), 1 x tone, 3-way toggle pickup switch Strings: NPS, .009-.054 Our luthier did a complete setup.
