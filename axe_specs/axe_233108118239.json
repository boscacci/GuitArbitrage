{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is a very rare 1981 USA Kramer StageMaster with a wood neck and strat headstock. It is in excellent+ cosmetic and functional condition. A true case queen. This guitar represents the time period when Kramer was transitioning away from aluminum necks to wood ones. This specific Stagemaster slips right into the even smaller pocket of time just before (and alongside) the next release of rare Kramer strat body and wood neck guitars. This guitar (in total) was originally offered by Kramer in 1981. Please see last photo with snapshot of 1981 Kramer advertisement. The StageMaster model (produced almost exclusively with an aluminum neck) was once offered with wood neck/strat head option. The serial number begins with an \"A\" which represents early Kramer guitars. I've owned and played 1981-82 strat body/strat head guitars well into the double digits and this Stagemaster definitely produces the best tones. I attribute this - in part - to the Schaller non trem bridge (a rare component on its own) and the 8 pound 13 ounces of heft to aid sustain. Due to its design, history, rarity and excellent condition this could be the crown jewel to a Kramer collection. This auction is limited to lower-48 bidders only. Shipping price posted is flat rate to wherever this guitar ends up going to in the lower-48. Please factor the 65 bucks into your bid price. Again, this is a $1 reserve auction. Highest bidder wins it. Guitar ships in a Kramer branded HSC. The corporate logo on the case is an earlier version, though I'm not 100% certain it is original to the guitar. To any additional questions posed I'll do my best to answer. Also, I have more photos (similar to those in listing, though at slightly different angles) and can provide if asked. Sale is final at conclusion of auction.", "ItemID": "233108118239", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T23:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T23:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1981-Kramer-Stagemaster-Imperial-Wood-Neck-Strat-Head-Very-Rare-1-Reserve-/233108118239", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hayden, Idaho", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331081182398080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Fw8AAOSwXnxcSijp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yvkAAOSw8a9cSijp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eQsAAOSwFlJcSijr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sKUAAOSwUXFcSilX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KlIAAOSwPWtcSijq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dM4AAOSw5YlcSijp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-jAAAOSwTxJcSijr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gl4AAOSwVN1cSijq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-YIAAOSwaaNcSijq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yBkAAOSwYV5cSijq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AfkAAOSws2RcSijp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAzWDg0Mg==/z/ncEAAOSwf0hcSijq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "83835", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lngtime356910", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 501, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 28, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 751.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 751.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3418}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1981 Kramer Stagemaster Imperial Wood Neck \"Strat Head\".
