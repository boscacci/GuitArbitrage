{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are bidding on a used Fender Stratocaster Aerodyne guitar. See the pictures for the condition of the guitar. It has some character wears and scratches that gives it somewhat of a vintage look and feel. The guitar is in good working condition; sounds and plays great! The overall shape is standard Stratocaster, however the top is arched.This is definitely not something you will find on U.S. or Mexican made Strats. The next thing is the binding that appears on the top. It\u2019s a white binding that is somewhat wider than you usually find on guitars today. These two major differences actually give the standard Strat design a very attractive appearance. One limited series of these guitars was made without the pick guard, although it was discontinued rather quickly. What you will usually find are pick guards that match the color of the guitar\u2019s body, giving it a very uniform look. This is where Aerodyne creates a bit of commotion. It\u2019s a Strat that sounds as good if not better than the U.S. made standard Strat, but comes with a price tag that is similar to a Mexican Strat. Some guitar players are insisting that these limited models are actually the best Strats on the market. As you can imagine, this creates a lot of friction in the Fender camp. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Fender Stratocaster Aerodyne performs way better than a Mexican Strat, that is for sure. However, whether or not it can match more elite Strats is debatable.", "ItemID": "233077229617", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T19:00:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T19:00:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Aerodyne-Stratocaster-Rare-/233077229617", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Madison, Mississippi", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330772296178080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tgQAAOSwtYZcK6~i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R3AAAOSwQ5pcK7PA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4JgAAOSwPXFcK6~p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zp8AAOSwHAxcK7O8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NVg2MzY=/z/gt4AAOSw87JcK78w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NDc=/z/BZ0AAOSwYV5cK79B/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ot0AAOSwgb1cK6~m/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EOkAAOSwaPNcK6~~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aKoAAOSwlINcK6~6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7W4AAOSw8DpcK6~3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/75AAAOSwFZZcK7Po/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TcMAAOSw1IhcK6~z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "39110", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eshop_now", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 442, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 31, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 316.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 316.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "w***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 116}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Aerodyne Stratocaster (Rare)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 433, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 321.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
