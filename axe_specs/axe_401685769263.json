{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Silvertone Reissue Model 1449 Electric Solid Body Guitar Have Questions? Send us a message and we will be glad to help you! Amped-up One of the most clever and well-known concepts in the early \u201960s guitar boom was the Silvertone Amp-in-case line. For well under $100, you could get a guitar that came in a case featuring a 5-watt (later, 6-watt) tube amp built right in. Just open the case halfway, stand it up, switch it on, and wail. The original guitar in the 1962 kit (1448) was a single pickup, short-neck model. A year later, the 2-pickup 1449 was introduced and the Amp-in-case really took off. The 1449 is the rarest of the breed, being replaced by the almost identical red-burst 1457 in 1964.
