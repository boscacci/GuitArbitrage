{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "It has been a while that I heard about the mystique surrounding this guitar so I was very excited when I found this one locally and this Peavey T-60 didn\u2019t disappoint me! The way you can shape the guitar\u2019s sound by turning the volume and tone knob bringing it from single coil to humbucker is such a great and unique experience. The body is heavy made of ash with a natural finish, the neck is slim and very comfortable. I\u2019ve just strung it with a fresh set of Ernie Ball Slinky 10s. This guitar has scratches and some dings around the body and neck which I didn\u2019t find to affect playability. I tried to portray on the pictures the more accentuated ones. The pickguard has two cracks but it sits on the body without issues. The most important flaw to point it out on this guitar, which is such a great added feature on this model is that the phase switch is broken and for that reason I\u2019m starting this auction on a lower price point than it\u2019s usually sold. Hopefully someone will buy it for cheaper and have some extra cash to fix it to its full potential. If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate sending me a message. I would be glad to send more pictures from different angles. I\u2019ll ship it in a vintage Yamaha well padded gig bag that looks old but should do a good job protecting it.", "ItemID": "323532684679", "EndTime": "2018-11-10T22:37:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-03T22:37:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-T-60-T-60-Electric-Guitar-Made-USA-Vintage-80-s-Ash-Natural-Read-/323532684679", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Great River, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235326846798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZHIAAOSwKwhb3elo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0gAAAOSwzgtb3elk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kCUAAOSwCtNb3eli/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FIYAAOSw5atb3elb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6eQAAOSwczdb3elg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kC8AAOSwCtNb3elq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JasAAOSwC~db3elX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sB4AAOSwIUVb3elZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tV4AAOSw-pNb3ell/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HzsAAOSwF31b3eld/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qxkAAOSw-ghb3ele/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KnIAAOSwkfxb3elm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11739", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "andjj6", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 181, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 387}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey T-60 T 60 Electric Guitar Made In The USA Vintage 80\u2019s Ash Natural *Read*", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 575, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
