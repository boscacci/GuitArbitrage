{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Hagstrom Jimmy D'Aquisto in excellent conditions. This rare model (in ultra-rare natural finish) was produced in Sweden with the supervision/collaboration of the famous liuther Jimmy D'acquisto in the '70, who personally designed this guitar model. According to what I could trace from serial number (pic #7) it should have been made in 1976. The body is made of beautifully figured birch (laminated?). Ebony fretboard. Birch is quite unusual material for guitars and, combined with the smaller size of the body, it gives to this guitar a rather bright, brilliant and defined sound (e.g.: compared to a Gibson 175). Definitely a very unique and interesting instrument. It has the original Grover Imperial tuners, but I think pickguard has been replaced. Also the plastic ring of the bridge pick up has been replaced. Everything else (including pick ups and electronics) is original. There is a very small crack in the finish (wood not affected) shown at pic #6. There is also a sign of the previous pickguard screw (pic #8). But those are rather normal blemish for a 42 years old guitar. Case is original and in fair conditions. All latches works and can be definitely suitable for normal usage.", "ItemID": "173725067677", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T16:34:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T18:24:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Hagstrom-Jimmy-DAquisto-archtop-guitar-1976-RARE-BEAUTY-Gibson-killer-/173725067677", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Miami Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737250676778080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg5MDA=/z/BOoAAOSwiSVcBETD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/itMAAOSwu4dcBESu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/UwIAAOSwgyZcBETe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/UwcAAOSwHjtcBETu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE1ODc=/z/1hsAAOSwkjJcBET8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/HikAAOSwwfFcBEUc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE0NDA=/z/T0QAAOSwRbJcBEUt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4OTk=/z/nAQAAOSwNXpcBEVD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/IcQAAOSwwtdcBEXJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ApsAAOSwGUpcBEXU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/dLUAAOSwWIJcBEX3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33139", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dolnetbari", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 272, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 599}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Hagstrom Jimmy D'Aquisto archtop guitar 1976, RARE BEAUTY!
