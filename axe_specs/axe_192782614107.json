{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is in pristine condition. I wanted to call it \"mint\" but chose \"excellent\" in case there's a scratch or something I didn't see. I was dealing with bad lighting in my house, so some of the pictures have reflections that could be misconstrued as blemishes. I looked over the guitar and couldn't find any problems with the finish. It even still has the protective plastic on the back covers. Everything works flawlessly. I've had this guitar for a few years but never really played it. I bought a Gibson Les Paul Standard, so this isn't getting any love. It comes with a hard case. Don't get this confused with the lower-end WA-200. This is the more expensive version with Seymour Duncan pickups.It sounds great, and this green camo style seems pretty hard to find these days. Here's the official description by ESP:The LTD Will Adler signature WA-600 electric guitar features a set 3-piece maple neck, mahogany body, and ebony fretboard. The thin U-shaped neck with 22 extra-jumbo frets provides comfort and speed. A Seymour Duncan JB humbucker pickup at the bridge and a '59 humbucker at the neck provide plenty of power. ESP locking tuners, a Tonepros T3B-T bridge and T1Z Locking tailpiece keep you in tune and intoned so you'll sound your best. Two volume knobs and a tone knob plus a 3-way toggle give you options for great tone. \"My ESP felt so natural right when it came out of the box. From the first time I played it, this is the guitar that I've been wanting to have for years.\" \u201d Will AdlerFeaturesConstruction: Neck-thru-bodyScale: 24-3/4\"Body: MahoganyNeck: 3-piece mapleFingerboard: EbonyNut Type/Width: Bone / 45mmNeck Shape: Thin UInlays: Stars with flag at 12th FretFrets: 22 extra jumboBinding: Creme (B/N/H)Hardware: ChromeTuners: ESP LockingBridge/Tailpiece: Tonepros LockingPickups: Seymour Duncan JB (bridge) / 59 (neck)Electronics: Vol/Vol/Tone/Toggle", "ItemID": "192782614107", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T17:25:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T22:27:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-Willie-Adler-Signature-WA-600-2007-Green-Camo-/192782614107", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fayetteville, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927826141078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iMMAAOSwmepcMn3G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-ZIAAOSw~sdcMn3M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nD8AAOSwKV9cMn3Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTY=/z/z18AAOSwaPpcMn1n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AhwAAOSwPYNcMn3l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODI=/z/Nn8AAOSwuZVcMn2F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDkz/z/4h4AAOSwHDdcMn1s/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1ODU=/z/a94AAOSwxL5cMn16/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDg4/z/lsoAAOSwEKxcMn2A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1Nzc=/z/624AAOSwgadcMn2C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NDU=/z/9kEAAOSw6IdcMn1e/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "28304", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chaddstein", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 67, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 246}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP LTD Willie Adler Signature WA-600 2007 Green Camo", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP LTD"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["WA-600"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 82, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent: This guitar is in pristine condition.
