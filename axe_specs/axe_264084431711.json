{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "ITEM FOR SALE IS AN SX HAWK VINTAGE SERIES STRAT STYLE GUITAR. THE BODY IS ALDER AND THE NECK IS MAPLE. THE GUITAR HAS NOT HAD MUCH USE AND IS IN GREAT CONDITION. SINCE IT IS A USED GUITAR, IT MAY HAVE MINOR SCRATCHES/SCUFFS, ETC. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINISH ON THE BODY ANGLED TO THE LIGHT, YOU CAN SEE SOME PLACES WHERE THE FINISH COULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED A LITTLE THICKER (NOT A BIG ISSUE, BUT WANTED TO POINT IT OUT). OVERALL, THIS IS A SURPRISINGLY WELL MADE GUITAR FOR THE ORIGINAL COST (BEFORE MODIFICATIONS/UPGRADES). THE GUITAR HAS A GREAT SET UP AND PLAYS EXTREMELY WELL (IMHO). GUITAR COMES WITH AN SX GIG BAG.
