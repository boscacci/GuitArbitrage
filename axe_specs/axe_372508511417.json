{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "c.2007 Godin Exit 22-S:\u00a0The Exit22 features a solid mahogany body and a rock maple neck. The Exit 22 was the first Godin guitar to combine a 24\u00be scale with Godins new 22-fret neck.\u00a0This combination not only produces ultra comfortable feel and balance, it also delivers big in the sound department. Where many guitars tend to excel specifically for distortion sounds or clean sounds the Exit 22 does it all. Monstrous distortion tones are easily dialed in via the Godin humbucker in the bridge, and stinging clean sounds are also at your fingertips thanks to the Godin Single coil pickups in the neck and middle position. The Exit 22 is finished with a semi-gloss finish that gives it a beautiful understated look. \u00a0This guitar is super clean. \u00a0I found one scratch between the bridge and bridge pickup. \u00a0There is no fret wear and the guitar has just received a fresh set of strings. \u00a0Includes a generic gig bag. Guitars can experience slight changes during shipping that may require minor adjustments. \u00a0In addition, I can not predict how you like your guitar set up.", "ItemID": "372508511417", "EndTime": "2018-11-25T15:56:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-20T20:07:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Godin-Exit-S22-Electric-Guitar-w-Squier-Amp-/372508511417", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Brunswick, Maine", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3725085114178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y9EAAOSwC~9b9GqV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UzsAAOSwKwhb9GqD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8GMAAOSw8PJb9GqT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Y8QAAOSwC~9b9GqH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tlwAAOSwQqZb9GqF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FHYAAOSwBMpb9GqN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DlsAAOSwhwlb9GqR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YXcAAOSwHGxb9GqA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/Nm0AAOSwmUFb9GqL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/12cAAOSwWrxb9GqJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k4QAAOSwNX1b9GqO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9pMAAOSw2~Nb9GqX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "04011", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wisechildadvantage", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 2, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 248.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 248.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 804}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Godin Exit-S22 Electric Guitar w/Squier Amp", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Godin"]}]}, "HitCount": 84, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Charity": {"CharityID": "302", "CharityName": "American Red Cross", "CharityNumber": 3843, "DonationPercent": 10.0, "Mission": "Help people affected by disasters big and small.
