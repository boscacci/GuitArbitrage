{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "*** PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A 5 DAY AUCTION *** for a 1976 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Tobacco Sunburst ALL ORIG w orig case 38 yr owner. Selling only due to medical debts. I bought it used at a music store in Mississippi in 1981. Have played it from S La to Nashville TN back in my 20+ years with 3 bands gigging. Have done nothing to it except keep the truss rod where I like it and change strings. Has a very few dings see photos. In interest of honesty ... there is a very slight right twist in the neck see photos. Been like that since I bought it, but it does not affect how it plays. The frets were filed down sometime before I bought it see photos, so action is very light. Orig case very road weary see photos. Hate to let it go but that's life. There is NO RESERVE ... BUT I AIN'T GIVIN IT AWAY! Feel free to contact me with any questions. SHIPPING VIA INSURED STD GROUND WILL OCCUR WITHIN ** 7 DAYS ** OF CASH IN MY HANDPAYPAL PREFERRED CONTINENTAL USA ONLYNO REFUNDS OR RETURNS ... SALE IS FINAL ----- Good Luck and HAPPEE BIDDING ! On Jan-21-19 at 15:22:02 PST, seller added the following information: Remembered something ... the white knob on the 'pickup switch' is NOT original. Sometime in the past it broke, fell off etc and was lost. The one on the guitar is a replacement ; not sure if it is Gibson part or not. In the interest of honesty of course.
