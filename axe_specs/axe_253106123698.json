{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Today I offer to you my Ernie Ball Musicman EVH model guitar. This is a trans red hardtail guitar. It is serial #84252 and was manufactured on 5/28/1993. It was originally sold to Sam Ash Music in Forest Hills New York. The Ernie Ball rep verified the serial number for me and commented that \u201che has verified very few red hardtails so far.\u201d This is an early production guitar and ONLY 200 hardtails were made in this color! Included in the case is the key for the case. This is a great non-faded guitar with a beautiful quilt and headstock. I have never played this guitar but it looks to have been played but still in excellent condition. It was part of my EBMM EVH collection and has been stored away for many years as I tried to collect all the different colors. Also has the OHSC. These original EVH model guitars are some of the most comfortable and best playing guitars ever made. Now is your chance to become part of the family or add to your collection of EBMM EVH colors. These do not stay for sale too long BID NOW!!!", "ItemID": "253106123698", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T11:53:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2017-08-20T18:05:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ernie-Ball-Musicman-EVH-Signature-guitar-EBMM-/253106123698", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Wayne, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2531061236988080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fWcAAOSwTZtZmc6E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM4NFg1MjM=/z/bZIAAOSwm2xZmc6c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQxNVg1MjM=/z/B3UAAOSwCotZmc64/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTY3WDU3NQ==/z/ujIAAOSwDehZmc8X/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "07470", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bbrwalt", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 547, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "x***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 118}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ernie Ball Musicman EVH Signature guitar!!
