{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Please READ entire ad, see pics for condition, and ask ALL questions BEFORE purchase! Thanks! This is my most excellent 1989 Squier Stratocaster By Fender E Series guitar with a Black finish. These Korean made HM/Contemporary styled strats were made with quality and care from leftover parts after the move from Japan and are on a level completely of their own. Features maple neck, 21 frets on a rosewood board, HSS pickup setup with 5 way switch, master volume and 2 tone controls and a Licensed Floyd Trem (no whammy bar). My guitar is in wonderful shape with only light signs of wear from the past 29 years; just some light scratches (particularly on the back) and smaller dings. No case.
