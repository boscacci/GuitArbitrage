{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ok, where to begin...? This poor phoenix has risen from the ashes into a KILLER playing Paul copy from the early days of the Lawsuit period from Ibanez. This is the time when Ibanez didn't put a logo on certain models, so that the distributors and stores could add their own. Now this particular model, the 2398, was meant to have a flame maple top, and black binding. Typical for that time period in Japanese copying. That being said...\u2026 Sometime in this poor babies past, some moron got a belt sander, a can of white house paint and a brush, and decided to refinish her. The binding and most of the flame veneer were taken off with the sander, and the white latex house paint was sloppily applied with a brush. EVERYWHERE! The body, maple fret board, frets, headstock, neck, name it, it was white, and covered in brush hairs. Luckily, they didn't know about roughing up a clear coat to make the paint stick to the maple neck, so that was easy enough to carefully scrape off. The body however, well, it needed to be filled in, primed, painted and has 10 coats of semi gloss applied. Is it a perfect finish? Not by any means, but it looks like a cool Studio copy from 3 feet away! The pickguard somehow managed to escape the paint brush, but still has some droplets. I left them there as a kind of memorial to it's poor tortured past. All of the parts, minus the 2 back plates, 1 pot, and the nut are completely original to the guitar. The pickups, Maxons I believe, are original, the one pot that was replaced is now a push/pull to make it in/out of phase. (Originally the pickups were wired out of phase in the middle position. Nice tone, but not for everything, hence the push/pull.) Action is nice, frets have a lot of life in them, and the overall tone of this, is closer to a 335 then a Paul due to it's semi hollow design. There may be a few more little dings and scrapes that the pics don't show, but it's 45 years old, you expect that, don't cha?
