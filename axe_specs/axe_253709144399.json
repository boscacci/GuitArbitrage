I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Korean made Squier Bullet strat in Gloss Red finish. As far as I can tell guitar is all original and looks like it has never really been played. The maple neck has near zero fret wear and feels great. There is one small indentation on the side of the round part of the headstock. The very cool body has only mild surface scratches. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting, clean or with some distortion. Tremolo works great on this one. Action is good and guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. It's getting harder and harder to find these guitars in this good of condition. Comes with a Fender gigbag. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period!
