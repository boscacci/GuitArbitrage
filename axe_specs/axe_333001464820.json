An instrument that is the result of a lifetime obsession for perfection. An instrument that is the result of a lifetime obsession for perfection.The EVH Wolfgang guitar is the result of two years of painstaking research and development, and a year of intense road testing. With every minute detail upgraded to the highest standards, the EVH Wolfgang has been built to Eddie's precise specifications, and has features exactly like the Wolfgang guitars he records and performs with. The EVH Wolfgang is constructed with a distinctive double-cutaway body comprised of an arched AA maple top on a lightweight basswood back, a quartersawn single-piece AA bird's-eye maple neck loaded with stainless steel frets, custom-wound double-potted guitar pickups, five-piece binding on the matching body and headstock, custom-made signature tuning machines, Floyd Rose double-locking tremolo with the patented EVH D-Tuna drop-D tuning system, and Bourns low-friction pots. Another innovative Eddie-designed modification is the reverse-wired 3-way pickup toggle switch: the up position (normally the neck pickup) is the bridge pickup, down (normally the bridge) is the neck pickup.
