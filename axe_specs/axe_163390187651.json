{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "uper cool Burns Steer from the first run of reissues of the '79 prototype guitar. There's nothing out there quite like this. It plays like a hardtail strat, but gets both tele and LP Junior tones and has a chambered body that allows for semi-acoustic tones. One of kind guitar, for sure!*******************************************NOTE: The original pickups went microphonic, so it is upgraded to a P-90 (GSF Surf 90). So the coil tap isn't wired to anything*******************************************The guitar is in fantastic playing condition-- it does show it's age.. with oxidation and blemishes mostly in the mirrored pick guard. I think it gives the guitar a really nice patina. There is a lot of wear to the Burns hardshell case, but it's a really unique case and is still good enough to be protective.
