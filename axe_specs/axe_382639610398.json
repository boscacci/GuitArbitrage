{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful Orange Gretsch G5120 Electric Guitar w/ TKL Case. I see no scratches, no buckle rash, no flaws in the finish of this guitar. Plays Great. This Guitar has Never been outside the home. Only very minor play time. Selling because years in U.S. Army Field Artillery have taken their toll - I am now tone deaf. I am the original Owner. The only issue I can find, is the fur lining in the guitar case needs a DROP of glue where the guitar strap peg tends to pull the fur down from the case. (See Photo #9) This case was purchased by me, same day as guitar. It is Awesome. TKL has got to be one of the best, softest cases around. Very Heavy padding. You get what you pay for and in my opinion TKL deserves 5-Stars for sure. Expensive but worth it. The Guitar will need strings and you'll probably want to tune it after that. Please examine the photos carefully for they are the full description of the condition of this listing.The glare on the guitar is a reflection of the chandelier... Salt and Pepper Shakers Not Included. : ) FREE SHIPPING - It will be safely packed and ships via FedEx, the Next Business Day after pay pal confirms payment has been received.
