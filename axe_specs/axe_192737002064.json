{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Really nice DeArmond M77T Solar Bronze guitar. Hard to capture this cool color with a camera. Serial # KC01036202 from 2000. No mods. For my money, these are the best value in rockin guitars that are heavy duty and you can do whatever you want with them, including gigging.These DeArmonds should always be desirable to collectors due to their limited run in the late 90's and ending in the early 00's after Fender purchased Guild in the mid 90's. The american Harry DeArmond pickups, electronics and hardware, along with the well-regarded Korean wood-working, make for an outstanding quality guitar much better than it's price. Other companies soon started using Korea for this reason. There are no apparent flaws on this guitar and it is particularly nice with the Bronze/Gold color scheme while the fit, finish and playability make it shine strong in the Les Paul realm. The Tremolo bar is a stunning option with DeArmond collectors referring to it as the \"Digsby\" which is handy when you're in a surf-riding, wave-bend'in frame of mind.The single cutaway, solid carved chambered agathis body feels very solid. Has carved maple multi-bound top, maple neck, 22-fret bound rosewood fingerboard with block inlay, three-per-side die-cast tuners, four D knobs (two volume, two tone), three-way switch, clear pick-guard, chrome hardware. Similar to the M77 except has a Vibro tailpiece and two DeArmond 2K single coil pickups, which are particularly bright and a 24.75 inch scale . The back looks like solid walnut (I believe) and has a stunning medium dark stain with wood grain features. The white spot in the pic is a reflection, no worries. The comfortable set-neck is maple with an outstanding rosewood fingerboard. Sharp looking MOP type fret markers. Basically all the features the high dollar guitars have are covered here. Great look all around. This M77T model is the Deluxe version of all the DeArmond rock'in guitars, (it's little brother is the M75), and comes factory equipped with the easy working DeArmond Tremolo . This versatile guitar is good with rock, blues, grunge, surf, mav or metal. It likes it. Super fun to play and show with a very cool stage presence if that's where your headed.Very nice hardshell case included. Private player/collector who only buys best condition available first and foremost. To enjoy. USA Ship only. Professionally packed for extra safety. Buy with confidence. See my 100% feedback rating.
