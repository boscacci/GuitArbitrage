{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "One piece mahogany top, 2 piece back, beautiful oil finish, handmade by a luthier. Quality hardware, Seymour Duncan pickups (SPH90-1B Phat Cat bridge, STR1 Vintage neck), sturdy and straight quartersawn maple neck with a medium V feel, rosewood fingerboard. Really a nice one of a kind instrument. The P90 bridge pickup with definitely get you a different sound that a standard Tele, and with the adjustable pole pieces the volume from string to string is more even. The neck pickup is on the darker mellower side. Standard 3 way switch. Also has a notched no load tone pot to let the pickup signal straight through when all the way up for a brighter sound. The one cosmetic issue is that some of the wood by the neck screws has chipped off. I took the neck off to see if it was a problem with the neck joint. The pictures I took will show you clearly that the body and neck joint are solid, no issues, and that the cracks are surface only. I can send you more pictures of that if you are at all concerned, but again, it's just a visual issue. The intonation and action have been set up, the truss rod works, and the roller bridge is set so the strings go directly over the pole pieces. You do have the option with this style of bridge to widen or narrow the string spacing if you like. Weight: 6lbs 6 ounces Scale length: 25.5\" The stand is not included. I do have some guitar cases laying around. If you need one, let me know. I'll see what I have and give you a price. Feel free to ask any questions. This is not a big manufacturer's instrument so I understand the need for inquiry. I'm mainly a bassist, but I'll do my best to answer your curiosities.
