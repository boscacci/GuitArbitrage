{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are view a set of reissue Gibson brand 70 LP Deluxe mini Humbucker pickups bright and focused...they were pulled from 2012 Gold Les Paul Deluxe, they are in near mint condition and include mounting plates, they were removed in perfect working order to install Seymour Duncan P-90s as are a perfect retro fit and it was what the owner wanted. The background information on this pick up is: \u201cThe introduction of the mini humbucker in the late-1960s served a growing need \u2014 the demand for a P-90-sized pickup with no hum. Gibson\u2019s world-class engineers set about creating a smaller, more compact humbucker to fit into the slot of a P-90. With its smaller size, narrow magnetic field, and unique design combination, the mini humbucker produces a bright and focused output, while still retaining Gibson\u2019s famous humbucker performance. The mini humbucker was first made available in several Gibson-made Epiphone models of the late 1960s, and the Les Paul Deluxe in 1969. Today, it is best known as the pickup in the Gibson Firebird, and is a vintage replica of the original mini humbucker with bar Alnico II magnets. The Gibson mini humbucker is authentic in every detail, from its cream-colored plastic mounting and coated enamel-like wire, to its maple spacers and vintage braided lead wire. The tone is unmistakable Gibson. The mini humbucker is available for the bridge or neck position, and is equipped with braided, two\u2013conductor wiring and fully wax potted to eliminate microphonic feedback.\u201d This is a USA auction only to the 48 continental states.
