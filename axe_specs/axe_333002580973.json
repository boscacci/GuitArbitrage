{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Martin?s E series electrics were produced in two broad series, the 18 series (E-18, EM-18 and EB-18 bass) and the 28 series (E-28 and EB-28 bass). All the Martin labeled instruments were made in the USA. The 18 series was Martin?s first solid electric guitar, and was designed by Dick Boak. Unusually, a new 4-digit serial number was used for the 18 and 28 series instruments, starting at 1000. The first production instrument shipped was an EM-18, serial number 1004, in December of 1978. The last was 3645, an EB-18 at some point during 1980. A total of 341 E-18?s, 1,375 EM-18?s and 874 EB-18?s were manufactured, a total of 2,590 instruments. I am selling a few guitars for friends and will be listing them over the next couple days. Plese check my other auctions to see everything that's available. I have a long history on eBay with a 100% positive feedback profile. I've been here since the start around 1999. I ship fast and secure. It will be packed by me personally and fully insured to protect your investment. Should the carrier loose or damage the guitar, I will file all claims necessary to guarantee a full refund. Check my feedback and bid with confidence. I buy as much as I sell or more, so I understand how important it is to provide accurate discriptions, be easy to contact, ship quickly and securely. I am not a business, just a player who in order to enjoy music, must buy and sell at times to help support my hobby. So, please do your homework and know that this is the guitar you want. No returns please. If it arrives not as discribed due to mishandling, the buyer must pay for return shipping. Paypal is preferred for payment or please contact me before bidding if that is a problem. Bidders with excessive negative feedback will get their bids cancelled. You can trust my feedback. I really enjoy selling on eBay and meeting other musicians.Item Better than described!
