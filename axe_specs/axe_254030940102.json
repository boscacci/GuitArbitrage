{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1968 Teisco May Queen - Black This is a rare 1960's Collectable Japanese Guitar. All the electronics work as they should. The top of the headstock was repaired. The guitar shows a few scratches & nicks as shown - otherwise this is very nice, showing little play wear, neck is straight, frets & the fret board are in great shape, with a thin neck profile and low action. This \"Artist Palette \" body shape ranks as one of the most aesthetically interesting creations of the 1960's designed when the Guitar market was starting to falter in the late 60's and innovative shapes were brought out to try to increase sales. Teisco ultimately was discontinued in the US market in 1969 a year after these came out, making this one of the last of the Teisco Branded Guitars sold here in the 1960's. Comes with recent gig bag.", "ItemID": "254030940102", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T16:25:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T16:25:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1968-Teisco-May-Queen-/254030940102", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Dallas, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540309401028080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/wXkAAOSwjMtb7uSS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/wQ4AAOSwIbtb7uSU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/VWMAAOSwkXFb7uSW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/L9IAAOSwTDpb7uSY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/RbQAAOSwC45b7uSa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/qCsAAOSwwSJb7uSc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/drwAAOSwIKNb7uSe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/Wn8AAOSwF31b7uSf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "75240", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jimr98", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 964, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2168}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1968 Teisco May Queen", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Teisco"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["May Queen"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 23, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 609.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very Good condition.
