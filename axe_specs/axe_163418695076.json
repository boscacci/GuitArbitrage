{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "On offer is a superlative Eastman jazz/blues guitar, the AR605CE. This guitar is a wonderful balance between warm jazz and blues, yet harmoniously complex that is addictive..leaves finding other guitars almost 2 dimensional! A big boast I know, but it definitely is on par with much more expensive jazz guitars worth 1000's more! Comes out in a hard case and certificate of authenticity. The guitar is in good condition and has been checked out thorougly. No cracks, No bad fret issues, no structural problems. It has a little bit of finish (nitrocellulose) crazing in the nitro finish (which is common for this type of finish) but nothing you can see unless you hold it up to the light and look sideways, otherwise ready for gigging, or enjoying at home without any problems. Electronic, the Tone and Volume knobs (which are slider wheels under the pickguard) work perfectly and the Eastman/Kent Armstrong pickup is good enough to not have to replace. Easy to play, not overly large and slightly thinner than some jazz guitars make this one of the most perfect jazz guitars around (especially for being under $2000) Here are the specs: Specs Neck Material:MahoganyFingerboard:RosewoodFingerboard Radius:12\"Neck Profile:Traditional Even CNut:Bone 1 3/4\"1st Fret String Height:.022\"12th Fret String Height:Bass .078\" & Treble .062\"Fretwire:22 Medium Jumbo Jescar 47104Scale Length:25\"Body Style:VenetianBody Dimensions:16\" X 3-1/4\"Body Top:Solid SpruceBody Back/Sides:Solid MahoganyTruss Rod:Single ActingBinding:Top, Back Fingerboard, HeadstockBinding Material:Ivoroid(top)/Black 3 ply.Logo:Pearl HeadstockFinish:NitrocelluloseHardware Color:GoldPickguard:Rosewood w/ Ivoroid BindingTailpiece:Rosewood on BrassBridge:Adjustable Rosewood BridgeTuners:Pingwell RM-1271 Neck Pickup:Kent Armstrong HJGS6Pickup Height:3/32\"Capacitors:0.047\" OhmsPotentiometers:500k Linear ThumbwheelOutput Jack:Switchcraft Strings:D\u2019Addario NYXL .012 - .052Case:Hardshell Case", "ItemID": "163418695076", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T23:29:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T04:59:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Eastman-AR605CE-Hollow-body-Jazz-Blues-guitar-Complex-Rich-Jazz-tone-/163418695076", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cornubia, QLD", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634186950768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jyAAAOSw11BcCf0v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gTAAAOSwFGNcCf09/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~mkAAOSwSudcCf1E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lzgAAOSw5iRcCf1U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dlcAAOSwTxJcCf0o/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JLIAAOSwgyZcCf1N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e-EAAOSwteNcCf0h/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vBIAAOSwF1tcCf0M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MpwAAOSw~flcCf0F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y6QAAOSwXI1cCf0V/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Nj4AAOSwPWtcCf0c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KfEAAOSwrpJcCf02/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "4130", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fourowls75", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1059, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 816.98, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1140.0, "CurrencyID": "AUD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 35}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Australia", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Eastman AR605CE: Hollow body Jazz / Blues guitar: Complex Rich Jazz tone: ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Eastman"]}, {"Name": "Body Colour", "Value": ["Antique Violin"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow-Body"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["AR605CE"]}]}, "HitCount": 414, "Subtitle": "Excellent value and 1/2 price.
