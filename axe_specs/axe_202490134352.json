{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1957 Gibson ES 225. Made in USA.Nearly all original in that the guitar comes with the original pick guard, original bridge, 5 of 6 original tuners (a set of six tuners, original owner replaced one; I replaced them all with Waverly tuners). All are pictured. NO extra holes were made in the head stock. The Waverlys fit the original holes perfectly. Frets have been replaced. Original, worn frets are included (not pictured). Some cracking beneath the surface of the nitro, as expected with a 60+ year-old-guitar. The neck is smooth. No neck or head stock cracks of any kind. Every fret intonates. There has been no reset. P-90 is original. All electronics and knobs are original. Binding is original and has no breaks whatsoever. Non-original hardshell case is a bit worn but solid with cool purple interior. All latches work, no key for lock though. Nut is replaced. Everything works well. Truss rod works. No issues whatsoever. Very good condition. 60+ years oldNo buckle rash, but has small dings and nicks as you might imagine. I tried to picture them, but they are small. Guitar has been cared for. Some slight pick scratches. It's been played. Has stamp inside f-hole that reads \"es 225.\" I tried to capture it but it doesn't really show (kinda shows in the first f-hole picture). I've set the opening bid at the absolute lowest I'll accept. If only one person bids then that bid wins, but the Buy It Now price is a bargain. For sale within the continental USA only. NO RETURNS. I've described the item as accurately as possible and provided a number of photos from different angles. I'm a private person, not a shop or anything. These are my personal items.Check my feedback and know you can bid with confidence. Please write with any questions. I'll try my best to answer them.I've guessed the shipping based on experience. If it is less than I've charged for shipping + insurance, I'll refund the difference. The shipping is used to cover the costs. That's all.
