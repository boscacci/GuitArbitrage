{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is an Olympic White 62 Reissue Stratocaster, American made in the Corona factory. The date stamps are from 1994. I purchased this used a long time ago, and it is in mint condition for a reason. I took care great care of it but never gigged. It has sat in my living room in its case for most of the last 20 years, but it has been played fairly regularly. Alder/Maple/Rosewood. Nitrocellulose lacquer. 7.25\" radius. Neck is Nitro, but the back has a satin feel. Comes with everything in the pictures. The pickups are Lindy Fralin Blues Special ($285) with bridge base plate, Fralin volume kit, 5-way switch and a mid boost when the middle tone is set to 10. You can see how it is wired from the pics. I\u2019ve left it this way, but will resolder it to a more stock 5-way wiring at the buyer\u2019s request. It\u2019s currently a more mid-forward sound than stock. When I photographed the pickups I cleaned/lubed the pots and reflowed solder joints. This is a very clean example of an early 62 reissue and I hate to part with it, but it doesn't get the attention it deserves. I will ship via FedEx at buyers expense. I\u2019m open to offers and questions.", "ItemID": "223269064110", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T00:49:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T17:12:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1994-Fender-Corona-62-Reissue-Stratocaster-V07-w-Lindy-Fralin-/223269064110", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Austin, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232690641108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U9sAAOSwdrdcBWIp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/l2MAAOSwEfVcBWIp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cYwAAOSwqRlcBWIq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e~QAAOSwHGxcBWIn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oG0AAOSw9g1cBWIp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NzUAAOSwTEZcBWIn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8gQAAOSw11BcBWIn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zRIAAOSw-V1cBWIm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1wwAAOSwIs1cBWIo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8FkAAOSwo-VcBWIo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Et4AAOSwWH1cBWIp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "78703", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ricks_ian", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 8, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***5", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1994 Fender Corona \u201862 Reissue Stratocaster,  #V07 w/ Lindy Fralin", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1994"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 546, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
