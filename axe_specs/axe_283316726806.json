{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 1973 Gibson SG Standard...IT IS NOT A SPECIAL AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS. This is the 2nd standard I've listed and they keep showing as specials. This is a Standard in cherry finish. There is some buckle rash on the back. See pics..Someone had a stop tail piece professionally installed. However I believe I have all the pieces included if someone wanted to restore it back the way it came. There are visible holes where the bigsby was mounted. See pics..the bridge pickup is not original and I don't have it...the strap pegs are not original but I do have them included..there are lots of little scratches and flaws as this guitar is closing in on 50 years old. But there are no cracks or repairs. It is a solid players guitar. The finish is starting to turn lighter in color and I am pretty sure the fretboard is ebony. Rounded neck feels great to play and the neck is fast with low action. Includes original case that is solid but has some minor issues..I am older now and due to arthritis just can't enjoy playing anymore. Again this is a solid instrument that was built very well. Please ask any questions you might have. Also I don't know if the 1/4 Jack plate is original or not..again please see pics..No refunds. Sold as is and guaranteed in good playing condition. Here's a chance to get a vintage Gibson for a good price.
