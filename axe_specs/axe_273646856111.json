{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "PRICED TO SELL! You're watching an 1978 Ibanez Iceman IC200. Originally a brown sunburst but refinished in the late 80's, the plan was to morph into a PS10. I added the mirror bridge plate and had the face jack converted into a power cut / mini toggle. The jack is now on the side. Everything was done professionally. I added Duncans but still have the original Super 80 Flying Fingers pups which of course are pretty rare and also included. The case was purchased when they went back into production in the early 90's. Case shows some wear but in overall decent condition. All that said, for a 41 year old guitar it's in pretty amazing shape. I gigged with it for 5 years and tried to show any wear from use. She's been hibernating since the late 90's when bass duties took over. All the best and thanks for looking!
