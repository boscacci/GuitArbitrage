{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Gibson Les Paul Classic Cherry Sunburst heritage with lots of beautiful gold/brass parts. This guitar is beyond beautiful and plays like a dream. This guitar was professionally customized/setup to look as amazing as it is. The back of the guitar features an extremely nice looking finish. The serial numbers were saved from the original finish to verify that it is a real Gibson les Paul Classic from 1994. The pickups are high quality Seymour Duncan's and the tuners are Grover brass tuners which are beyond exceptional. There is a nice pick guard which goes great with the coloration of the guitar but two other guards come with it as well. This guitar includes all real authentic Gibson parts such as the Gibson Brass bridge, Gibson gold tone and volume knobs, Gibson strap buttons, Gibson gold pick rest, Gibson gold tail piece, Gibson gold toggle switch cover and Gibson gold washer. There is also brass/gold covers that go around the pickup, gold plates on the back of the guitar, and a gold truss rod cover. Plays flawlessly and comes with the original case along with most of the original Gibson parts that were taken off which are all still good to use such as the original bridge and tail piece. Elixir strings are installed on it. There are also many other parts that come with this package. Plays great and looks beyond beautiful. Has some small scratches and usage indicated in the pictures, there is also a small indention by the serial numbers on the back but this doesn't impact anything at all. This also comes with strap locks installed on it and has the original case on it. The pad lock is broke on the case but all the other locks work perfectly.
