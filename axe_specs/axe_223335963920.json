{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar is in real good condition. It feels, plays and sounds great. It has a lot of tone! It's 100% original. I have more pictures so just ask and I'll send them to you. There are a couple of nicks, a minor blemish or two. One screw is missing from the truss rod cover on the head. Both volume knobs labels fell off some time ago. Gold plating is slightly fading here and there. But these seem to add to character. Original case is in great condition, inside and out. All latches work as they should. No key though. This guitar is 40 years old. These guitars are definitely appreciating. These early models did not come with the pull/push pots. They also used a process that when mating the solid one piece head to tail neck to the body sides, they made sure to run the grains in perpendicular. This added to the beauty of its construction. I'm only the 3rd owner since 1979. I babied this guitar. I also have an early 80's Yamaha Guitar Catalog that I will include with the guitar. I haven't changed, added or removed anything to it. It's value should continue to climb as does with all well-made vintage guitars. Paypal transactions only. Please, no returns.
