{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale here today is an Ibanez AR500 from the golden era of the late 70s/early 80s. NOT the crappy Artists of the 90s and beyond. I'll leave sorting the exact year to the experts. Full active EQ, the AR500 was among Ibanez' top of the line in the early 80's, apart from some extreme models which added a little more bling. These were pretty rare 15 years ago when I bought this, I can't imagine they're any easier to get these days. Sounds fantastic, and as you can see the build quality is insane. The inlay work has a deep 3D quality to it that doesn't get done justice in photos. This is a decent top for this range, with a gentle orange undulating flame. Very dignified. Pitting on the bridge components is normal for these guitars, and is photographed for your consideration. The parts can be replated if you wish, but I'd leave that up to you. No cracks or breaks. Some buckle rash on the back, and some play scratches on the front which aren't through the finish. Frets have play wear. I didn't refret it, but you may want to. Frets are a personal choice, so I'm leaving that to the one who is going to play the guitar for the next few decades. Some bone head thought it would be a good idea to drill some new strap post holes, which can be seen from the picture of the lower horn. An easy fix for any luthier, but again, the decision on how should be up to the person who has to live with it for the next 20yrs. Non-original hardshell case included. I'm not trying to make any money on shipping, but I've been burned before eating 100 bucks or more in unexpected shipping. If international shipping costs less than my imagined figure, I'll refund the difference to actual cost.
