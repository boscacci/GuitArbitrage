{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a 2005 Paul Reed Smith Standard 24. This guitar was made in the USA. It is a 20th Anniversary model which has the \"Birds in Flight\" inlays. Has two birds at the 12th fret, which not only looks cool but makes finding the 12th fret really easy! Guitar has virtually zero fret wear. I bought it from a guy a couple of years ago who said he had purchased it new but quit playing due to having kids. The frets were all oxidized so I taped off the fret board and polished them up and they looked brand new. There is a little bit of belt buckle scratching on the back and pick marks on the front, which I tried to show in the photos. One tiny ding on the lower cutaway area. Head stock is ding free and has nice looking gold Paul Reed Smith inlay. Guitar is really nice sounding and easy to play. The PRS pickups sound great whether playing clean or with overdrive or distortion. Guitar weighs in at 7 pounds, 8 ounces. Nice looking, lightweight guitar with a full sound. It has a push-pull tone knob, and a three-way switch. Has the original PRS locking tuning machines. It is currently strung with Elixir nanoweb 46-10 strings, which I prefer over the 42-9s it came with. Case is in good shape except for scratch on the back, which i did somehow. I don't have the key for the lock. Case is heavy. Guitar and case together weigh 24-25 pounds or so. Has some original paperwork and hang tag. Sorry, I don't have the original hex keys for adjusting truss rod and intonation. Shipping weight is 30 pounds. It will be shipped FEDEX Ground or Home Delivery. Buyers from and shipping to lower 48 continental United States of America only. Please check my feedback and buy with confidence.", "ItemID": "153254127812", "EndTime": "2019-01-20T15:35:44.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-10T03:54:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2005-PRS-Standard-24-20th-Anniversary-Model-/153254127812", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lakeside, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532541278128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3RUAAOSwG-xb5ku2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2AgAAOSwcOZb5kvv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/10gAAOSwcOZb5kta/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dBMAAOSwEcxb5ku8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JAoAAOSw-GNb5ku-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BMgAAOSwH0Vb5kvD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Z3oAAOSw0X1b5kvy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2hcAAOSwUalb5kvI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/B4IAAOSwR6Bb5kvH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FuoAAOSwNe9b5kvG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3DEAAOSwrmRb5kvw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NWQAAOSwcnxb5kxx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92040", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "highyucca", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 124, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 179}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2005 PRS Standard 24 20th Anniversary Model", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 606, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
