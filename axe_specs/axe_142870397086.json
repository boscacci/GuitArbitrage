{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Silvertone Fastback Electric Guitar. I bought this guitar thinking I would part it out since I purchased it knowing it didn't function. But it turns out it was just a ground wire so I fixed it and cleaned the pots and fixed the broken toggle switch. I hate parting out perfectly good guitars so I decided I'd fix it since the pickups and neck are good. I set it up and it plays and sounds very good. I used to have an OLP EVH and this thing sounds and plays almost the same and is an obvious copy or similar to a Greg Bennett Fastback. It's neck feels just about the same as an OLP EVH. It has 10 gauge strings and low action. I don't have a tremolo arm for it and no case but otherwise is a solid little guitar. I thought about relicing it like the new Wolfgang Road Worn series but I just don't have the time. It's a little beat up but an nice little ax. Weighs 7 lbs 4 ounces. Buyer pays shipping and I'll insure it. Thanks for looking and check out my other stuff. Any other questions just ask.", "ItemID": "142870397086", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T21:08:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-07-16T17:57:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Silvertone-Fastback-Electric-Guitar-/142870397086", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Ralston, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1428703970868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/~lYAAOSwojhbTNiO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/lwcAAOSwuLZbTNii/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/RAMAAOSw-d5bTNi7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/liQAAOSwAuZbTNjZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/kagAAOSwCItbTNjt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/9WEAAOSwFA5bTNkD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/~LsAAOSwfb5bTNkh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/6lQAAOSw~jJbTNlA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/DHUAAOSwgetbTNlY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/9yMAAOSwgPdbTNlt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/91wAAOSwgPdbTNmM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/CI0AAOSwJRxbTNm8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "74650", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "whaguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 460, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 187}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Silvertone Fastback Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Silvertone"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 2392, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
