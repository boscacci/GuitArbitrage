{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage guitar 1989 Fender Stratocaster PlusAlder body, Maple C shaped Neck, 25.5\" scale, 9.5\" radius, 22 medium jumbo frets, Wilkinson Roller Nut. Fender Hardshell case included. Yes, this guitar counts as vintage. It's 30 years old. What makes it a \"Plus,\" specifically? Factory installed Lace Sensor Gold pickups, a Fender/Wilkinson roller nut, staggered locking tuners, TBX tone control, and a Hipshot Tremsetter. On the bridge you will see the two-point bridge and the brushed offset screw saddles, complemented with black adjustment screws and black springs. This was a time when Fender was stuffing their high-end Stratocaster models with all sorts of goodies, and in addition going for a sleek, streamlined look. The color choice for this Plus model is Blue Pearl Burst, the Fender logo on the headstock at the time was small and silver in color with black outline, and \"MADE IN U.S.A.\" was shown directly beneath \"STRATOCASTER\", all on the front of the headstock. The back of the headstock is blank as this is before the days of putting any decals on the back. The necks feel wonderful on this particular era of Strat. Fender uses satin urethane coatings (and still does) on the back of the neck during this time on the USA models, giving a silky smooth feel. String bunching/kinking absolutely doesn't happen on the Plus due to the roller nut and locking tuners. In fact, the only way I know to get any sort of bunching or kink noises is if you specifically let the strings rust first before playing. Obviously, nobody does that. With regards to the Lace Sensor pickups instead of using pole pieces, they use what they call magnetic sensing fields. Lace Sensor tone is good, it makes for a wonderful stage guitar as it's a lot easier to command a more \"even\" sound. TBX tone control or Treble/Bass eXpander A TBX tone control basically acts like a boost. From a roll of 0 to 5, you get normal tone control. After 5 there is a notch, which you will feel when you reach it when turning the knob. After that notch, resistance is decreased, which provides more treble frequencies, more bass frequencies, more presence and more output - it acts like a boost. In plain English: \"The first half\" is regular Strat tone control, \"the second half\" is TBX-enabled tone control. If you want traditional Strat tone control, use 0 to 5. If you want TBX, use 5 to 10. I can't say it any simpler than that. The main advantage to TBX is that it's all passive. No battery required. A modern Fender that compares to the '89 Plus is the Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster. The \u201989 Strat Plus was a top-of-the-line model for its day. This is seriously a nice good guitar.
