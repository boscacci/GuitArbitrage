{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Eastman 905CE in beautiful tobacco sunburst. All solid woods, carved maple back and carved spruce top. Figured maple binding throughout, even in the F holes. I purchased this guitar new in 2010 after considering American made and other Asian brands. A comparable American made guitar would cost well over $5000, but this instrument is everything you could ask for; easy playing, well balanced up and down the neck, beautiful tone, excellent volume and projection from a 16\u201d body. I upgraded the pickup from the stock Asian produced \u201cKent Armstrong designed\u201d pickup to an authentic Kent Armstrong which I ordered direct. The stock pickup is included. The guitar is in overall good condition with minor fret wear and a few dings/chips I was able to capture in the photos and some light scratches on the bottom from a guitar stand. I\u2019ve owned many high-end guitars and none of them matched this Eastman in quality workmanship and choice materials. It is a beautiful looking and sounding instrument. This guitar is of course suitable for a variety of jazz music, but also sounds great for acoustic blues and Americana. I will include a new set of the strings of your choice with the neck appropriately adjusted and the bridge position marked with tape.", "ItemID": "183613795933", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T16:54:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T16:54:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Eastman-905-CE-Archtop-Jazz-Guitar-/183613795933", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836137959338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzk0/z/NZoAAOSwEmxbxoaR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5Mjk=/z/wS4AAOSwtItbxoaY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ie4AAOSw3qRbxoah/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DmwAAOSwBgpbxoan/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x-wAAOSwhrFbxoat/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~BUAAOSwjXBbxoay/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5ZgAAOSwMvpbxoa4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WzMAAOSw2opbxoa~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MTM=/z/YMwAAOSw6M9bxobM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RbYAAOSwr3xbxobR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "27609", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "johnmiltongore", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 57, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 253}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Eastman 905 CE Archtop Jazz Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Eastman"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["905 CE"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Jazz"]}]}, "HitCount": 148, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
