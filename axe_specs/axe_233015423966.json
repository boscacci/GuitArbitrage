{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Only selling this, because I have been building a \"dream\" idea of a guitar and need to recoup some costs and order a new neck for it. This is a beautiful 2011 Steve Morse Y2D model in a discontinued color. It is a player\u2019s guitar with several dents and scratches on the front and back and some wear on the controls. Additionally, there is a dent on the fretboard below the 3rd fret, but this has not impacted playability. It is a great sounding rock guitar, and has been tuned up with a complete neck cleaning with new wax applied to the back of the unfinished maple neck. There is little wear on the frets.Includes OHSC, which has seen better days, and a strap with Ernie Ball super locks to complement the strap lock buttons on the guitar.The guitar weighs right at 7.5 pounds.Feel free to ask any questions.
