{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Jackson Dinky DK2 Eerie Dess Swirl MADE IN JAPAN. Let me start off by saying that this is one of the finest Eerie Dess Swirl patterns that I have owned and I've owned many. It is high contrast and just plain more vivid than most. Just do a quick comparison to the other Eerie Dess Swirl offerings currently listed here and you will see what I mean. This finish on this guitar is in beautiful condition. You will have a hard time finding one this clean. The frets are very shiny and smooth. Neck is beautiful. The headstock is very nice condition. The tip is not chipped. The neck pocket is clean with no finish cracks. A few very small light scratches on the neck heel that can be seen in the pics. There are only very minor surface marks on the finish but very few. It has Ernie Ball 9s on it. Comes with Gator hard soft Case. Case shows signs some of use but is fully functional and in overall good condition. This guitar is beautiful! I have included High res. pics. Please use the pics, the description, and all stated terms to determine if this guitar is up to your standards and purchase accordingly. Thanks for looking.
