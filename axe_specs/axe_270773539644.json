{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "We have a vintage 1987 Bullet, Korean built (Japanese parts) guitar up for your consideration. Serial number is: E7#####. This guitar \"is\", or will be, a \"great player\". If you know something about Fender guitars, then you know what kind of potential you have here. The guitar has some nicks/dings and scratches through out (natural relic in the making) ... nothing deep or scary. Has some fret wear... just did get broke in (plenty of life left). If you know something about Fender guitars, then you know what kind of potential you have here. These are the very first generation of Fender guitars built in korea. They were built by Koreans with left over Japanese parts. So you get an extremely well built guitar... with electronics that come from Japan and sometimes even America. The neck is real thin and flat... super low action.... Needs a set up (saddles will need adjusting).... the back plated has two extra holes drilled in an apparent quick fix guitar repair on the back plate... by IQ deficient musician or mechanic... I know a few of em', but they stopped there. The next issue is the tuners are non original... but they didn't drill extra holes in the headstock(yes). The top line of the tuners are empty of screws and screw holes. (the bottom line of screws are there and holding) So this will need to be fixed to make right! Got some tuners laying around? The last issue is a cosmetic one, the pickguard near the truss road cover has had a paper repair(1/2) inch long... see pic.... not a bad fix- to the naked eye (2 out of 3 ain't bad). Also, I do see some finish cracks in the neck pocket... non issue. Comes with gig bag. Same day shipping! Here comes my standard disclosure statement: For all my foreign friends, you must contact me first, unless you have dealt with me before, to discuss shipping cost. You also need to know how the process works, all the extra customers fees and taxes are your burden. Shipping will be anywhere 65.00to 85.00. Because each player has his on desires of how an instrument should feel, I will always try to explain the essence of the particular guitar, knowing that most players will have them set up by their techs later. But you'll never get a dud with gstars, that's my promise to you! I will return all positive feedback!", "ItemID": "270773539644", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T17:51:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2011-06-27T16:02:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-SQUIER-BULLET-1987-VINTAGE-MIK-PLAYERS-PROJECT-/270773539644", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Rising Fawn, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2707735396448080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GiYAAMXQMXRQ6Cp9/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8EQAAMXQLNpQ6Dkt/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~8QAAMXQDjhQ6A96/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d1YAAMXQLNpQ6Cgx/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6s4AAOxyHslQ6Dw6/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p3EAAMXQcVNQ6DtU/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MiEAAMXQLNpQ6B1C/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GnoAAOxyqUpQ6C0h/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x4wAAOxySE9Q6CYO/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PMsAAOxyxU1Q6CmL/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/crQAAMXQltxQ6B4x/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xeYAAMXQMXRQ6B3t/$_0.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30738", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "guitar2thestars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 337, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 279.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 279.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER SQUIER BULLET 1987 \"VINTAGE MIK PLAYERS PROJECT", "HitCount": 12893, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "7 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Seller"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
