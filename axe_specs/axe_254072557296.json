{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Greetings! You are bidding on my very cool vintage 1977 Fender Stratocaster in natural maple finish, maple fretboard, fixed bridge (non tremolo) and large headstock. This guitar is all original and comes with hardshell case. It was purchased for $1800 from a boutique guitar store in Brooklyn, NY a few years back. This guitar (like others from the 70s) has some weight to it, and its density brings a deep, gutsy, vintage sound out when you play it. Play this thing through a Fender bassman, and you will stir up sounds from Stevie Ray and other great players. Why am I selling it? A: I am more of a Gibson guy, and frankly, don't have too much room for more guitars...i am downsizing my collection. Also, the neck is a little thick for my small hand. Why am I selling it for so cheap? A: Ideally, i would like to get $1700 for the guitar. The reality here is that 70s strats have a tilt adjuster under the neck. Sam Ash checked it out and said it's at its highest setting in order to bring the action down. The neck itself is stiff. If you bring the tilt down, the action is a bit high. (perfect for slide work!!!) The neck may need a reset or adjustment. So to compensate for this, I am starting the bid at $900. The guitar has some surface scratches, minor dents etc as anyone should expect from a guitar that is 42 years old. Please give my baby a good home and take care of it.
