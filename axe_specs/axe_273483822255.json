{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a 1997 Gibson Custom Shop L-5 Studio in a beautiful Translucent Blue Burst with the original case. This guitar is in very good condition and in perfect working order. There are some light scratches, some finish checking, and a spot on the back of the head-stock that we touched up with lacquer. It was never a crack, but just simply started finish checking around the stinger, so we put some lacquer on it and you can now barely see it. Overall, I would give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 condition. Everything on the guitar is original. The neck is straight with no issues. The original frets are in excellent condition with no wear. The original case is in excellent condition and works great.
