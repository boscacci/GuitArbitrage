{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx only,no post office boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone SG in a Gloss Blue finish with some nice upgrades. This guitar is in really good condition, just light surfaces scratches. I traded out the stock closed back tuners for some nice vintage looking Kluson style tuners [you can still see some of the screw holes left from the old tuners on the back of the headstock]. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice action going on.Then I swapped out the stock pickups for some HMV Black/White Zebra Humbuckers,meter at 8k-neck,15k-bridge.I then added a push/pull tone control so the humbuckers can be split into single coils by just pulling up on the tone control knob. Along with the three way switch this gives you six different pickup combinations. I also upgraded the stock tone control capacitor with a nice Japanese Nichicon film capacitor . Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. Neck shows zero fret wear. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. IF YOU LEFT CLICK YOUR MOUSE ON ANY OF THE PICTURES THEY WILL ENLARGE FOR A BETTER VIEW. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented.
