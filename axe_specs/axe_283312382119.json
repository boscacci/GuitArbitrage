{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is this gorgeous 2004 Fender '52 Reissue Telecaster, left-handed. Original owner, American made, ordered direct from the Fender manufacturer in Corona, CA. I played only a few gigs with it - mainly because this guitar is so nice, I didn't want to get it too dinged up. And since, it's been in the case under my bed, except for every few months I take it out to tune and play a little just to keep her sharp. This is an absolutely beautiful instrument. The blonde wood is as clean as can be, no dings or scratches, the chrome is bright and shiny. The photos don't do justice to this gorgeous guitar. And, hard to find one like this left-handed. And man, can it play. All of the electronics are factory original, I did not change a thing, so it has that original, sweet sound that only an American made Tele can have. Incredibly versatile - plays soft jazz, hard blues, all great. Plug it in, crank the gain, and she'll rock out with the best of them. Tears me up to sell it, but I just don't play it anymore, and it's just not right for an instrument like this to sit in a case, so hoping for a good home where it'll be cared for, loved, and played hard!! Original hard-shell tweed case. All the documentation and paperwork. A baggie of picks and new set of strings included. I will even ship in the original Fender box. Great price for a guitar like this. No reserve. Shipping will be a flat $30 to anywhere in the U.S. (trust me, actual shipping will be way more than $30). Sorry but I will not ship international, so no international bids accepted. Wonderful gift for that special someone. This guitar will treat you right and last you a lifetime. Check out my feedback and bid with confidence. Thanks for looking and Happy Holidays!! All Kinda Stuff is an individual seller, not a major corporation or huge retail mega-store. Kinda like a garage sale -- just a guy selling good stuff to good people at good prices!", "ItemID": "283312382119", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T05:09:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T18:17:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-52-Reissue-American-2004-Left-Handed-Lefty-Hand-Gorgeous-/283312382119", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Orange, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833123821198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/5csAAOSwujJcBWxy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/P4kAAOSw3T5cBWx0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/nlkAAOSw6dhcBWxs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTM0WDc2OA==/z/RPcAAOSwyPFcBWxw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg2Mjk=/z/n5UAAOSwHhFcBWxv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg1ODM=/z/cl4AAOSwC85cBWxt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/tgUAAOSwwPdcBWxj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/MhQAAOSwIbtcBWxq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/6f8AAOSwE9pcBWxl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/CvAAAOSw3MhcBWxp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDY4WDEwMjQ=/z/ZnEAAOSwPVFcBWxn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/a~AAAOSwN5hcBWza/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "92869", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "allkinda_stuff_4sale", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 230, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1080.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1080.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 612}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster 52 Reissue American 2004 Left Handed Lefty Hand Gorgeous!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["52 Tele"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blonde"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Left Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 67, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
