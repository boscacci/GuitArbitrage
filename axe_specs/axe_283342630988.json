{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1964 Silvertone Teisco TG1 Electric Guitar Vintage 1964/65 Silvertone TG-1 (aka model 1487) manufactured by Teisco Del Ray of Japan for Sears was the first guitar to have a built in amplifier! The amp provided 1/2 watt output to a 4 inch speaker. Models sold by Teisco had dual cutaway, came in different colors & hardware configurations. Models branded for Sears were single cutaway & chocolate brown in color. Appears to have had a short run of 1 year based on available information. These are quite rare & usually the amp is not working. The one depicted here with its brushed metal pick-guard is missing the battery pack and backplate, and the volume knob is cracked. Since the battery pack is missing, I do not know for certain if the built in amp works or not. Original Silvertone strap included as pictured. I do not have the original case, but it will ship securely in a gig bag, and sturdy guitar box. For a 50+ year old guitar, overall it is in pretty decent shape, and could make a great restoration project for collectors.Please look over pictures carefully for more details of condition.This guitar will ship FREE AND INSURED!Kentucky residents pay 6% sales tax.", "ItemID": "283342630988", "EndTime": "2019-01-17T22:40:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-17T18:12:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1964-Silvertone-Teisco-TG1-Vintage-Electric-Guitar-/283342630988", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Ashland, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833426309888080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1N1g4ODM=/z/NeQAAOSwN3NcLkdZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/8VIAAOSw8L5cLkdJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/J88AAOSw6hNcLkdL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/Q6cAAOSwtvZcLkdN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/KycAAOSwVP5cLkdP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/DMQAAOSwr7ZcLkdR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/k3QAAOSw-4JcLkdS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/Q7AAAOSwtvZcLkdU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/GeMAAOSwYPNcLkdW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/m0MAAOSwSidcLkdY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/QUAAAOSwMd1cLkdb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/LOQAAOSwVH9cLkdc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "41101", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tjjeep44", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5118, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.5, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1916}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1964 Silvertone Teisco TG1 Vintage Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Teisco"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1964"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 22, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=9581458", "StoreName": "TSPJ Tools Sporting Goods and More"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
