{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I\u2019m selling a 2007 custom Carvin DC200C. This a beautiful custom-ordered guitar with a purple, flamed maple neck and mahogany body; a ton of custom factory additions, which make this guitar play like a dream; and accompanying Carvin case, Planet Waves strap, pickup instructions, and allen wrenches. Unfortunately have spent much of the last few years traveling and not playing, so am selling to find an owner who will give this guitar the love it deserves. Overall great condition! Very minor wear, consistent with a guitar less than a year old. Planning to clean and repost pictures asap. I\u2019m a guitar player and music lover who takes extremely good care of my music equipment. I also know what it\u2019s like to win an item on Ebay and eagerly await shipping, so make a point of handling within same to one additional business day of receipt of payment via paypal. Will be shipped via UPS. Shipping a guitar can typically cost up to $100-150 - I\u2019ll absorb the cost. Will ship within the continental US only.
