{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This an Alembic guitar in which I am the original owner. It has a replacement tremolo, not the original. The guitar has been stored in an attic in New Hampshire and a basement in Mass. with no heat so as you can see in the photo's there are finish cracks. They are NOT through the body.Someone that would want to give it some TLC would get a great instrument. There is no case. Nearing retirement and it's too good an instrument to be doing nothing. I would be glad to answer any questions and get more photo's if needed. Buyer would pay shipping and would pay return shipping if not satisfied. I'm a guitar player and would not want a fellow guitar player to be unsatisfied with a piece of crap.", "ItemID": "283310226500", "EndTime": "2018-12-23T20:54:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T22:02:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Alembic-Guitar-Used-late-80s-early-90s-pictures-tell-story-/283310226500", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Estero, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833102265008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDM2MA==/z/F8EAAOSwjkZcGqOA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDM2MA==/z/F~gAAOSwlAFcGqOH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwMFg3ODg=/z/SDQAAOSwxFVcGqOM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDM2MA==/z/EGMAAOSwpTBcGqOR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDM2MA==/z/7-8AAOSwyTtcGqOX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33928", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lgardino", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 17, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2779}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Alembic Guitar Used late 80's or early 90's the pictures tell the story!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["tremolo replacment"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Dean"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["ZX CBK"]}]}, "HitCount": 186, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1324.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "70299955", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
