{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You are looking at a 2011 Music Man Silhouette Ball Family Reserve. It has been customized by adding a pickguard that completely changes and improves the appearance of the guitar. It has an amazing \"black sugar\" paint finish that is almost completely invisible from a few feet away but upon close inspection is a deep metallic sparkle that has to be seen in person. In addition the guitar comes with a roasted maple neck that is highly figured and beautiful. This guitar was customized by GURU Guitars in Raleigh, NC. This included the construction and installation of a custom pickguard as well as 3 Seymour Duncan pickups. The neck pickup is a special order Seymour Duncan SINGLE COIL in a humbucker case. This is a factory Seymour Duncan pickup. Note the single row of magnets. High output.The middle pickup is a Seymour Duncan mini-humbucker.The bridge pickup is a high output Seymour Duncan with alnico magnets.This guitar also comes with a VERY RARE Ball Family Reserve Case. Please note photos. These are impossible to find.", "ItemID": "273636806112", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T22:33:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-02T21:08:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/CUSTOM-Ernie-Ball-Music-Man-Silhouette-BFR-Ball-Family-Reserve-Roasted-Maple-/273636806112", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Apex, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736368061128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ3Nlg1MDE=/z/TIYAAOSw~flcJo1I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JmMAAOSwAx9cJonn/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wuEAAOSwKOZcJonk/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/drwAAOSwN3NcJoni/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qmoAAOSwEfVcJong/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k1IAAOSwYUZcJond/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OMMAAOSwtcRcJowy/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gyoAAOSwIr5cJonZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8kUAAOSw5wJcJo3Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v~QAAOSwXI1cJons/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X-MAAOSwa1hcJonv/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4xcAAOSwsPNcJon0/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "27539", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mccggg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 302, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 187}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "CUSTOM - Ernie Ball Music Man Silhouette BFR Ball Family Reserve - Roasted Maple", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ball Family Reserve"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Music Man"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Silhouette Special"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["Comes with RARE BFR Custom Case"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Custom Pickguard with 3 Seymour Duncan pickups professionally customized by GURU Guitars in Raleigh, NC.
