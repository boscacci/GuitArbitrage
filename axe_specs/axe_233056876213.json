{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Wonderful sounding solid guitar with a great playing neck. Unique hand carved Phoenix on the body. Smoke free studio use only. Not sure of actual date of manufacture...wild guess 1998. A few minor cosmetic issues: as shown in pics three small screw holes where I had a guitar synthesizer pickup attached. Other than that the body is in great condition. Also has some crackle when plugging in a jack or moving around too much.. Could be replaced easily enough to eliminate that noise. The piezo pickup gets static when used alone ( this is a common ailment in older models like this one...most people have a new one installed. I just leave it turned down and play through the magnetic. It still has plenty of options with the 5 way switch and tone knobs. Dirt and gritty twang to crisp and biting classic tele voicing. These, to the best of my knowledge, are the only concerns. Someone with basic wiring skills could add a loving touch to this great guitar, and get it up to snuff delivering all the amazing versatility it is capable of. Even with these issues untreated it is certainly playable. Straight, fast neck and good action and well built. Opening bid is well below the value of this axe, some go for 6-8 hundred, so you can get in on a real steal here, and with a little effort invested have a beauty on your hands. I am in the process of moving and am trying to thin out my collection otherwise I would hang on to it.On Dec-21-18 at 17:55:22 PST, seller added the following information: UPDATE:I was informed that the guitar was made in 2001On Dec-21-18 at 17:56:47 PST, seller added the following information: thank you!", "ItemID": "233056876213", "EndTime": "2018-12-26T20:48:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T20:48:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Deluxe-Nashville-Telecaster-MIM-6string-Electric-Guitar-SWEET-/233056876213", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Marstons Mills, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330568762138080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3fwAAOSwoAFcGqy3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mPsAAOSw5i5cGqzI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SqIAAOSw1QNcGqzY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r-YAAOSwxPNcGqzc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qj4AAOSwH61cGqze/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0ZAAAOSwXWhcGqzg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6IMAAOSwPrdcGqzi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~lQAAOSwikBcGqzk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-KMAAOSwRDJcGqzm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nmUAAOSw~2VcGqzo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5KcAAOSwh7tcGqzq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "02648", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "super-perfundo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 270, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 24, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.42, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.42, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 27}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Deluxe Nashville Telecaster  MIM 6string Electric Guitar SWEET", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1998"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Delux"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 834, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 315.42, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
