{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2007 Gretsch Brian Setzer Hot Rod. Regal Blue. Guitar is in near excellent condition for its age. I bought it used 4 years ago. it has been played, has that \"Great Gretsch sound\", so it does have the typical signs of light use on it. No deep scratches, nicks, chips, dings, or buckle rash. The back has what looks like light rub marks at certain angles of light,near the cut-away of the body on the rear (see pictures), hard to pick up on camera. It's just from rubbing on a shirt when gigging. Been there since I had it. Could be lightly buffed out, if desired. I just don't have the equipment to do so, and barely noticeable, anyway. Neck and action are great, very comfortable guitar to play. Bigsby works smooth and easy. It was never abused while in my care,stored in non-smoking home,and only played on gigs occasionally. It has the pinned adjustomatic bridge, \"Hot Rod\" pickguard, Sperzel locking tuners, 59 trestle bracing, special badge on the headstock. All original condtion. Also comes with the original Gretsch hardshell case w/ truss rod wrench, and lock key. Does not have original hang tags/ paperwork /case candy. Only selling due to changing interests. This is one good looking Gretsch that has been honestly described to the best of my ability. (please note: hardware is chrome, some pics may look off color due to lighting). Continental U.S. only. Non-payers or no contact will result in claim filed and reported. Will be shipped after confirmed payment through Paypal. Item will be shipped after confirmed payment.
