{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Steinberger's Gareth tuner is attached, tuning is easy, head does not fall lightly. A strap is attached. Although it is not a special case, I will ship it in strict packaging, putting it in a soft case. There is not much reduction of frets 8-90% left.I do not touch the rod.I think that there is no warp of the neck. I changed the location of the strap pin, and there is a screw trace of the pin made at that time. The sound output confirmation is done. You can use around the pickup and control and jack part without problems.
