{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Sorry, No combined shipping with any other lots. Schecter Hellraiser in excellent condition. Used only in a non smoking studio. Never gigged. I'm not a fan of active pickups so I had a pair of brand new Seymour Duncan SH-1b '59's professionally installed. The Duncans seem to have a light hum to them that I think may be a ground loop issue. I never had anyone go over it again as I have a lot of guitars to play. I'm also including the original active EMG's and pots that came with it in case you want to take it back to what it was. I have over 200.00 just in the new pickups, pots, and instillation cost. I also had a complete set up done and a set of 10-52 strings installed although it could probably use a fresh set by now. Still has original plastic film on the back cover. I'm missing a few screws for that cover but I'll try to locate them before it ships. No case. I'm offering several different shipping options so please make sure to see which one works best for you. Please ask any questions. Payment due with 3 days please. Any payment not received in 3 days will automatically be reported to ebay as an unpaid item.", "ItemID": "123521744648", "EndTime": "2018-12-10T02:00:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T02:00:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Schecter-Diamond-Hellraiser-C-1-w-200-00-Pickup-upgrade-Seymour-Duncan-59s-/123521744648", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Painesville, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235217446488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MjE=/z/SWkAAOSwFURcAxWe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg3NDk=/z/15kAAOSwo-JcAxWh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjI4/z/TscAAOSw1dtcAxWm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg3Mjk=/z/ZLwAAOSwhnlcAxWq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg3OTc=/z/3jwAAOSwoEFcAxWt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg2NzE=/z/sSMAAOSwfMlcAxWv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg3NjI=/z/sdAAAOSwKwhcAxWx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjM3/z/pF0AAOSwEUdcAxW1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4NDE=/z/KwkAAOSwGD1cAxW3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3M1gxNjAw/z/YiAAAOSwhEhcAxW6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44077", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "korrelics", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4439, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 26, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 94}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Schecter Diamond Hellraiser C-1 w/ 200.00 Pickup upgrade Seymour Duncan '59's", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Schecter"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Hellraiser C-1"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["BLACK CHERRY"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Seymor Duncan pickups"]}]}, "HitCount": 324, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=41510628", "StoreName": "Kor Relics"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
