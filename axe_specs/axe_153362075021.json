{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Nice American-made Alamo Fiesta guitar. Here's what I know about it: Guitar comes with original chipboard case (see pics), which has seen better days, but still protects the guitar like it should. This guitar plays OK and the pick-ups have a great tone. Has what looks like a 25\" scale when measured, and intonation is pretty close for a bridge like this. Pickups are wired oddly. The 3-Way PU switch goes like this: Neck PU, Neck & Bridge PU's out of phase, Neck & Bridge PU's in phase. Why you can't get the Bridge PU by itself is a mystery. But both pickups do work though. It has a truss rod that is not adjustable, at least I can't find a way to do it (see pics). The rod looks like it's been plugged (see pics). The neck has a little too much relief for my taste, and unless you can figure out a way to adjust the truss rod, that's the way it'll probably stay, with a bow to it. I've seen way worse bows, but it's there. There's buzzing and fretting out past the 10 or 12th fret, but it's not bad below the 10th fret. The action is medium low to medium. Bridge can go lower if you like, but you'll get more buzzing and fretting out if you do. It's not bad right now. The nut works as is, but probably should be replaced (see pics). It's loose and It's on its last legs, but strangely seem to keep the strings where they ought to be and although pretty ugly looking, is fully functional if you're not too picky. One of the tuners has been replaced (Hi E, see pics), but it does the job. Both Knobs look non-original. Everything else looks like it's all there. The finish looks original and has a lot of mileage on it. It's got the usual battle scars for a 50+ year old guitar - bumps, dings, finish checking etc. Please study the pics carefully, what you see is what you get. Ask any questions before bidding. Guaranteed to work and be as stated here. I am not a store, just a guy with too much stuff, so no returns on this please. I've tried to be as honest as I can about the condition. It's a great little guitar, especially for a 60's instrument. ============================== PayPal only. I reserve the right not to sell to anyone with NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, and those with ZERO FEEDBACK need to contact me first before bidding OR THEIR BIDS MAY BE CANCELLED.
