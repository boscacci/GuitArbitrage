{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson SG '61 Reissue Cherry Red Guitar - 2003 - Hard Case - Excellent (Used) This guitar is used but in excellent condition. It will come with a tan hard case with pink interior that is in great condition. There is still manufacturers' cellophane on the scratch plate. There is a very small indentation between the stop piece and pick-up selector and another very light one next to the auxiliary input. In the glare you can catch some hairline scratches, neigh unnoticeable. The same is true on the back. At the very top of the headstock there is a small nick as well that is mostly unnoticeable. Overall this guitar is in excellent shape, I only mention these imperfections to be clear about everything, but honestly they are really quite small. I would personally rate this a 8.5 out of 10 easily! Please look at the pictures and thank you for your interest!
