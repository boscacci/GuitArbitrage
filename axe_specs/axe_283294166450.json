{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great guitar, just too rocky for me. Built well, plays well... I replaced the Gforce robo alternate tuners with locking Grovers, as my playing style bends a lot of wire and the frequent retuning was a distraction (Gforce system - including battery charger - is included in this listing). You can google the stock description of this guitar on the official Gibson site... I assure you that it is built well and plays well. The vintage satin finish is beautiful... the tiny dimple below the bridge in the pic was present upon delivery. The black portion of the finish on the back and sides tends to show every smear and fingerprint... the smear behind the headstock is from an adhesive pick holder. I also replaced the stock pickups with Lace Hemis, which did not produce the sound I needed and so the stockers were reinstalled. The major issue with this guitar is a design flaw - Gibson got too ambitious and lengthened the neck to accommodate a full 4 octave fretboard, which resulted in significant head dive. I remedied this issue by making an aluminum extension (also included in the listing) for the front strap button, which was necessary to achieve proper balance, and is the reason for the secondary hole in the back of the guitar. I believe Angus Young (ACDC) has his front strap button mounted into the tip of the guitar horn, but his left arm probably has Popeye syndrome from holding the neck up. Also included in this listing is the original gig bag. This and similar guitars listed on Ebay seem to be all over the map on price, so I am selling this item for just enough to pay it off. I have developed a much more versatile instrument which is more suited to my eclectic playing style. Thanks for looking and good luck bidding!", "ItemID": "283294166450", "EndTime": "2018-12-08T00:36:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T15:32:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2017-Gibson-SG-Special-High-Performance-Vintage-Sunburst-LEFT-HANDED-/283294166450", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Parkersburg, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832941664508080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sAcAAOSw9z1cCnxT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gRAAAOSwQwFcCnx2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f-kAAOSweX5cCnyD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jQ0AAOSwlLlcCnyM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "26101", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eddard532890", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 146, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 580.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 580.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 149}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2017 Gibson SG Special High Performance Vintage Sunburst LEFT HANDED", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 55, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 590.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
