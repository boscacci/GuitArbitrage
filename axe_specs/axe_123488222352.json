{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1977 Gibson Les Paul Custom 3 pickup. Guitar has been refinished to try and match an aged Bahama Blue (a color Gibson offered in the early 80s). I bought the guitar from a music store on Reverb as a husk that had been stripped and sprayed in black spray paint. I cleaned it up, finished the back and sides in clear and did the top in blue. The neck is natural and sanded to 2500 so it's buttery smooth. It's not perfect, but the guitar looks good enough and is a great player. You can see holes where there was a different tailpiece that got plugged and there's a few dents in the wood on the top. The back has a section where whoever stripped it went too crazy with the sander on the binding by the neck joint. The guitar doesn't have any neck breaks and it has the original frets with the nibs still in tact. The frets are low, but still have plenty of life and the action is low and smooth. The guitar didn't have a serial number when I bought it, so I painted a stinger on it and was going to add my own serial number, but never got around to it. The guitar is a genuine Gibson and is stamped 1977 in the control cavity. Other indicators to its age are the use of a one piece mahogany back instead of a pancake body, maple neck, norlin era logo, and cutaway shape. The pickups are a dimarzio illuminator bridge, Gibson burstbucker 1 in the middle, and a duncan jazz in the neck. The middle pickup isn't wired up at the moment since I don't use it, but it does work if you wanted to wire it up. Switchcraft switch and jack and all CTS and Gibson pots with Orange drop caps. Wired up like a normal 2 pickup les Paul. Nashville bridge posts with an ABR style bridge. Aluminum tailpiece. Comes with a dimarzio locking strap. Weighs probably around 10lbs, maybe a little more, but I don't have a scale for it. It's heavy, but it sustains and rings out like crazy and is still plenty comfy to play. I don't have a case or bag for it, but it will be packaged well so that it doesn't get damaged. Get a great unique vintage player guitar for a deal!! Lower 48 US shipping only.
