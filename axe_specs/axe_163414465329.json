{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "****** Scroll down for 55 High Definition images and pictures inside ****** Here's a pretty rare 2012 Gibson Les Paul Traditional in a fairly clean and factory original faded mahogany finish. It is in very good condition and has light playwear. These are finished in a super light finish that allows the woods to breath - there's some finish wear on the back of the neck and along the edge where your arm rests. It plays perfectly and has a fresh set up, calibration, new 10/46 strings and is ready to go! The pickups are Gibson '57 Classic PAF and PAF+ - they give you the classic Gibson humbucker sound. She weighs 9.1 lbs. The neck profile is a 60's slim profile and the frets are in excellent condition. Comes with the Gibson hardshell case and COA as seen in the pictures.
