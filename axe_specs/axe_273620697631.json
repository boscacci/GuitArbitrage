{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here's a cool, MIM Strat that is in great playing shape, in overall great looking shape, with the appropriate wear of a guitar played for 15 years. It's got it's share of cosmetic wear, but nothing major, just lots of little, natural wear, just played the way it's supposed to be. This guitar is a great \"player\" as it has had it's share of natural play wear, but in function the guitar is EXCELLENT. The guitar plays like a champ! The action is low and the feel is fast. The frets are in good shape, with very little wear to the crowns, but not major pitting. Frets are 8/10 shape. The neck is straight with perfect amount of relief. The frets are level and there are no weird warps, twists, humps or ramps. The electronics function perfectly with no issues. The guitar is mostly original, and has had it's tuners upgraded to a Schaller locking set. This thing plays and sounds great!
