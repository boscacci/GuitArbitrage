{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is this 2017 MIM Fender Classic 50s Stratocaster loaded body in Sonic Blue. It comes complete as shown in the pics. The electronics are still fully wired and ready to rock! The weight is 6.3lbs. The loaded body is all original, and still has the plastic film on the pickguard! There is a small area on the edge of the pickguard that shows light wear from a truss rod adjustment. There is also one larger issue I want everyone to be aware of. The original owner broke a tremolo arm inside the block. He drilled out the block and also accidentally put a small drill hole in the body! See pics. Currently the tremolo is set up as a hardtail, and works fine in this capacity. If you want to use it as a true tremolo, you will need to replace the tremolo block and acquire a tremolo arm. Still a really cool loaded body as is, and for not much $$ or effort could be fixed back up to function 100% !! Shipping to USA & Canada onlyNo duty or tax to either destination. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "333026069649", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T03:22:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T03:22:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2017-Fender-Classic-50s-Stratocaster-Loaded-Body-Sonic-Blue-/333026069649", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kenora, Ontario", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330260696498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2m8AAOSwg1JcRME-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/adoAAOSwRbpcRMD8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J3wAAOSw1qhcRMFP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JyEAAOSw1qhcRMEJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4tUAAOSw7cZcRMEP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GbgAAOSwQ5pcRMEV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0H0AAOSwEGBcRMEc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ODkAAOSwb15cRMEj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "p9n 1c1", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "strat_parts", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1456, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.9}, "BidCount": 23, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2017 Fender Classic 50s Stratocaster Loaded Body - Sonic Blue", "HitCount": 455, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 205.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
