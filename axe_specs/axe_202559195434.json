{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is the very first Hardluck Kings guitar made, has serial number 100001. It is a gloss white finish with single black binding on the top. It has the early specs, meaning ebony fingerboard, mahogany body and neck, and the brass knuckles inlays fingerboard markers, not just the 12th fret. It is a Les P style body with the cut neck heel for better access to the higher frets, two humbucking pick-ups, two volume and two tone controls and a 3 way switch. It has the logo on the body and the original headstock design. Included is the original Hardluck Kings case, a Hardluck Kings sticker and a Hardluck Kings T-shirt. I purchased this from an artist who received the guitar as an endorsement instrument, but he had a deal with G&H and never used the guitar. I have played it sparingly, never gigged out. The guitar is in like new condition. The case has some scuffs on it, but nothing major or breaking thru to the wood. It has the key and wrenches that came with the guitar new. Please look at the photos and contact me if you have any questions prior to bidding. I only ship to the 48 contiguous United States to ebayers with a minimum of 3 positive feedback.", "ItemID": "202559195434", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T02:11:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T02:11:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Hardluck-Kings-Very-First-1-Bossman-Guitar-HSC-/202559195434", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pasadena, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025591954348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/hAUAAOSwZBRcMrEy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/1YcAAOSws~pcMrFE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/OMgAAOSw-GNcMrFf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDE=/z/4ykAAOSwM5tcMrGI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/jhIAAOSw5xhcMrF2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/XFYAAOSwjQVcMrGf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/3NoAAOSw3GlcMrG2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/bIUAAOSwxJ9cMrHJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/uA4AAOSwjmRcMrHZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDE=/z/SbEAAOSwU65cMrHr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg5MDA=/z/1zsAAOSwgdtcMrIM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91104", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "klufoto", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 24, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 217.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 217.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 954}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Hardluck Kings The Very First #1 Bossman Guitar with HSC", "HitCount": 124, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 220.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
