I also have many more to list and have one other current auction. I am not a company so please be sure you want it when you bid. The Sonex guitars were a range of budget Gibson electric guitars launched in 1980. They were made from a synthetic material called Resonwood, and manufactured with Multi-phonic body construction. There were four models: Deluxe, Standard, Custom and Artist.[1]They replaced the Marauder and S-1 guitars.[1] Like these two instruments, the Sonex took its styling from the Les Paul guitars that had been popular for the previous decades, but using Resonwood instead of mahogany, bolt-on necks instead of set (glued-in) necks, and far less ornamentation.[2]\"The Sonex Multi-phonic\u2122 body is composed of Resonwood surrounding an inner tone wood core. The tone wood core not only acts as the anchor point for the neck, it also adds acoustic resonance and exceptional body resilience. The Sonex body is so resilient, that its structural properties survived extreme testing in temperatures ranging from \u221240 \u00b0F to 180 \u00b0F.\"Thus, the Resonwood was a coating used on a solid, usually mahogany body.", "ItemID": "192730246648", "EndTime": "2018-11-29T23:56:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T23:56:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980-Gibson-Sonex-180-Deluxe-Ebony-NO-RESERVE-Looks-Unplayed-/192730246648", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Saint Augustine, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927302466488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NH8AAOSwKOZb80e-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1wIAAOSw9GVb80e5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q6UAAOSwxZxb80e7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2roAAOSwteFb80e7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iuoAAOSwsqxb80e6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Du0AAOSw5cZb80e7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MwMAAOSwi3xb80e8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Wy0AAOSwvf9b80e9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SmcAAOSwl29b80e-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HZIAAOSwH0Vb80e9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LGsAAOSw21Rb80e-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32080", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bobaroo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 509, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 476}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980 Gibson Sonex-180 Deluxe!
