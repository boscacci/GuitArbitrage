{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Wife won't let me keep two electric guitars. Hate to sell this as I've had it since the late 80's. Probably a 70's vintage. Has amazingly low action. Plays like butter. One of the pots isn't working. Before I got it someone had changed out the pick-ups and put a switch that I'm not really sure what it does other than stop the sound. Neck is straight. No bows. Scratches and a few dings here and there, indicative of a guitar that's been around a long while. It will have to go to a good home because I will miss this baby.", "ItemID": "113450432796", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T05:08:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T05:08:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Cortez-electric-guitar-/113450432796", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bishop, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134504327968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDA=/z/~boAAOSwvfpcCf7w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDEyMDA=/z/oBcAAOSwcs1cCf7w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDA=/z/jYoAAOSwUPVcCf7w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDA=/z/meMAAOSwUu5cCf7w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDA=/z/BkUAAOSwezRcCf7w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "93514", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "plume22", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 305, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 71}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Cortez electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 124, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
