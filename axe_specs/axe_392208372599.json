{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This vintage guitar is in good playing condition. Electronics in good working order. One of the bridge saddles (low E) is non-original, but is similar in design to the original saddles. NO whammy bar included. The case is a Fender form fit case and in very good condition. This is/was my backup guitar and it sounds just like a strat in my opinion. The neck straight. I removed the pickup covers (white) as I liked the way it looked with black pickups. The original white covers will be included. The body has signs of playing with the scratches/dents to be expected from normal use. The neck got dinged at the top edge of the fretboard and I had it repaired and it is not something that affects the playability. (see pics) I replaced the nut with a Tusq nut. The original nut is NOT included. I will ship it in the included case with additional packing and in a cardboard outer box. I will loosen the strings before I ship it.On Jan-06-19 at 03:03:12 PST, seller added the following information: I forgot to mention a couple of things in my description. Number one is that I replaced the original white back cover and pickguard with the tortoise shell covers. The new covers are Fender brand and in my opinion they look much nicer than the original white. I was not able to get the pickguard to fit perfectly and had to drill a couple of extra holes in the body to accomodate the different hole spacing. The screw that is nearest the jack misses completely so I just left it out. I was going to glue in a small piece of wood in the cavity to give that screw something to screw into, but I just never got around to it. Obviously this is not something that affects the guitars playability. Secondly, I added copper lining inside the pickup cavities to reduce unwanted noise.It can be easily removed if desired.", "ItemID": "392208372599", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T05:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T05:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Fernandes-Strat-Sunburst-w-Fender-Hard-Case-/392208372599", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Lincoln, Nebraska", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3922083725998080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/L9EAAOSwnCdcMLWS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/qMsAAOSwLDlcMLWV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/xNAAAOSwjlVcMLWY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/OfcAAOSwwkRcMLWb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/VpEAAOSwE~ZcMLWe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/7vsAAOSwG49cMLWg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/RZsAAOSwZBRcMLWi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/5UgAAOSwrZBcMLWl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/720AAOSw6S9cMLWn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/ieIAAOSwu4dcMLWq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/qWgAAOSwQZVcMLWs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/UksAAOSwUlFcMLWu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "68510", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "twinklin-2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2895, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 140.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 140.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Fernandes Strat Sunburst w/Fender Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fernandes"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["unknown"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 252, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 142.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "AS", "CK", "FJ", "PF", "GU", "KI", "MH", "FM", "NR", "NC", "NZ", "NU", "PW", "PG", "SB", "TO", "TV", "VU", "WF", "WS"], "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Good playing condition.
