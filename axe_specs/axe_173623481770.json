{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This listing is for a USA made vintage Peavey 'Predator', '94 production date. Up front, I don't know much about guitars!! Essentially a USA made vintage 'Strat. It has been mod-ded with a factory built Dimarzo 'True Velvet' pickguard/pup assembly ($175.00+ alone). Its in good condition. Everything sounds clean. No static in the pots or switches. Has a few body hits and some polishing swirls...but appears to be in good condition. The pots are clean, no static. Has some dings and use marks on the body, but nothing too serious. I cant find any grooves or significant wear on the frets. The neck is straight and truss rod works as it should. the truss rod cover is included but needs a longer screw to firmly attached. The hard case is a new aftermarket. It works well but needs a good set up. FWIW, Im only selling this along with a bunch of other gear because health (big C) reasons have shut down my playing. This is a great American made 'Strat'. I wouldn't sell it if could still play. I prefer a USA made stick to the foreign copy, even if it doesn't read 'Fender\" on it. And the factory built pick guard assembly USA built.Please check my feedback....Im hear to pass along good gear.....Ill be listing a number of guits, pedals, amps etc... and various other gear over the next cpl of weeks...W6On Nov-05-18 at 04:57:13 PST, seller added the following information: I noticed for some reason the neck looks darker on my iPhone than my lap top or reality. The neck is light in color, not tinted.", "ItemID": "173623481770", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T01:00:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-05T01:00:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/USA-Peavey-Predator-w-factory-built-Dimarzo-True-Velvet-pick-guard-non-fac-hsc-/173623481770", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cheshire, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736234817708080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3N1gxMTI0/z/boEAAOSwhJNb31FT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/RxAAAOSwv-xb11OY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1OVgxNjAw/z/3kAAAOSwsRVb11-f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk3WDE2MDA=/z/dZ0AAOSwy45b2kCh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/Y6IAAOSwNphb2kFB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pFYAAOSwElxb11f6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/T-4AAOSwHnJb11iT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI3NVgxNjAw/z/-c4AAOSwHGxb11-I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/7hsAAOSwA~1b119w/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIyMVgxNjAw/z/cVwAAOSw4Vpb11~C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUxMVgxMTkx/z/17wAAOSwMxJb2kDw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/kVcAAOSwxOVb11lS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "97419", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hallaction", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1395, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 182.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 182.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 309}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "USA Peavey Predator w/factory built Dimarzo 'True Velvet\" pick guard,non fac.hsc", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Predator"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Factory built Dimarzo \"True Velvet\"  pickguard/pup"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 135, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 185.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "has some body nicks, dings light scratches, shows light use, frets are good, truss rod cover is  included but needs the screw", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
