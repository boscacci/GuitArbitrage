{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "IBANEZ ARTIST AR-300 CS 1981 MIJ Cherry Sunburst Serial #: J814393 Wow! Check out this early 80's Ibanez AR-300 Artist! Cherry Sunburst finish. MADE IN JAPAN. October 1981 Fujigen manufacture. Serial number on the headstock back. Mahogany body w/flame maple top, mahogany neck, factory standard Super 58 neck and bridge humbuckers, Gibraltar bridge, and front and rear tone Tri-switches! It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few marks, nicks, and scratches on it here and there nothing that I found that I would call very significantly major Body binding has a bit aging and yellowing as I usually see on these but is otherwise in very good shape for an Artist of this age. Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the body, headstock, and neck are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Top strap peg was repositioned a couple of times to the body back thus the two plugged extra screw holes. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic as these do! Massive beefy tone and tons of power as the AR-300 is famous for! Sounds awesome and a great player as well! No gigbag. If this is what you're looking for don't miss it!
