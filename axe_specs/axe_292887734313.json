{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Awesome looking, feeling, playing and sounding guitar. Near mint. No dings or obvious scratches. Epiphone Elitist guitars are made in the famed Terada in Japan by skilled craftsman. They are at least as good, and often superior, to their Gibson counterparts. So good, that Gibson asked Epiphone to stop making all but one of their Elitist line of guitars in order to end the competition they were losing. My luthier, a luthier for many professionals and celebrities, confirmed that Epiphone Elitist is superior to many Gibson\u2019s he\u2019s owned. If you've never played an Epipone Elitist Casino, shortly after playing one for the first time you'll understand why it's the only guitar that Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison owned and played on Beatles' records. It's the king of tone and versatility. Paul Weller has one. Gary Clark Jr. too. It covers a lot of musical ground. It also looks drop dead gorgeous. You'll love the light weight and comfortable neck of the Epiphone Elitist 1965 Casino. The Elite series are instruments that approach custom shop perfection. Crafted with premium woods, fitted with American pickups and circuitry\u201d-even American-made toggle switches and Grover tuners--they're made at a special factory devoted to their manufacture where they receive a high degree of hands-on luthier attention. You'll find the Elite 1965 Casino true to the original made famous by The Beatles. A finely crafted, great-sounding, and easy-playing instrument that beautifully blurs the line between Epiphone and Gibson. Includes hardshell case.
