{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Used Dillion DR590A solid body. I got this because I wanted a guitar with P-90s and couldn't afford a PRS or Gibson. Am selling because I just couldn't get past it not having a maple fretboard (I have gotten super picky in my old age). It is in lovely condition and all original except for the straplocks which will be swapped out to the original strap buttons when the guitar is shipped. Sale includes cheap, but functional padded gigbag. Features: Amber sunburst finish Solid arch top maple body Ash maple laminated top Set neck and hand polished frets Original style headstock and Dillion pearl inlaid logo Chrome tulip style die cast machine heads Dillion custom pearl standard fret markers Fixed bridge Two P90 cream soapbar pickups One volume, one tone, plus 3 way switch Made in Korea TERMS & CONDITIONS: 1.
