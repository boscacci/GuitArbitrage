{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ibanez Talman TC620 in a Rare Green color. Serial Number C6086634. The body is near perfect with a few faint spots all of which are reflected here in additional pictures, and they may be able to be buffed out. Loaded with a nice Pearloid pick guard and P-90's, this baby is a rare find for sure. The top of the pickups do reflect some scratches from use but it in no way affects the operation or playability. Keeping Her in tune is a set of Kluson Tuners all in proper working order. I have placed a block of wood in the tremolo cavity for extra tuning insurance. You can use a tremolo bar with the bridge if you like and I'll include one with a white tip that fits the thread pattern, it just doesn't match the body and pick guard set-up. The pick up selector switch and all pots work well and without any additional noise so you can select alternate pickups or use the volume pot live - without a problem. And all of this with a soft case included to keep her safe and secure for shipping. The picture of the head stock reflects something resembling Birdseye maple which is a nice accent. The back of the neck has a satin finish so it is smooth and fast with no stickiness as can be found on the glossy necks. No international offers please as extra charges will be accessed when item arrives in your country.", "ItemID": "273641726586", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T18:15:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T00:56:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Talman-TC620-Unique-Green-w-Pearloid-and-P-90s-Kluson-Tuners-/273641726586", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Valencia, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736417265868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zTcAAOSwpTBcMU9G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j5wAAOSwUm5cMU9q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pn0AAOSwVNNcMU-A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nvYAAOSwuNNcMU-T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Hw4AAOSwvytcMU-l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/osMAAOSw8DpcMU-8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nfkAAOSwcZ1cMU~U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I4UAAOSwW~JcMU~y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s5AAAOSw2xlcMVAB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/c-gAAOSwEKxcMVAd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lTgAAOSwTDpcMVFY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QSYAAOSwckVcMVFw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "91355", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "garysgreenguitar", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1584, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 429.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 429.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1505}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Talman TC620 - Unique Green w/ Pearloid and P-90's - Kluson Tuners", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Talman"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["TC620"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 32, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
