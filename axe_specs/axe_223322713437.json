{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Cleaning out some equipment trailers and my work bench. This is a Washburn RS-8V guitar I got from a pawnshop with intentions of refurbishing but never got around to. Comes with a hard case, not a great case but it will work for shipping. This is one of 1,100 of these made by Washburn back in the day. Aged pearl white paint, EMG select pickups and Washburn 600T tremolo with a set neck and chevron inlays. It\u2019s dusty and dirty, there is some broken paint by the input jack and a finish crack at the bottom back of the set neck. Also before my ownership there was a hole drilled for a strap button on the lower horn. I plugged it in and it sounded good but the electronics are dirty and scratchy, they need to be cleaned. Please use the pictures for part of the description, enlarge them, blow them up, take a good look. If you are looking at this guitar I\u2019m assuming you are familiar with this model. I bought it because it appears to have all the original parts and still seems very solid. The top few frets show wear and could use a dressing or replaced. This has been sitting around here too long and I\u2019ll never get to it and hate to see it waste away. These are awesome guitars and if you ever wanted to build on one your way, this guitar is for you. That being said, this is a used item and may take some knowledge, work and love to make it fit your playing style and operate as intended, no guarantee is given or implied, I will only ship to the lower 48 states, and I will ship promptly.
