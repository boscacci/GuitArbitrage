{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "USA Auction Only! This is an excellent condition 2014 Charvel So Cal Super Stock 1HH Guitar in the RARE Silver Sparkle finish with an SKB hard case. These are MIM and are very good quality. I've read that there were around 180 guitars made in this Silver Sparkle finish so they are pretty rare. I have changed out the original Seymour Duncan pickups with an EMG 81/85 Zakk Wylde Active pickup set. Otherwise this guitar is all original. I no longer have the Duncans. Built for center stage, the spotlight and your favorite solo, Charvel's limited-run Super Stock So-Cal Silver Sparkle is a dazzling high-performance instrument. Its sleek So-Cal body is clad in a scintillating silver-sparkle finish that looks stunning beneath the stage lights, elegantly complemented by a matching headstock and black pickguard. Other premium features include a quartersawn maple neck with an oil finish and comfortable Pro Mod profile, fast and smooth compound-radius rosewood fingerboard (12\"-16\") with 22 jumbo frets, Seymour Duncan\u00ae '59 (neck) and JB\u2122 (bridge) humbucking pickups, three-position chrome-tip toggle pickup switch and single knurled control knob (master volume), Floyd Rose\u00ae Original tremolo bridge and locking nut, and non-locking Charvel tuners.

The guitar is very clean overall, hard to find any marks on it as it's been played very little. There are NO dings, dents or scratches. There may be a few minute marks here and there if you look really hard. The guitar currently has Schaller strap buttons on it but I'll be putting the original ones back on it. Currently the EMG 85 is in the bridge position and the 81 is in the neck as that's the set up that I like. But these have the quick connect wires so you can easily swap them out if you prefer. This Silver Sparkle finish is awesome and the photos don't do it justice. The SKB case is in very good condition but does have a few marks as you see in the photos. One of the inside straps has torn away but but the back one is nicely in tact and all the latches are nice and tight so it has no issues. Condition is very subjective but I describe everything as best I can and I do have a 100% positive seller rating. If you have any questions please ask.
