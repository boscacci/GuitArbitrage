{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Custom built 2011 Suhr Classic. Absolutely beautiful condition. Hardly played. I am the original owner. It has spent most of its life in its case, which is a darn shame, but I just never got around to all the recording I had planned to do with it (I'm sure many of you musicians know how those \"big plans\" go). It's just too good (and expensive) an instrument to sit in a case, so I'm finally letting it go. See the attached photo of the original order/spec sheet for all of the specs. This is essentially a super strat. Alder body, maple neck, Indian rosewood fretboard with compound radius, versatile HSS pickup configuration with 5-way switch (the Suhr pickups are unmatched in their clarity and power), volume and tone controls, smooth/accurate two-point trem, Spertzel locking tuners, and BEAUTIFUL candy apple red finish with black pick guard and matching headstock. Original hard shell case. This instrument sounds and plays as beautiful as it looks. Sorry about the reflections in the photos. FYI, the first photo is the photo that Suhr sent to me right after they built it. See my 100 percent positive feedback rating and bid with confidence. If you have any questions about the instrument, feel free to message me. I will double box for safe shipping by UPS or Fedex.
