{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I know I\u2019m probably gonna regret selling this axe, but as a former guitar amp builder, I\u2019ve acquired more guitars and gear over the years than I can count, so it\u2019s time to thin the herd. This guitar is a Customized right-handed Limited Edition Fender USA American Deluxe Stratosonic. These are rare guitars, as Fender only made them for a few years after introducing them at the Winter NAMM show in 2003. The serial number shows that this axe was made in 2003 - 2004 at Fender\u2019s plant in Corona, California. She sports a chambered mahogany Strat body with 5 tone chambers, traditional Strat front and back contours, wrap-around tailpiece, gorgeous crimson red/cherry finish and original Fender hardshell case. She\u2019s in exceptional condition, almost totally mint. This axe is a true Closet Queen. I\u2019ve only played her a handful of times over the years, never gigged her or taken her out of the house. She\u2019s been quietly sitting in my closet in her original Fender case for many years and needs to find a player that can appreciate her beauty, comfort, tone and versatility. Cosmetically, I went over this axe from top to bottom and examined every square inch. She has no visible dings, scratches or buckle rash on the body. You\u2019re only gonna find normal extremely light surface swirls on the body that are difficult to see unless you\u2019re holding the guitar at an angle in direct light. These are the light surface swirls that you typically get from a polishing cloth or light contact with clothing. The pickguard has the same extremely light swirls and one barely perceptible \u201cding/scratch\u201d? That one on the pick guard is so small and insignificant, I don\u2019t even know what to call it. It\u2019s smaller than a flea but since it\u2019s a little bit more than just a typical light swirl, I\u2019m reporting it. A couple of insignificant \u201cblips\u201d about the size of the head of a pin on back near the controls cover, and on the front around the tone knob. I don\u2019t even know what to call these, looks like they were a result of Fender\u2019s finishing process. I tried to photograph them but they\u2019re so small they won\u2019t show up. I never noticed them before and you wouldn\u2019t know they were there unless you knew they were there, and held the guitar at the right angle in direct light. Really insignificant but since I did notice them during an intense inspection, I\u2019m reporting them. The Neck is in perfect condition with a smooth satin finish and plays effortlessly. No scratches, dings, nada. Same with the black headstock. Fretboard is perfect, no dings or scratches and frets show no visible signs of wear. This Closet Queen just might be the cleanest example of a pre-owned Stratosonic that you\u2019ll ever find. Overall, I\u2019d give the condition of this axe an easy 9+/10. The only way this guitar could be in better shape is if it came brand new direct from the factory. What\u2019s really unique about this axe is that although it\u2019s a Strat design, it has the shorter Gibson 24 \u00be\u201d scale, along with a Chambered Honduran Mahogany Body, and wraparound tailpiece. By the way, this axe has been customized. The previous owner replaced the so-so stock P90\u2019s with DiMarzio Humbucking Soapbars (sorry, I don\u2019t remember which models) and push-pull volume and tone pots with chrome knurled knobs. Need an axe with versatility? Here ya go. With the push-pull pots, both Humbuckers can be split into single coils, offering a mixture & variety of single and/or humbucking tones giving the player the best of both worlds. You can now go from sweet jangly single coil tones to raunchy humbucking tones with the push-pull volume & tone knobs. Since you\u2019ll have a choice of using the DiMarzio\u2019s in Humbucking or Single Coil mode, and/or mixing between the two, you\u2019ll get a total of 8 different tones instead of just the 3 you\u2019d get with the stock P-90\u2019s. If you\u2019re running through a high gain amp or using distortion pedals and don\u2019t want single coil hum, then just pop those pup\u2019s into humbucking mode and enjoy the silence. Wanna play Hard Rock? Blues? Country? Jazz? No problem. From clean spank to hard grind to singing sustain, this axe gives up the goods.
