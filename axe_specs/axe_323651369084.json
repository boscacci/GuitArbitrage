{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "https://www.tutti.ch/de/vi/zuerich/musik/instrumente/e-gitarre-westone-thunder-ii-a-1983/24883276I have Thunder II that has a traditional set neck, and believe the neck motif is a feature that distinguishes the Thunder I (bolt-on), II (set), and III (neck-thru). This web site shows a neck-thru motif on a purported Thunder IIA similar this listed guitar, but I believe it is a mislabeled Thunder III version 3. I have a Thunder 11A and it looks nothing like this guitar. Condition-wise, it is in good but not perfect shape. The main issue is a shallow crack at the neck/headstock volute consistent with an impact at some point, sort of a \u201csplinter crack\u201d (see photo). The impact dislodged some of the finish, and the crack was sealed with epoxy and is completely solid. There is no evidence of any more damage since I\u2019m confident this is the original finish (no evidence of other finishes in the control cavity). The frets have wear, but have life left in them. There are a bumps and scratches typical of a nearly 40-year old used instrument. It plays great with very low action! Unplugged, the guitar has a nice ringing tone and exceptional sustain, but when it\u2019s amplified it is one of the better rock-n-roll instruments I ever played, with an amazing variety of tonal options. All the electronic signals are strong, but a bit \u201cscratchy\u201d; cleaning and contact treatment should clear this up. The guitar comes with a functional 1980s Fender hard clamshell case in good but funky (painted; see photos) condition.
