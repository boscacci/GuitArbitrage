{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is an early (long discontinued) Dean FBD Tribute ML. These came out shortly after Dime's death. This one is in near perfect cosmetic and playing condition. There are no chips in the finish, and even the sticker is in perfect condition. There are some very slight surface scratches on the back of the guitar and one of the black bolts on the Floyd is rusted. But, even a spare bolt without any rust is included (I didn't want to mess with detuning and retuning the guitar). Over the course of the guitar's history, the original Gotoh-style press in temolo arm was replaced (Dean sent me a screw-down replacement when I asked for one, and I can't find the original to include it), one of the saddles stripped (Dean sent me a replacement saddle that is currently installed; the stripped saddle is included along with the string clamp bolt mentioned earlier), the original electrical tape over the edges of the neck pickup was replaced, and the neck pickup that Dean installed was replaced with a Seymour Duncan '59. Dime's signature pickup set is the Dimebucker (which this guitar came with) in the bridge and a '59 in the neck, so I don't know why Dean didn't put a '59 in the neck on this guitar. The '59 sounds better than the pickup Dean installed, but I have included the Dean pickup with the guitar. I searched and I could not find the original truss rod cover. It should have \"ML\" printed on it, and comparing photos online, seems to be the same one that Dean still puts on their current ML guitars. The hardshell case is included, but does have some scuffs and small tears. I also stupidly used duct tape to label the case and put my contact info on the case, which leaves behind a residue. I will do my best to remove it. So, what you're getting is a guitar that has been well cared for and performs and sounds better than it did from the factory. This guitar was used by me on several recordings, and was the first of many Deans I purchased. I am selling this guitar because I prefer guitars with larger frets (this guitar feels like it has medium-jumbo frets) and am making room/paying for new purchases. It's time for someone to enjoy it as much as I did.", "ItemID": "192699628482", "EndTime": "2018-10-31T06:08:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-24T06:08:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dean-Dimebag-Far-Beyond-Driven-FBD-Tribute-ML-Electric-Guitar-/192699628482", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Jarrettsville, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1926996284828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/U~kAAOSwVXRbxl30/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WYAAAOSwhZ5bxl3u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kwQAAOSwup1bxl3x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xlIAAOSwFIRbxl3q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nSQAAOSw9~5bxl33/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kvUAAOSwup1bxl3o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/b7cAAOSwvK1bxl3w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/-kYAAOSwvKhbxl35/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/en4AAOSwIDJbxl3t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/EN8AAOSwYsBbxl37/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/2lAAAOSw2jNbxl3-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oBsAAOSwDDRbxl31/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "21084", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rockguitar86", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 215, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 122}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Dean Dimebag Far Beyond Driven FBD Tribute ML Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Dean"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["DBDRIVEN"]}]}, "HitCount": 144, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "219503252", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
