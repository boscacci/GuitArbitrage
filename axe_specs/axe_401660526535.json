Already in 1999 the pickups, custom DiMarzio \"GEN1\", were changed to the GEN2 version (also by DiMarzio). In the mid nineties, GEN1 pickups were criticized for having a much too \"hi-fi tone\". Lately the GEN1 pickups have gained more attention and are now categorized the real deal for a Fly by many people. In 2003 some more aspects of this guitar were changed: The layout was reduced from four knobs to three, as well as the entire electronics were exchanged for a cheaper version that was used on the Nightfly exclusively until then. Also parts of the hardware have been replaced for cheaper ones, making the production more cost effective. Differences between the pre refined and refined Parker Fly are explained. Parker Fly electronics - some technical details: The Parker Fly is has quite complex electronics installed. The heart of the pre refined electronics is the Fishman Board (it reads \u201eFly 1 REV 1 FISHMAN\u201c). All connections to pots and switches are done by ribbon cables). Swerving from the use of conventional wiring was another important aspect for Ken Parker in creating a very modern instrument. The ribbon cables work very fine but have one disadvantage: They are quite fragile, torn very easily and almost impossible to replace, as there aren\u2018t any spare parts available. If your Fly has this issue you can either convert the wiring to a or ask members of the who have done this conversion if they would sell you their (intact) ribbon cables. My and I didn\u2018t want to change its original state. The problem has been caused by the battery clip cable that was wound around the ribbon cable. I would have never identified this as a trouble maker. But every time I changed the battery, I tore a little of the ribbon tape py pulling the battery cable. And at some point the switch for the piezo pickups didn\u2018t do its job anymore. I tried to repair the tape: Soldering didn\u2018t seem to be an option for me as the ribbon is so fragile. Also I didn\u2018t manage to short cut the broken parts with conductive silver coating (the conductive paths are so near to each other, so the the coating always touched the next path no matter how careful I covered it with tape). In the end it took me more than two years to find someone willing to sell me an unharmed set of ribbon cables that I installed. Of course I led the battery cable that was wound around the ribbon cable in the Parker factory the direct way this time. So there won\u2018t be any ribbon cable problems in future anymore!", "ItemID": "401660526535", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T16:49:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-17T16:49:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Parker-Fly-Natural-Mahogany-Pre-Refined-Hard-Shell-Case-/401660526535", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover", "AmEx"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/4016605265358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/p~wAAOSwPuRcF8-L/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/XnoAAOSwHOZcF8-Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/c~oAAOSwvERcF8-Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/dBAAAOSwPVFcF8-f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/-uAAAOSwrQxcF9Ax/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/egwAAOSwk4RcF8-y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/RBgAAOSw8MxcF8-6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/J70AAOSwcVpcF8~A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "46236", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "audiodude", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2682, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Parker Fly Natural Mahogany Pre-Refined with Hard Shell Case", "HitCount": 327, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
