{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "up for bid we have a prs se eg model .. made in 2004 .. very very limited edition and to be honest i'm not sure why .. this was made way before the john mayer model was even a gleam in prs's eye if you get my drift .. and i'm not sure why he stopped makin em .. great guitars .. the best strat you'll ever play thats not a strat .. but this is different than a strat and the newer john mayers in a few ways .. this is a 10 radius neck and its a set neck like all the other se models are .. the john mayer is a bolt on and its a 7.25 radius which is more like a 62 strat .. will prs come out with a se version of the john mayer ?? ehh .. maybe .. but if he does because it will be so different and he'll have to tool up special for these i'd bet dollars to donuts that it'll be the highest price se when all is said and done .. but i'm sure it'll be a good guitar .. prs don't do anything halfway ..and the se's are the most bang for your buck guitars out there .. this has a good sized full sized block and i put in 4 springs but you could get by with 3 or even 5 if you want an even stiffer or looser feel .. i put it on my digital scale and it comes in at 7 pounds and 6 ounces so its a tad lighter than a regular strat .. another thing you'd notice if you put a fender next to a prs you'll see the fender is a bit bigger .. yet it don't look that way when someone is playin one .. just one of them hmm... kinda things so that could account for the half pound less .. this guitar is in fantastic condition .. pretty much like new .. i can't find any flaws on it so its been well taken care of .. and its still pretty much a metal flake lake placid blue .. if it had been left out in the light more it would go more towards an ocean turquoise as it yellows with age .. so far tho far as i can see this hasn't moved at all .. and it probably won't for a long time .. this comes with a prs gigbag and they are the best gigbags you can get .. nothin better .. so time to talk turkey .. this will start at 599 and ship for 50 dollars to the lower 48 ins. included .. these are hard to come by and gettin harder every day ..so if you want a strat but somethin just a little different and as some have said maybe even a little better ?? this is in your wheelhouse .. you snooze you lose .. any questions please ask and i'll get back asap .. thanks for lookin ..", "ItemID": "123571470929", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T21:15:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T21:15:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-SE-EG-STRAT-STYLE-RARE-MODEL-MADE-BEFORE-JOHN-MAYER-LOOK-AND-SEE-/123571470929", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "North Fort Myers, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235714709298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DDUAAOSwHupblcMJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mzk=/z/118AAOSwZ~tblcMU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FUAAAOSwkJNblcMf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qnYAAOSwXOBblcMw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b5sAAOSwZgxblcND/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ki4AAOSw6W9blcNQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8S4AAOSw07lblcNe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MDI=/z/3N0AAOSwFSRblcNo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NzI=/z/-k0AAOSwq~JblcN0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3dAAAOSwCf9blcln/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33917", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "junkyard-guitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 981, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 37}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS SE EG STRAT STYLE RARE MODEL MADE BEFORE THE JOHN MAYER LOOK AND SEE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SE EG"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 80, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 609.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "EXCELLENT CONDITION", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
