{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "56 year-old USA-Made Strat with awesome and Rare Birdseye neck, clay dots, refin in Teal, big frets! This is a PLAYER instrument, not a collector one. That's why it's not $20K, though it totally sounds and plays like $20K! I've owned dozens of vintage Strats over the years, from all-original to highly modded, and this one SOUNDS as good as any of them (which is why I've kept it all these years!), and the primary reason is the incredibly resonant and very old WOOD. In addition, it has really excellent parts. Kinman noiseless pickups are among the best no-hum single coil type you can buy, and they sound great, and though not exactly the same as a single coil, they are as close as you can get. (My other fav no-hums are made by Bill Lawrence). It has a steel block bridge that adds tone and sustain like the vintage ones. It has a bypass filter on the volume control so you don't lose highs when you turn down. The frets are big, round and very level for excellent action. BTW the tuners are Dimarzio Low Mass exact replacements for vintage strat tuners, no extra holes! I really like them but if you prefer the more vintage style Kluson type I am happy to swap them at no charge. (that way I get to keep the Dimarzios which are hard to find). This is a more than amazing sounding Fender Stratocaster, resonant and really magical sounding and playing, with a veneer maple fingerboard like the ones Jimi played, only better! It's light at 8 pounds, with a super dry and resonant alder body (many later Fenders with alder weigh well over 10 pounds and sound quite dead!), a real plus for both sound and comfort. This guitar has dings and such, but nothing bad, and it looks great, I think. It is rock solid stable, and stays in tune as well as any Strat I've ever owned or played. I am more than happy to let you play this and my other guitars if you are or can come to San Diego, and local pickup is free of shipping costs. So what\u2019s a veneer maple fingerboard and why should you care?Well, almost all Fender maple necks are 1-piece with no glued-on fingerboard,unlike rosewood necks, which have a fingerboard glued on top, though most of those are SLAB boards, not veneer. A slab has a flat surface where it is glued to the flat-topped maple neck. The slab of rosewood is then rounded (radiused) at the top (where the frets go), creating the familiar curved radius (usually rounder on Fenders and less round on Gibsons). In a veneer neck the top of the maple neck is itself rounded, and a wood veneer (with a constant thickness) is heated and bent over the maple. Leo Fender at first made all maple 1-piece necks, then in late 1959 started to use the slab fingerboards (like Gibson used and still uses) because he didn\u2019t like the way maple discolored with use. After a few years he began using the rosewood veneers instead, but did not use maple veneers at all while he owned the company. As the first G&L dealer in San Diego I got to meet Leo and I asked him about that. He said it was because veneers made the neck stiffer and more resistant to warping, and it turns out that it also creates more bass volume. As for sound and playability, this is not a good or bad thing overall, just a matter of personal preference, though they are more difficult to manufacture. The neck is very straight and 1 11/16\u201d wide at the nut, on the low end of medium size there, fattening up as you go up the neck. The body vibrates strongly right into your chest when you play it acoustically in a way that only great guitars do. I won\u2019t even plug in a guitar unless it does that, because the electronics can only amplify what\u2019s there, and if the guitar is dead sounding acoustically then you will also have a dead sounding, but loud, amplified guitar. The bridge it set up so it floats a bit (the way Leo designed it to do), but if you prefer I\u2019ll be happy to adjust it so it lays down flat down against the wood, which makes tuning more stable, especially if you break a string. But floating adds more of the sound of the springs resonance, and allows you to use the trem to bend both up and down, and tremolo a whole chord in a rather beautiful way. The trem arm has almost no play, which I really like. So why am I selling? I\u2019m getting old (just over 72 now) and a bit deaf, plus pretty terrible tinnitus (constant ringing in my ears), and I have way too much stuff (just ask my wife!) So I must tearfully say goodbye to nearly all of it. Sigh. And I\u2019d prefer that I don\u2019t burden my kids with having to get rid of it after I die. I have been selling on eBay since 1997. My eBay user names are edch, and sdhark858, both with tons of great feedback, which you can easily check. In a previous life I founded Guitar Trader in San Diego, and then sold it about 30 years ago. I\u2019ve owned just about every rare guitar (including real vintage 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s Les Pauls, Strats, Teles, 335s, etc etc), as well as just about every old amp and pedal there is. So when I tell you something is exceptional (and really I\u2019ve only kept the truly exceptional gear) I do have the experience to know. Does that mean you will love what I love? Probably, but it ain\u2019t necessarily so. First off, everyone has their own preferences. Then there is how things are setup. Do you prefer high action or low? Fat strings or skinny? The type of pickups, hardware, wiring, caps, tubes, etc ALL make a difference. Also, some things work better together, some don\u2019t, so most people find that a Tube Screamer sounds better with a Fender amp than a Marshall, whereas a Fuzz Face likes Marshalls better. So with a different amp or guitar you might prefer something different, plus your ears are different too, so don\u2019t let anyone tell you what you should like; doesn\u2019t work with food, art, music, or anything else, really. So if you play through a Marshall, a Vox or a Fender you might prefer different guitars, effects, and so on for each amp. Jimi used an old coil cord which killed the treble with high capacitance, then used a treble booster! Doesn\u2019t matter, it WORKED! I never argue with what works :<) Fun link about simulating old coil cords:premierguitar.com/articles/The_Vintage_Coiled_Cable_Simulator_Mod Willing to ship internationally if I can do so safely. I am happy to include a good, non-vintage Fender hard shell case for just the extra shipping cost, which could be anywhere from $25 to well over $100 depending on where it's going.
