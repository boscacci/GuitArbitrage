{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Imagine being able to travel back in time to 1990, visiting your favorite Ibanez guitar dealer and picking this off the wall? Well, here is that dream come true. A practically new 1990 Ibanez RG550 in gorgeous LASER BLUE metallic. The one and only ORIGINAL Real Deal, equipped with the one-piece original Wizard neck...and apparently never to be built again with these specs.Truly a Case Queen / Closet Classic if there ever was such a thing. From the Golden Era of Ibanez RG's. These masterpieces were built by some of the finest luthiers in modern history at the now legendary Fuji-Gen Gakki factory in Japan.For the exceptionally anal out there...yes. If you stick your nose close enough to this guitar you may find 'marks' here or there. It is, after all, 29 years old. But rest assured you will really have to look for them. American-designed V1-S1-V2 pickups. Widely regarded as some of the FINEST pickups that Ibanez has ever graced the RG550 with. NO fret wear or fret board wear. NO neck pocket cracks or cracks behind the locking nut. All relevant hardware is stunningly like new. NO noise when switching between every pickup configuration. Plays and sounds like all vintage original RG550's...MASSIVE and SWEET. Comes with the trem bar and original Ibanez hardshell case in excellent condition as shown.Laser Blue is one of those Ibanez finish colors that's nearly impossible to accurately photograph. The head stock photo is the best representation, and the color is even brighter in daylight lighting. And there's definitely a sheen of teal green to it, making it want to photograph a darker blue at times. Very unique.If you know anything about this company, this is definitely one of the years you want to own. And unlike some of the other RG550 colors, Laser Blue has never been reissued.(Here's what another seller as to say about these originals.) \"There is a reason that this exact guitar can still be purchased today as a reissue, and that is because it is truly an amazing instrument. However, if you are like me, there is no substitute for the original and I wouldn\u2019t bother wasting your money on a reissued genesis. The majority of the specs are the same, however, the original wizard neck profile is considered by many as the best neck that Ibanez ever made vs the super wizard.\" This is being listed on several different venues, so don't procrastinate. An opportunity like this doesn't come around very often, if ever. Guitar will be professionally packed and fully insured of course. Read my feedback and buy with confidence.
