{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is a yamaha pacifica 302s tele style guitar. Nice blueburst color thats pretty hard to come across. I feel it might be a lil bit faded (at least to me - it does look like the pics tho) Frets have a lot of life left in them. Has normal wear & tear with a few minor dings/dents/scratches to be expected with a guitar this age (think it was made in the mid 90s) however theres a pretty nice ding in the front which goes down to wood, as you can see in the pics. THeres also a screw hole in the back - guessing someone wanted to move the strap button once upon a time. All in a all a really solid great playing guitar. Letting it go b/c I just have too many guitar & this doesnt get played as much as it should. *This is going to be shipped with the neck unbolted from the body, unless I come across a guitar sized box. Feel free to ask any questions.
