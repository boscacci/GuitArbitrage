{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for an Edwards Limited Model LP-style guitar, in very good used condition, made in Japan. I don't know the model number and can't be sure of the year of manufacture, but based on the year I bought it and its condition, I estimate that it was made around 2010. I can't find a serial number on it, so I can't verify that. I believe it was made in Japan because I bought it on ebay from a seller in Japan, and he said it was Japanese-made. Edwards is a well-known brand name that has been producing a variety of electric guitar models since the 1980's. I don't think you'll be disappointed with the build quality of this guitar. My bathroom scale indicates a weight of 8.6 lbs. All the electronics work. One of the pick-ups is labeled Seymour Duncan, tho' I don't know the model name, nor do I know their output. The action and set-up seem fine; no buzzing, good intonation, and easy to play. Of course, that's subjective. You'll probably want to change the strings (I think these are 10s) and I'd put some fret oil on the board first if I were changing the strings, too. The fret board looks like rosewood, and the fret ends are smooth, not rough or sharp as sometimes happens with cheaper guitars. Some of the frets show some wear, especially near the lower frets, but they're in good overall condition. There are a few small dings and nicks, as you can see in the photos. There are two small indentations on the front, two on the back, one on the back of the neck, and two on the edges, one of which is on the lower bout. There are also 3 small nicks on the front of the head stock, too small to photograph clearly and a couple of other small indentations below the bridge. They are not major, but I mention them in the interest of full disclosure. It comes with a Fender Deluxe gig bag in good condition. Shipping is a flat $90 in the US, which will include insurance. I cannot ship overseas. Local pick-up is possible; in fact, I prefer it. If you have any questions or would like any other photographs, let me know and I will try to provide a response ASAP.", "ItemID": "153247198522", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T05:32:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-05T05:32:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Edwards-Limited-Model-LP-style-made-in-Japan-used-very-good-condition-/153247198522", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Long Beach, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532471985228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/N70AAOSw2YZbzQTw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SIQAAOSwAjpbzQVe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Pn0AAOSwcbRbzQU-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jgcAAOSw71pbzQUv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5IIAAOSwTghbzQWd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dMQAAOSwqCJbzQXV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hS0AAOSwhgtbzQXq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-u4AAOSwdrhbzQYJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ExEAAOSwa6ZbzQYn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3P4AAOSwGI9bzQZ8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~yQAAOSwa3ZbzVRN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZqoAAOSwtxlbzVTX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90815", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cryingsky", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 386, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 224}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Edwards Limited Model LP-style made-in-Japan, used, in very good condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Edwards"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["LP solid mahogany body"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["probably mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["2 volume, 2 tone knobs"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["carved top"]}, {"Name": "Applicable Regions", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Edwards Limited Model"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Yellow / Orange flame, red sides and back"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["Around 2010"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 60, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "In very good used condition.
