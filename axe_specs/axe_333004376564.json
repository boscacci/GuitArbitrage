{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This 350v63 is a 1999 vintage reissue of the 1963 Rickenbacker Model 450 in rare Burgundy-Glo. It features the \u201ccresting wave\u201d body design and two RIC toaster pickups. It is in excellent near mint condition, except for a very, very small surface finish scrape behind the 9th fret. It is virtually imperceptible to the feel when playing, and was there when I purchased it used from Pick of the Ricks around 2000-2001. I tried getting it to show in one of the photos. It does not deter from either the guitar\u2019s appearance or it\u2019s playability. A vintage reissue silver Rickenbacker case with blue crushed velvet interior is included\u2026 the case is in excellent condition. The guitar currently has D\u2019Addario light strings on it and was in tune when I removed it from the case for pictures. Typical used models sell for VERY much more than my opening bid, and much more than my Buy It Now price. In the last year or so, I sold a matching 360 and an old slant fret. Watch my auctions for more RIC beauties that I\u2019ll be listing. Thanks for looking. I will only sell to buyers in the contiguous 48 states. No international sales. Insured shipping is $55.00. This guitar is a beauty and is accurately described, so returns will not be accepted. Please don\u2019t bid unless you want it.", "ItemID": "333004376564", "EndTime": "2019-01-15T23:35:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-08T23:35:54.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1999-Rickenbacker-450v63-6-String-Burgundy-Glo-/333004376564", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Rayland, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330043765648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aj0AAOSwvcFcNS-a/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oVAAAOSwwDJcNS-c/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FdIAAOSw87JcNS-e/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/td8AAOSw~TNcNS-j/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/StoAAOSwpwBcNS-h/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TjYAAOSwJQVcNS-g/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4f8AAOSwr~9cNS-l/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/THoAAOSwC~9cNTBe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cUsAAOSwx9lcNTBg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EmgAAOSw4sNcNTBj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kkIAAOSwKL5cNTBl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6ZEAAOSwF7lcNTBn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "43943", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lennonj", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 297, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1893.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1893.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 823}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1999 Rickenbacker 450v63  6-String Burgundy-Glo", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Rickenbacker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Burgundy-Glo"]}]}, "HitCount": 139, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1918.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
