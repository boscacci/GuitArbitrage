In 1958 Epiphone produced its first guitars in the Gibson Kalamazoo factory. It was a momentous time for both companies and especially for Epiphone fans and dealers who only a few years before had feared the company might not survive the decade. The Sheraton not only loudly declared that Epiphone was back in business, but it also heralded a new era in guitar design that put the Kalamazoo factor way out in front in giving musicians exciting new instruments. For decades, Epiphone and Gibson had been bitter rivals in archtop design. After the two companies merged, engineer\u2019s from both companies combined decades of expertise and trade secrets to create the Electric Spanish (ES) collection which included the legendary ES-335 semi-hollowbody.
