{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Excellent condition 2016 limited run model. This guitar has the lightly aged \"VOS\" treatment to the finish, plastics, and metal hardware so it does not look like a shiny new instrument, this is how this model was built, the swirl marks/faint surface scratches are characteristics of this treatment. There is little to no actual wear from playing on this guitar, it was very lightly played in a smoke-free home studio setting, still has the scent of a new Gibson! Includes original hardshell case (black with yellow interior, no Gibson logo) and certificate of authenticity.\u00a0 Fun fact, this was the same model that Bradley Cooper played in \"A Star is Born\"! Guitar will be well packed and ready to ship as soon asap once payment is received.\u00a0 No shipping outside of the continental USA, please don't bid or request me to ship if you are outside of this region. Spec details for this model from the manufacturer;\u00a0 The 1964 ES-345 Olive Drab Green VOS is a historically accurate re-creation of this much loved semi. It comes in an exotic alternative vintage finish that never made it to the originals of the '60s. That's complemented by split parallelogram fingerboard inlays and period-correct plastics, hot hide glue neck and body construction, matched potentiometer sets, rolled fingerboard binding and a great set of MHS humbuckers for true PAF tone.
