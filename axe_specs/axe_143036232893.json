{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello eBay Friends! For sale today we a 1989 Kramer Sustainer 1989 Kramer Sustainer Guitar w/ Floyd Rose Sustainer Hard Case Original Paperwork PLUS FREE SHIPPING AND 30 Men's Large Rock 'N Roll T-Shirts In Great Condition (more details on this below) I was the only owner and the Kramer Sustainer in great working condition ready for the stage or studio. Serial number on the guitar is F 9344 and built on September 28th, 1989 (see pictures for the paper work verification). PLEASE NOTE: 3 IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS GUITAR \u2014 FULL DISCLOSURE: #1: When you attach the Two Batteries in the back of the guitar the 9 Volt connection clips are a little bit loose and the connection clips will need to be replaced, when you put the two batteries in you will see that depending on the angle of insertion the 9 volts connect but the Green light on the outside of the guitar comes on or off, this is do to these 9 Volt Clips needing to be replaced, any guitar tech could do this. Also please read the Floyd Rose Sustainer manual that will come with the guitar so that you understand the function, their are 3 mini switches on the guitar. Switch One \"Right Position\" is when the Sustainer works and Switch Two \"Up Position\" (Fundamental Mode) is the desired position for 95% of your playing, the other two positions (Down and Middle) are the Harmonic Mode and Harmonic with Increased Sensitivity. These are relative to where you play and based on Harmonic Function, they work but it seems to me Fundamental Mode has always worked the best, this is the nature of this Floyd Rose Sustainer design. #2: This guitar is set up in Eb (half step down) with brand new Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky Stings in the gauge of (009, 011, 016, 026, 036, 046) IF you want to take this guitar to Standard tuning you will have to use Ernie Ball Regular Slinky Strings (or any size that you want) but please know that you have to get the bridge re-set up for what ever new gauge and tuning that you want. Any pro guitar repair guy can do this in about 10 minutes or less so no big deal. #3: The Volume potentiometer has a broken post so you or your repair guy will have to place a new potentiometer, again no big deal and about 10 minutes of work to get it done. Volume potentiometer does work but the knob is just a bit loose and you will see that when you get the guitar. The guitar does not ship with batteries for safety's sake so Two New 9 Volt batteries are required to operate the Sustainer, please get batteries when you get the guitar. This guitar comes from my personal collection so take care of it well, it will bring you magic songs :-) For the the T-Shirts they are all in the size of Men's Large are clean with no ripsor tears and have very gentle wear to them. Buy with confidence, I have a 100% PERFECT eBay selling score! Cheers. Byron Nemeth Here are the list of shirts: 1. KISS \"Alive 1975\"2. Aerosmith \"Toys In The Attic\"3. Michael Schenker \"76\" 4.
