{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 1994 Rickenbacker 650D Dakota. The guitar is in good condition for its age. I bought it from a collector, but decided that it\u2019s not for me. The pics show a few dings and scratches from use over the years. Electronics are good, but pots can be a little noisy while turning them, nothing some contact cleaner couldn\u2019t solve. Looks like the neck may have been re-fretted at some point as well. The action is decent. The guitar comes with the case pictured. Also in great shape. Truss rod wrench is in the case as well. Serial number I7 7917. Please note, this is a 24 years old guitar that has been played. I\u2019m just pointing out that it is not brand new...it is used. This seems to be a difficult concept for some. Please don\u2019t bid if you\u2019re looking for a showroom condition guitar, this one has been well used.
