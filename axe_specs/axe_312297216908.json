From 2006, one owner. Great wood pattern. Minor belt scratches on back. Had a cracked headstock but was professionally repaired in 2008. I used it for years after that with no issues. Records great, plays great live. Holds a tune extremely well. Intonation may need some configuring since it's been in it's case for over a year without touching it and it will need a new strap lock at the neck.Stock Gibson Humbuckers. Stock Case. The case is a little beat up on the outside, but the inside is very clean and in good shape. The lock I had removed because the code had changed on me one time before a set and I couldn't get my guitar out. I have placed it in the storage part of the case if you wish to reattach it. The case also needs a new handle (or some duct tape). Capo and Strap included. All in all this is a very well made guitar with minor bumps and scratches from 12 years of use.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
