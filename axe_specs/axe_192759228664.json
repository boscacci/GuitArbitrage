{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "PLEASE IGNORE THE PRODUCT DETAILS ABOVE. THIS WAS SOMEHOW INSERTED BY EBAY AND IS SOMEWHAT INCORRECT. THIS IS NOT A MEMPHIS MADE GUITAR. THIS GUITAR WAS MADE IN NASHVILLE IN 1996. This has been a good guitar but it's time to let somebody else have some fun with it. Here's eccentricities: It has a broken and professionally repaired headstock break. This was over 10 years ago and I haven't had any issues with it since. I took the pick guard off a long time ago and now I can't find it so I have to sell it without the pick guard.There is a Fralin humbucker in the neck position and the original '57 Classic in the bridge position. Otherwise this is a great playing and sounding guitar. Frets seems to be in great shape and the setup is low and smooth for jazz. No buzzing or fretting out. D'Addario flat wounds .012-.052 are on it now. Comes with original hardshell case. Shipping to lower 48 of U.S. only.
