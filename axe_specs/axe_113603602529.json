{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "With Hardshell Case, Ebony/Bone Bridge, and USA Wiring upgrade all performed by Phred Instruments in their CA shop. This is a gorgeous guitar. I ordered it new from Phred Instruments in March 2018 and received it in October 2018. I really like it, but decided that I have too many guitars and in the few months I've had this, I've only played it a few times. Since we're making room for more kids, I need to clear out some music gear. That's the only reason I'm selling it. This guitar would retail for about $1,075 with the options it has: Guitar, Hardshell Case, Ebony/Bone Bridge, USA wiring, but you could get it for less AND you won't have to wait 7 months to get it, like I did. Even brand new, this guitar is a tremendous value. Phred is getting quite popular, and for good reason. Hopefully, I'll get another one in the future. NOTE: On the case, there's a small puncture (less than 1/8\") a few inches away from the case's handle. I have no idea how it got there. I suspect it was always there and I didn't notice until taking the pictures for this listing. See picture. The guitar itself is spotless, however.
