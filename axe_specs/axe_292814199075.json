{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Please be sure to read all listing details: This listing is for a used Epiphone Cherry Sunburst Les Paul Guitar. Plays amazing with nice low action & sounds great. Has a dragon sticker on the front of it - looks cool I think. Has two dents / dings on the back and some smaller dings / scratches on the top from typical use. Overall a clean guitar with very little playing wear on the frets. It might be a Plus Top as it has a really nice flame maple wood grain on the top. Please be sure to review all photos. If you have any questions, please let us know.
