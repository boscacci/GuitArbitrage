And I always feel so. Vintage Greco and vintage Aria proII and vintage Epiphone japan are very similar. Vintage Tokai and vintage Burny are very similar. However, I feel Yamaha is not similar to any brand. YAMAHA is characteristic. And I always think about the all old YAMAHA. I think the quality of wood is high anyway. It can consistently say to the old YAMAHA. That can be said for low price SL-380 too. High quality wood is used for this LP-400BL. I think that you can understand immediately. Making is polite anyway. Current, Some High end model guitars are made in Japan, but others are produced in Yamaha's own factory in China. It may be the cause, but currently in Japan, Yamaha's electric guitar is not popular. This is a Yamaha guitar of a very popular era. Produced by Kasuga musical instrument manufacture. Kasuga musical instrument manufacture was producing acoustic guitar, banjo, violin. Representative brands are \"Heerby\" \"ELECTRA\" \"Gaban\" \"Ganson\" \"RK Herby\" \"The KASUGA\" etc. Currently, it is all evaluated as Japan Vintage. This LP400BL has dignity of vintage guitar.
