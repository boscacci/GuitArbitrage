{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Our eBay Store About Us Fender Classic Player Baja Telecaster Electric Guitar (Blonde) Designed by Fender Custom Shop Master Builder Chris Fleming, the Classic Player Baja Telecaster blends vintage-inspired Tele features with a variety of mods that set it apart from the rest including a set of Custom Shop-designed pickups, special tone circuitry and switching, and more!The body is made from ash and comes dressed in your choice of Blonde, 2-Color Sunburst or Black gloss finishes. The perfect mixture of classic 50s feel and modern playability, the maple neck has been shaped into a cozy, somewhat rounded soft \"V\" profile instead of the more pronounced, sharper 50s-style \"V\" shape. The maple board also features a contemporary 9.5\" radius and houses 21 medium-jumbo frets.Helping to put this Tele in a class all its own, the Fender Classic Player Baja Telecaster comes equipped with premium pickups and incredibly versatile electronics. First, a rare feature for a Fender at this price point, this Tele comes fitted with a pair of top-of-the-line Custom Shop single-coil pickups: a vintage-style Tele bridge pickup and a \"Twisted\" Tele neck pickup. These pickups dish out all that timeless Tele twang and tone that made the originals legendary. Whats more? The pickups are wired through a unique 4-position pickup selector switch as opposed to the typical 3-position switch, which allows you to combine the neck and bridge pickups in series for fatter tone and higher output--perfect for delivering raw, hard-rocking tone. Giving you even more sonic flexibility, the volume control features two-way S-1 switching that changes the pickup wiring from in-phase to out-of-phase when both pickups are on.The Classic Player Baja Telecaster comes equipped with high-quality chrome hardware, which includes an American Vintage 3-saddle strings-through-body bridge, a set of vintage-style tuners, and a 4-bolt neck plate engraved with \"Custom Shop Designed\". Comes complete with deluxe gig bag.Get your Fender Classic Player Baja Telecaster Electric Guitar today at the guaranteed lowest price from Sam Ash Direct with our 45-day return and 60-day price protection policy.
