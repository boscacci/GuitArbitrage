{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1998 Epiphone 335 Dot Electric GuitarAn exceptional instrument with some pedigree. This guitar was used on several North American tours (including performances at the Hollywood Bowl, and Red Rocks amphitheater) and multiple internationally-released recordings (Admiral Twin\u2019s \u201cMock Heroic\u201d, \u201cCreatures of Bread & Wine\u201d, and \u201cThe Center of the Universe\u201d. This guitar was hand-selected by Gibson/Epiphone and delivered to me as an official endorsement while I was touring the country. So it was not your standard \u201coff the assembly line\u201d guitar. It was originally set-up by engineer and platinum-selling artist Steve Ripley (The Tractors, Van Halen, Bob Dylan, Kramer guitars, et al). It was used on several recordings made at The Church Studio (Leon Russell's former studio). This is a much-loved instrument with a lot of history. The original tuners were replaced with Grovers. The truss rod cover has been missing for years. And there seems to be a piece of one of the truss rod cover screws still imbedded in a screw hole. The \"Epiphone\" logo is no longer on the heavily used pick guard. The body has some light scratches, etc, and the hardware has wear and tear as would be expected from an item of this vintage. The pots and guitar jack may or may not be scratchy. I say this because it's been in storage a while, and perhaps they could use some oil, but maybe not. It once had heavy use, and has been a much-loved instrument. It could use some TLC, a new setup, strings, etc. It as been in storage the last few years, and while I hate to part with it, I need to make room for some new toys. The guitar comes with the original hardshell case. This item is being sold As-Is, so please check out all of the photos and ask any questions before bidding. PaPal only.
