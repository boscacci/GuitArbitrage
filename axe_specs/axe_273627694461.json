{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I have up for auction a 2014 Epiphone Custom Shop Limited Edition ES-335 Pro semi-hollow body electric guitar in excellent condition. The color is called \"Ice Tea Burst\". There are no dents or dings. There are a few very light marks on the guitar that are very hard to see. The pick guard originally came with a stick on \"E\" emblem on it that I removed. The pick guard does have some normal play marks. The pickups are Alnico Classic Pro humbuckers with coil splitting. You can split the coils on either humbucker by pulling up on the appropriate volume knob. As for the neck, it is a slim D style, similar to a 60\u2019s style profile. The guitar hasn\u2019t been played very much and never gigged. The neck is straight with no issues. The frets are in great shape with little to no wear. I am including a new $160 value SKB 335 hard case. The guitar originally did not come with a case. Take a look at my feedbacks and buy with confidence.
