{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you are wanting an excellent synth guitar fully loaded with stereo output on Magnetic and Piezo in addition to separate Synth output then here is your chance well under a $1000.I had bought this last year knowing it had a few things that needed correcting but the body was in excellent shape. I do not like to sell anything less than100% which now I can say it has been restored. The up and down step switch was not working and had to replace the switch, the output smart jack, and the modular board on the synth.She sounds great and plays like a guitar three times the price. Great deal for an incredible guitar! This Brian Moore i2000 Series iGuitar 8.13. is a beautiful Vintage Sunburst. Made in Korea but all Brian Moore's are closely inspected in their New York facility. It has locking tuners. Body is in very good shape with a some normal wear such as very small marks on the neck and very light scratches on the back that the camera cannot pick up. Neck is perfectly straight. Frets have minimum wear but a lot of wear left. I love Brian Moore guitars and currently have 4 Custom Shop and this i2000. This sports the curved body and where the TRS or 1/4inch cable plugs in on the back. Electronics are fully functional. Great feel and sound. The stereo output for the magnetic and Piezo works properly as well as the synth. Synth tracks perfectly and the down function works but the up is not working. Locking Sperzel tuners. The finish is exquisite and really makes an impression. Comes with a very nice Wolfpack case.sn is M02114115Product Specs Condition: Very Good (Used) Brand: Brian Moore Model: i2000 Series iGuitar 8.13 Finish: Vintage Sunburst Categories: Solid Body Made In: Korea, Republic of", "ItemID": "163486800560", "EndTime": "2019-01-18T01:11:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T14:08:44.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Brian-Moore-i2000-Synth-Guitar-and-stereo-output-Mag-piezo-/163486800560", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lewisville, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634868005608080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/ezgAAOSwDsZcPJhX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/RK4AAOSwWrxcPJcn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/a6UAAOSw76JcPJc2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/9-8AAOSwj91cPI8D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/PKAAAOSw7HhcPI8A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/15kAAOSw0TBcPI76/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/bxgAAOSwHglcPI79/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/wDkAAOSwl1FcPI8N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/KXcAAOSw~JFcPJFv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/kkgAAOSw27lcPJcU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/6I8AAOSwYX9cPJcd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "75077", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sel1754", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 563, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 625.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 625.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***5", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 315}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Brian Moore i2000 Synth Guitar and stereo output Mag/piezo", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Brian Moore"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["i2000 8.13"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Vintage Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 58, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good condition all electronics 100%", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
