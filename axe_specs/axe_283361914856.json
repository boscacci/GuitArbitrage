Search for Matt Flynn Cedarcaster Partscaster This Telecaster style partscaster is one of two red cedar bodies that I built with leftover lumber from a garage door project. It has a very vibrant acoustic sound, so it's great for practice around the house without an amp. It's inspired by the Fender Road Worn series in copper. It's a copper metallic enamel finish with a Mohawk clear gloss nitrocellulose finish. It's a very light guitar, and cedar is a soft wood so it will develop a lot of characte r over time. The neck is a generic import that I leveled and set up, and is surprisingly nice. It's about 15/16th inches at the 12th fret, and feels closer to a 50's C or medium C, but definitely not a modern C shape. I'm not sure of the fretboard wood, but it is sanded to it's natural color with two layers of tung oil finish. I finished it with an amber nitrocellulose finish for a more vintage look. The bridge and pickups are Wilkinson, which I think are excellent quality and a good value. I'm very reponsive to questions, so please feel free to ask any. I will be setting a reserve price. I like this guitar a lot, but need to thin out my collection and I plan to build a 3rd with the proceeds. It will be for sale locally so I reserve to right to cancel the auction if the reserve hasn't been met.
