{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "She needs some loving and I haven't the means to provide anymore. As you'll note in the picture, the flat chrome neck plate that reads in small script \"made in Japan\" in all caps is our best clue as to production date. Serial numbers were all screwy at this point, and it's very possible we're not provided all the information we need with the one available on the back of the headstock. In my limited research though I discovered that it's definitely one of the very first run to come out of Japan in the early-mid 80's and that the supposed \"expert\" advice was to contact BC Rich directly. So here we are... Soft, faux fur lined WELL padded gig bag included. All electronics original and in tested working order. Original yellow paint, for what it's worth. Here's the other thing though. You'll notice some dings and dents(?) in the pics. Missing truss cover, impacts on every horn, neck pit had the usual marks of a 30+ year old BC, and the horn pit even has an abrasion. So I won't go asking the price I could if it were minty, ya know?", "ItemID": "163378532255", "EndTime": "2018-11-17T00:12:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-17T00:09:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/BC-Rich-Bich-80s-electric-guitar-/163378532255", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "York, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633785322558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/faAAAOSwukZb6z6v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/3DAAAOSw-GNb6z6x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/GwAAAOSwCgVb6z6y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/GacAAOSwBfhb6z60/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BeYAAOSwYCRb6z62/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/uB8AAOSwcBZb6z64/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/JgsAAOSwQ25b6z65/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ytgAAOSwu9Jb6z67/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/QMoAAOSw8cFb6z69/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/whEAAOSwjlVb6z6~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "17401", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ricgeoghega_0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 616, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.7}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 823}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "BC Rich Bich 80's electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["B.C.
