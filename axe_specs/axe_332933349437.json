{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "In an effort to \"thin the herd\", up for auction is my 2003 Pewter Fender Cyclone HH. This guitar is in very good shape with one exception. It has the \"finish crack\" in the polyester paint(see photo). The body underneath is solid. It is something that happens to this type of \"paint\" when it expands and contracts(possibly from shipping or storage). I received the guitar in this condition. If this is something you are unsure of, please refrain from bidding. I have owned the instrument for a few years and it has always been in home only use in a smoke free environment. The frets have good life left and the guitar works as it should both mechanically and electronically. Included in the auction/ sale is a Fender factory hard-case. (see photos). Please review the photographs before bidding as they are a key part of the description. To guarantee prompt shipment, this item will need to be paid for on or before 4:00pm Eastern standard time December 17th 2018. Any payments after said date/ time and the item will be shipped out the first week of January, 2019. I will be unavailable for shipping during this time.
