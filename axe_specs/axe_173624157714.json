{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The Fender So-Cal Strat was in production for only a few months across 2005/2006. A special edition Stratocaster tribute to the famous Southern California hot-rod & speed shop, opened in 1946 by Alex Xydias as a motor enthusiast's parts store, in the north Hollywood suburb of Burbank. The business has subsequently grown to include three west coast stores, two in Canada, plus Phoenix, Las Vegas and another on the US east coast.Designed by the Fender Custom Shop to incorporate the sexy lines of Southern California\u2019s hot-rods and dragsters, plus the shop\u2019s famous red-and-white livery, the So-Cal Strat was a limited edition run that quickly sold out everywhere. Aside from the eye-catching artwork, the guitar is built like the classic racing machines \u2013 plain and simple, with just a single humbucker and a volume knob.Despite such barebones electrics, these are far from being one-trick ponies. That one volume knob is almost wizard-like in its ability to take your sound in a bunch of different directions. See video in listing for demo of tones.Beneath the red-and-white livery lurks a regular Maple Stratocaster neck and 22-fret Rosewood board. The gleaming silver foil Fender logo and chrome hardware make the headstock its own work of art. And, obviously, that bee-sting-point up the fingerboard \u2013 it really makes the guitar go that much faster!FEATURES\u2022Basswood body\u2022Custom two-tone paint(Red/White)\u2022Bolt-on, C-shaped maple neck\u2022Rosewood fretboard\u2022Alnico humbucker\u2022Hard-tail bridge\u202222 jumbo frets\u2022Volume control\u2022Chrome hardware\u202225-1/2\" scale length\u20221.625\" nut width\u2022Graphite nut\u2022So-Cal Speed Shop decal on body\u2022Oversized strap buttonsAlso a custom LTD case that it comes with.
