{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is in mint condition. I purchased it new in 2012 and it has had minimal use (about 5 gigs) and has largely sat in its case in my closet. Great sound and plays beautifully. No scratches or wear on the guitar and comes with original hard shell case. I just have found that I really don't play it as I am primarily an acoustic player and play solo mostly these days. I hate to see instruments sit unused. Model 2012 LSD26HYCH3. Buyer pays all shipping. 30 days return accepted. Final shipping charge depends on location and will be calculated when item sells. Message me if you want more info/photos. US shipping only.

From the web:The arrival of the Gibson Les Paul Studio Electric Guitar in 1983 offered guitarists all the essential elements of a Les Paul Standard, including a carved top and humbucking pickups. The Les Paul Studio Deluxe II '60s Electric Guitar raises the bar with the cutting-yet-rich tone of a 490R humbucking pickup in the neck position and a BurstBucker Pro humbucking pickup in the bridge position, which are mounted on a carved maple top with a mahogany back. Both pickups offer coil splitting for single-coil sounds and a boost circuit via push/push switching in the volume controls. Straight Split coil-splitting offers pure single coil tone and differs from LP Standards and Studios that have a Super Tap coil-tap, which still has a small amount of humbucking. The boost circuit has a user-adjustable 10-dB boost for added power and frequency range.The hardware is finished in chrome including Grover tuners and Gibson's pioneering tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece. The Les Paul Studio Deluxe is dependable and affordable \u201d and is built without any compromises.
