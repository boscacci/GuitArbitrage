{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "**Read Full Description** Beautiful Epiphone les paul 1960 tribute plus with true Gibson 57\u2019 Classic Pickups. The top is gorgeous and in near mint condition, the mahogany body is near mint as well. This is one solid guitar. I had the neck sanded by a professional luthier to smooth the action and it\u2019s a huge difference. I hadn\u2019t used it much for months so I\u2019m October I decided to sell on Ebay. Unfortunately it arrived in a mangled box that looked like it was run over by a forklift. **Turns out the neck was broken (see photos)** and I\u2019ve been dealing with UPS for the last several months trying to get the claim covered. I took it to a local luthier that said it would cost $150-200 to fix but I\u2019m not planning on fixing it as I\u2019m actually looking to try a strat instead. Guitar Retails for $849 new. Asking $200 with no reserve as if you know how to fix it or know someone who can. Feel free to ask any questions and good luck bidding.On Jan-24-19 at 15:02:18 PST, seller added the following information: CASE INCLUDED!!!", "ItemID": "153349643779", "EndTime": "2019-01-26T02:15:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-23T02:15:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-1960-Tribute-Plus-/153349643779", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bellingham, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533496437798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/374AAOSw16VcR8Wn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XSsAAOSwCgtcR8WS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rwoAAOSwtYZcR8Wz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ad0AAOSw76JcR8Wf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sOYAAOSwmfhcR8Wg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/os0AAOSwpYxcR8WO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hBUAAOSwg1JcR8Wd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lUEAAOSwYwZcR8WY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/V-AAAOSwVNNcR8WW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WTUAAOSwW~JcR8Wc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5FoAAOSwjmRcR8Wi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98225", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "egb1emb2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 76, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***-", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul 1960 Tribute Plus", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul 1960 Tribute Plus"]}]}, "HitCount": 280, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
