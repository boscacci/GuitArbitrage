{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a pristine 2014 Gibson Les Paul Standard with AAA Premium Quilted top. This quilt was Hand selected and Book Matched By the best technicians that Gibson has. This finish is absolutely the most beautiful that I have ever seen from any brand, the Ocean Water Perimeter blue. A key point with this masterpiece of a guitar is that it is the \u201c2014\u201c model not the 2015 model with the extra wide neck and different Les Paul logo on the headstock. These specific 2014 models surely will become collector pieces. The top on this piece of art truly looks like streaming tropical ocean waters and has huge presence. Comes with a Hardshell Brown on pink Case and Case Candy. The photos do the talking on this one. This easily stands side to side of any PRS private stock artist series some that cost over $10,000. The fit, finish, feel and tone is absolutely second to none. This is as good as a guitar gets. These premium standard guitars are put together by the best technicians that Gibson has. When you hold this masterpiece, feel it, hear it and play it you will be blown away. Guitar sounds glorious and has the best tone woods that Gibson has to offer. I did my best to photograph this beauty in as many variations of lighting as I can. from fluorescent lights, to halogen to natural sunlight so you can see the majestic beauty of this work of art in all lighting. But I definitely have to say the pictures don\u2019t do the justice when you pop open the case, your heart will skip a beat. Guitars like this one rarely or never come up for sale. Grab this one while it\u2019s available. You will receive the paperwork as well. Guitar is in excellent condition. All items come as is, as pictured, check photos are they look great! Any questions don\u2019t hesitate to ask!! The Gibson 2014 Les Paul Standard Premium Quilt Electric Guitar celebrates Gibson\u2019s 120th Anniversary in style.
