{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello. My name is Jerry and I am a guitar-aholic. I never played a guitar I didn't want to take home. My compulsion is to shop in the best guitar stores and internet guitar sites I have traveled out of state just to guitar shop and spent hours on the internet looking for just the right guitar\u2026just the right deal. It must have been a conquest thing because after I bought them, I typically placed them in the case and stacked them in the guitar room thinking one day I would need that guitar. I have acquired over 50 guitars mostly Gibson, Fender. It was a great ride, but it\u2019s over. When I turned 67 last year I decided to retire. I am too old to keep chasing these young guitars so I have decided to help them find new homes. I have about a dozen guitars that I am keeping because they remind me of the old days and the old bands. The rest are up for sale. Some of the guitars I will be selling are like right out of the box and right in to my guitar-room new. Others I bought to upgrade and play.This guitar is in excellent shape. The neck is straight, no fret wear and the strings are low and loose. I noticed a small nick under the bridge that is hard to find but no other noticeable nicks and scrapes. I have several guitars and I played this one very little. This is a Gibson Les Paul Special with an up grade of Joe Barden humbucker dual sound pick ups. The guitar originally came with the hot P90 pick ups which will be included in the gig bag. The P90 and full humbucker are easily changed without extra cutting or shaping. I bought the Joe Barden pick ups to see if they were as good as people say. They are! Using a TS9 or other overdrive pedal you can get clean lasting sustain not unlike a steel guitar. Add a volume pedal and you have all sorts of options. The Barden pick ups are also wired for single coil sound via a push pull pot. They cost $400+ and the guitar I bought new in 2012 was street price $999. Comes with the Gibson gig bag. Look at the pictures. Note that some pictures have the reflection of grass and not scratches. Ask any questions. No refunds. No international bidders, please. Will ship Fed EX to US (48 states) destinations only. Please use PayPal. Thanks for looking.On Dec-26-18 at 07:19:11 PST, seller added the following information: The original Gibson P90 pickups, see image, come with the guitar and are easily reinstalled with no alterations to the guitar. The humbuckers and P90 pick ups are interchangeable.", "ItemID": "143059648257", "EndTime": "2018-12-28T02:00:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T02:00:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Special-w-Joe-Barden-Upgrades-/143059648257", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Christiansburg, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430596482578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0ZsAAOSwIKNcHB5y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/lDEAAOSwSONcHB59/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/L0EAAOSwwTFcHB6I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X-AAAOSwzgtcHB6a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oowAAOSwcqxcHB6l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g8EAAOSwe9FcHB6z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eqcAAOSw0wJcHB7A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/Pk4AAOSwMg5cHB7J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/WS8AAOSwHGJcHB7W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/GTAAAOSwcH5cHB73/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/m~sAAOSwxDJcI5tq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "24068", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lite1957", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 38, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 713.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 713.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 243}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Special w Joe Barden Upgrades", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Les Paul solid body"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["LP Special"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Dark aged cherry"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 877, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 723.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
