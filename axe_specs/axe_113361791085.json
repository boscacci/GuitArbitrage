{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Folks, this is the piece de resistance! 1983 Fullerton AVRI \u201857 Reissue Stratocaster in near mint / mint condition. Serial No. V011756. A December 1983 and exceptionally clean example in beautiful, pristine Custom Color Lake Placid Blue, among the rarest Custom Color of this series. This particular reissue Strat has, in fact, the best Lake Placid Blue finish I have ever seen on a Fender reissue guitar, ever. Overall, the instrument is a 9.5 in my book. This guitar is in spectacular condition and appears to have very little play wear. There is no buckle rash, dings or noticeable dents, scrapes, etc. A very small spot appears on the second fret where part of the nitrocellulose lacquer has worn a bit--please see the photos. I try to deal in only the best items possible, and this instrument is no exception. Adding to this guitar's rarity and extremely resonant sound is (1) it weighs only 7 pounds; and (2) it is one of the very rare Fenders from this period to have a two-piece body! This guitar absolutely RINGS with \"bell tone.\" Neck dates to 12-22-83. The neck is straight and the frets have next to zero wear. The neck is excellent, a typical thin C-shape from this era. Back of the neck is perfect as are the headstock and tuning keys. Neck is stamped \"J. Garcia\". All solder joints look original, except for the factory-supplied 5-way switch which was installed. The 3 Black Bottom pickups measure: Neck 5.88 ohms; Middle 5.82ohms; and Bridge 5.62 ohms. Pots are dated 1983; CTS 250 K 1378330 (30th weekof 1983). Original 3-way switch is included, as are the original vibrato arm, Fender guitar strap, ashtray bridge cover, manual, case key, bridge height-adjustment Allen wrench, Fender polishing cloth, Fender envelope, tremolo springs envelope, and original warranty form (signed, but never mailed to Fender). Original tweed \"duckfoot\" case is in excellent condition with all latches in good working order. The winning bidder will get the best, lightest and most resonant Lake Placid Blue '57 AVRI Reissue Stratocaster I've ever come across. Very difficult to find in such nice condition. These are only going up in value. Why am I selling? I have a Federal tax bill I need to pay off. No reserve auction. Please trust my feedback and bid with confidence. Shipping to Continental U.S. and Canada only. Shipping to USA will be $99.95. Guitar and case included as described. Other items shown in pictures are not include included in this auction.
