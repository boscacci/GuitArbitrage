There's a lot to love about the simplicity of the Ibanez Komrad20RS Head Signature guitar. Ibanez Komrad20RS Head Signature 7-string Electric Guitar at a Glance:Upgraded to Red Dimarzio Blaze Pickups. Fast, comfortable feel and long-term reliability from the Wizard II-7 neckThere's no speed limit when you're playing one of Ibanez's Wizard necks, and the Komrad20RS 7-string is no exception. This neck is built to survive a long gigging career, too, thanks to the 3-piece maple construction. Multiply necks are stronger and more rigid than single-piece necks, which means they resist warping and bending better. No-frills guitar for a no-frills guitaristAs one of the founding members of Korn, Head's guitar playing has always focused on the vibe and groove of the song rather than flashy fretwork or boutique equipment. The Ibanez Komrad20RS Head Signature guitar reflects this straightforward pragmatism, giving you everything you need to rock hard without any unwanted frills. All Head needs to create his monster tone is an expressive pair of humbuckers, volume and tone controls, and rock-solid reliability. If you dig Head's style and philosophy, then the Ibanez Komrad20RS Head Signature Model may very well be your ideal guitar.", "ItemID": "401678235079", "EndTime": "2019-01-03T23:29:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T06:50:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Komrad20-RS-Red-Splatter-KORN-Head-Welch-7-string-w-Deluxe-Hard-Case-/401678235079", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Smith, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/4016782350798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/wJYAAOSwQUJbJy4B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DF0AAOSwO9RbJy4E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/2jsAAOSwwTlbJy4J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/sR4AAOSwbzVbJy4M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/jAsAAOSwi0RbJy4R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/6N8AAOSwrWVbJy4X/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/B8gAAOSwpchbJy4a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/NDoAAOSw92RbJy4f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/JJgAAOSw8FBbJy4h/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "72903", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "musiciansguitaroutletonline", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4569, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 695.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 695.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": ".***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Komrad20 RS Red Splatter KORN Head Welch 7 string w/ Deluxe Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black and Red"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 14, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=19967720", "StoreName": "Musicians Guitar Outlet"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Asia", "Middle East", "Southeast Asia", "RU"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent Condition!!
