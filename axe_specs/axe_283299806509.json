{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Collings I35 LC Bill Collings' and his shop in Austin, Texas has been building some of the finest acoustic guitars for decades and has recently turned his attention to electric guitars. The result has been nothing short of astonishing. He has reinvigorated the industry with his take on classic design. The Collings I-35 is their reinterpretation of the semi-hollow body, two-pickup guitar. The I-35 LC is the result of a custom laminated construction technique that Bill Collings and his R&D team developed in pursuit of the best tonal qualities of vintage semi-hollow guitar design. When crafting instruments designed to be used electrically at higher volumes, the resonant qualities of a guitar need a high degree of focus to achieve some of the classic semi-hollow guitar tones. The I-35 LC is the first of a line of laminate instruments designed to respond acoustically in perfect harmony with their electronics. Custom crafted in house for each guitar, the Collings laminate line has provided another unique way for them to voice their instruments for superior response and tone. The I-35 LC features a custom laminate maple top, sides and back and an all mahogany neck. The I-35 LC is among Collings most articulate and versatile electric models. The I35's mahogany neck is superior quality wood and topped off with a Rosewood Fretboard with MOP Dot inlays. The profile is a comfortable \"C\" shape with rounded edges, giving it a wonderful, broken in feel. Leaving no detail untouched, the Gotoh tuners have grained-ivoroid buttons. You owe it to yourself to come in and plug this guitar into any of our Carr amplifiers and finally stop searching for the \"tone\", it has arrived! This Pre-Owned Guitar is in Very Good Condition with only light towel marks throughout the guitar, and some light scratches on the pickups.
