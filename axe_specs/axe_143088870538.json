{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Tacoma Papoose (P1) Acoustic Guitar(Early Model)This Papoose P1 is in pristine condition. Absolutely looks, feels and plays like it's brand new! It has always been kept in a climate controlled environment. The neck is straight as an arrow. You will find no flaws whatsoever in this beautiful, like-new Tacoma Papoose P1. Very sought after guitar! This portable guitar is tuned to \"A\" (A to A). It acts like a normal guitar with a capo on the 5th fret. The Papoose P1 is exceptionally well made with solid mahogany back and sides and a thick solid cedar top. The neck is made of mahogany with a rosewood fingerboard. Its distinctive chiming has that mandolin-type sound adding very rich high-end harmonics. The construction allows this little guitar to produce a full, loud sound that adds considerable fullness and character when played along with other instruments in your band or it sounds just as robust and full when played alone. It comes with the original soft travel case, original paperwork and a brand new set (as of 1/11/19) of Elixir 10/47 Extra Light 80/20 Bronze strings. I have displayed many pictures for your examination. Please, look through them carefully and you'll see how perfect it is. Guitar stand is not included.
