{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Epiphone FLYING V2016 / Electric Guitar w/ Gigbag made in 1993Item Description Manufacturer: Epiphone Model: FLYING V2016 Age: 1993 Made in 1993From GIBSON's affiliated brand EPIPHONE FLYING V!EPIPHONE FLIYNG V which is unknown in many places! There is a description of GIBSON on the rod cover and I get a little luxurious impression!Clean ~ One well handleable balance well to overdrive! Overall there are scratches, dent marks, feeling of use. The effectiveness of the truss rod is good, and there is a margin to sufficiently adjust both the forward warp correction direction and the reverse warp correction direction. The warp of the neck is already adjusted with a rod, it is almost straight. Although it can be seen that the thinness of the fret is thin, it remains in sufficient condition and there is no problem in the performance in particular.", "ItemID": "113466656157", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T03:50:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T08:16:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-FLYING-V2016-Electric-Guitar-w-Gigbag-made-1993-/113466656157", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Japan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134666561578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/AIcAAOSw-QxcGf3F/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/JQwAAOSwvGZcGf3J/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/2hQAAOSwvfpcGf3Q/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/iwUAAOSwFs1cGf27/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/toAAAOSwpLVcGf2-/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/UScAAOSwEfVcGf3N/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/9GYAAOSwHGxcGf3B/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/ZR4AAOSwiwZcGf3V/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDU4MA==/z/tzEAAOSw5bxcGf3Z/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tresurejapan", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 95.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 549.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 549.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 555}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone FLYING V2016 / Electric Guitar w/ Gigbag made in 1993", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone FLYING V2016"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["FLYING V2016"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1993"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 194, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1630866429", "StoreName": "tresurejapan"}, "Country": "JP", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money back or replacement (buyer's choice)", "ReturnsWithin": "60 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["BO", "PE", "IQ", "TR", "YE", "AZ", "JP", "TJ"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Overall this guitar has scratches, dents and feeling.The effectiveness of the truss rod is good, and there is a margin to sufficiently adjust both the forward warp correction direction and the reverse warp correction direction.The warp of the neck is already adjusted with a rod, it is a straight condition.Although it can be seen that the thinness of the fret is thin, it remains in sufficient condition and there is no problem in the performance in particular.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
