{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE 1967 Fender Mustang Bass Ser.# 273008. When I acquired this bass around 2006 it had had some modifications including the installation of a P-Bass pickup and knobs and had been refinished. It plays great and sounds huge. It\u2019s only been played on a couple of local gigs just to try it out. It\u2019s been sitting in my studio in a case for the last twelve years and needs a new home. As you can see, it came with a little bit of cosmetic corrosion on some of the screws and keys and a few small dings that it had when I got it. The frets are in good shape. It has a slight hum that a guitar tech (or you) can easily address, probably from the pickup not having been properly grounded on installation. I haven\u2019t gotten it repaired because I haven\u2019t used the bass in a while and am moving soon and lack the time to address it. It\u2019s a very nice compact instrument and a good addition to any player\u2019s collection.", "ItemID": "143042234006", "EndTime": "2018-12-11T20:23:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-06T20:23:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1969-Fender-Mustang-Bass-/143042234006", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "State College, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430422340068080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODk=/z/g70AAOSwx-lb8uX8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kgAAAOSwK1Rb8uYK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~agAAOSwORxb8uYZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G-EAAOSwjt1b8uYv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZzoAAOSwcDdb8uY5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9wwAAOSwydZb8uZJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ed0AAOSwIddb8uZa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MsoAAOSw2-pb8uZn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/838AAOSwSSdb8uZ2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "16801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pbarsom", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 99, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 552.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 552.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5310}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1969 Fender Mustang Bass", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["4 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Mustang Bass"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1967"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1969"]}]}, "HitCount": 171, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 562.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
