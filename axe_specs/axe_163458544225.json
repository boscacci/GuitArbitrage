{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Stratocaster Surf Green 69 Styled Relic My guitars are beautifully unique Art pieces and music makers. Each one is designed and built to represent an Icon from the past. They are built with the best parts; commensurate with the price you pay. As a Wounded Warrior, I place integrity, know how, lots of time and love into each of them, as this is also a form of therapy for me. See my feedback, I've been at this hobby for a while. Included with your purchase is a ChromaCast Padded Gig Bag ($50.00) and Fender Custom Shop custom care packet, Owners manual, registration card, hang tags, appropriate tremolo bar, allen wrenches and tremolo back plate - (if needed)! Thanks for looking & check out my other STRATS and Fender parts for sale! For your consideration is this Custom hand restored Stratocaster. I've Styled this after a 1969 Stratocaster with the F plate, Maple neck, Large Headstock and 57/62 pickups. BODY: The Surf Green body has been finished with all the road worn imperfections that would normally come with a fifty-year-old well-played guitar. It has a hand aged CREAM pick guard contrasted with aged cream and white pick up covers and switch tip. The knobs are real natural old Fender. ELECTRONICS: The Heart has upgraded pickups and electronics. The pick up\u2019s are True Custom Shop 57/62 copper wound Alinco II's fiber bottoms and the wiring is done to vintage 60's specifications. They are staggered, beveled-edge Alnico magnets with formvar wire designed to deliver the original vintage Strat sound, feel, and vibe. It has upgraded new Seymour Duncan Bourns Smooth Taper 250K Split Shaft Speed Pots on the volume and tone, and the capacitor is NOS vintage Fender Bright Orange Dime .022 uF. All 5-tone switch positions are distinct and clear; the 2 tone pots work correctly with their corresponding pick-ups. NECK: It's built in the late sixties (CBS) tribute style with a Fender one piece MAPLE neck with a Large CBS headstock, a soft \"C\" profile, with a single string tree and decal from the 69-71 era. The neck is 22 Frets, 10\" radius and straight and is matched to a vintage fender tremolo big block with the wider USA spacing of 2 3/16. The tuners are also vintage Kluson style. Neck has many natural finger burn/sweat areas, showing that this neck was well played and loved. I always setup the neck (truss rod), frets and strings to minimize the string height and fret buzz while keeping the neck as straight as allowed. The neck plays low and easy, with a complete new setup to an average string height of 1/16 at the 12th fret. I've added new Ernie Ball super slinky .09 strings, and then completed a bridge adjustment for perfect string height and playability. Like Eric Clapton said during his interview on his guitar \"Brownie\": What I would always look for on a Strat, was a maple neck that had been wore out. You know it was like a restaurant, if there\u2019s lots of people in there, you know there\u2019s got to be good food, so I know I just thought that if it all those kind of worn out patches, it meant that it had been, you know, well favored.\u201d - and this ones been \"Favored\" like a rock and roll work horse and looks the part at a fraction of the cost. Weighing in at 7.75 lbs. I\u2019m a Wounded Warrior and have been rescuing and rebuilding guitars for the last ten years, as a form of therapy. One too many several explosions left me wrapped too tight, (majoranthonyjones.com.) Now, I exercise my brain by playing and rebuilding guitars. I\u2019m wrapped pretty tight so I\u2019m OCD about getting my guitars as perfect as I can, within reason, so you\u2019re definitely getting your moneys worth! RETURNS are NOT ACCEPTED - BUT if you contact me immediately, (7 days) and have not opened or modified the guitar, I will accept return & Buyer pays shipping.
