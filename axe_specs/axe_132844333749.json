{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The guitar was originally a 1994 Gibson les Paul standard that was a Brunswick bowling ball blue.. something in the 400 unit range of being made and painted by Tom Murphy. The changes that was made since it was stripped included the following: Correct gold top finish with bronze powder Duncan Set of 59 custom classic hybrids Tone pros hardware Nitro finish New fretboard Dark brown finish on the back of the body Real pearl trapezoid inlays 50\u2019s style wiring with PIO Mandalorian Inlay on the headstock think Bounty hunter from Star Wars I had a professional shop refinish the guitar. It\u2019s structurally sound and plays fantastic!! I am selling as is.. so please ask every question you can think. I will try and answer them for you. There is a few things that could never be returned back to new.. the neck heel was a bit rounded from a previous owner.. the neck is slightly thinner than a 60\u2019s. None of this bothered me as I wanted to have it naturally relic over time. Includes a SKB hardshell case.", "ItemID": "132844333749", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T17:10:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T17:10:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/gibson-les-paul-standard-goldtop-/132844333749", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Winfield, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328443337498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EiwAAOSwz5Nb3ych/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VDkAAOSwzGBb3ycq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1U8AAOSwnWpb3ycW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dHEAAOSw9E5b3yc~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gmAAAOSwVRBb3ydK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kSAAAOSwhspb3yc2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDcyMA==/z/ZN8AAOSw3ANb5LKO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/AWAAAOSwLSZb5LL1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/~tIAAOSwdr1b5LNQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "25213", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "joshmc5150", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 138, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 103}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "gibson les paul standard goldtop", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 783, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
