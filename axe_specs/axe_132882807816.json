{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hard Luck Kings, Lady Luck, Explorer body style, beautiful gold finish, 24 frets, includes HLK custom hard case. Plays great, sounds great & looks great I have weighed the guitar at 8.5 lbs, I would say that the neck is slim to medium, to me it feels slim/fast but not quite as slim as a 1960s Classic les paul neck for example, I have played every fret of every string & noticed a buzz on the 15th fret of the A string, there are no sharp edges on the frets, they were filed at the factory, there are some light abrasive marks on the edge of the fretboard from filing, the current setup is the factory setup, it\u2019s fairly low & comfortable although it may could be tweaked a little to your preference, it plays nice as it is with no issues other than stated. Holds tune well & the tuning gear ratio feels nice w/no slips. Disclosure! Volume cuts in and out, was received that way from the factory, was told by my local luthier that it\u2019s probably just a Potentiometer, which is $3-$7 for most online. Haven\u2019t gotten around to getting it fixed and selling as is. I am the original owner and have only played this guitar lightly at home as part of a large collection, check out my other items for sale and thanks for looking!
