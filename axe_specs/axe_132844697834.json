You are looking at a 2017 Charvel Pro-Mod San Dimas Style 2 HH. Charvel's have long been known as the pinnacle in Shred Guitars. This Pro Mod Style 2(PM SD2) is a AWESOME playing and sounding guitar. If you like playing fast with an aggressive tone, this is the right guitar for you. PERFORMANCE The Pro-Mod San Dimas Style 2 HH HT M Ash feels like a wild bucking horse because once you strap yourself in, you can\u2019t help but hang on as your playing heads toward break neck speed. It\u2019s mind blowing and addictive how the guitar changes the character of my playing to accommodate fast runs and wicked riffs. Its speed neck profile with a hand-rubbed urethane gel back finish is so smooth it allows your fingers to effortlessly skate across the whole neck. Charvel was wise to use the darker-voiced Seymour Duncan humbuckers to balance the ash body\u2019s brighter tone characteristics. Here, the pickups have a strong mid-range that makes chords sound chunky when using high-gain amplifiers, while leads have the perfect bite and roundness that slice through the mix. Engaging the volume\u2019s push/pull coil split brightens up the tone for single coil spank. It\u2019s a totally versatile hard rock masterpiece stripped down for dexterous guitar acrobatics. From The Web: Pedigreed shredders from the \u201880s, Pro-Mod San Dimas\u00ae guitars are packed with high-speed playability and innovative design elements that epitomize Charvel\u2019s definitive combination of time-honored style and modern features, power and performance. The Pro-Mod San Dimas Style 2 HH FR QM offers an alder body with quilt maple top and a two-piece bolt-on maple neck with graphite reinforcement rods for rock-solid stability, despite the ravages of the road and climate. Engineered for effortlessly nimble and highly-expressive playing, this guitar has a speed neck profile, a 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius dark rosewood fingerboard with hand-rubbed urethane gel back finish, 22 jumbo frets, white dot inlays and a convenient thumbwheel truss rod butt-adjust for easy access. Hot-rodded for unparalleled performance and versatile sound, this instrument is equipped with a high-output Seymour Duncan\u00ae JB TB-4 humbucking bridge pickup and a warm, fat Seymour Duncan\u00ae \u201959 SH-1N humbucking neck pickup for killer tone, controlled with a three-way blade switch. The volume control hides a push/pull coil split for even more highly useful tonal variations\u2014ideal for everything from a biting lead sound to thick, chunky rhythm work, while the No-Load tone control operates like a standard tone control from positions one through nine, removing itself from the circuit at position ten for transparent sound, letting the full natural voice of the guitar shine through.
