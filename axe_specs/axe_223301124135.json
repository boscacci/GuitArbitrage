{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Nice Clean Fender Deluxe Series Nashville Telecaster made in Mexico Beautiful transparent finish with lots of nice grain in the ash body. The overall condition is excellent with just one small ding near the input jack which is detailed in the photos. Other than the ding the guitar is in near mint condition. The ding does not effect the sound, performance or the playability of the guitar in any way shape or form. If this is the kind of thing that will bother you it would probably be best for you to pass on this guitar. The frets are shiny and super smooth with no fret wear and the neck is good and straight. The guitar came stock with a tortoise pickguard and a white pickup cover on the middle pickup. The previous owner had the black pickguard and an aged middle pickup cover installed. The original tortoise pickguard and original pickup cover are included with the guitar. Both of the pickguards still have the original plastic covering on them.\u00a0 Everything on the guitar works as it should and it plays and feels really nice.\u00a0 Full specs are listed at the bottom of this page The last\u00a0picture is of the guitar all boxed and ready to ship. Shipping details are as follows: 22 lbs packed, dimensions are 46x19x7 I only charge actual shipping costs If the actual price is less than the estimated cost quoted through ebay I ALWAYS REFUND the balance, If the cost is more then I pay the difference.
