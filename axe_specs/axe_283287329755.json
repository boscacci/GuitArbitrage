Photo shows condition- took few angles to reduce glare questions. tuners need polish, have some tarnish. Look at my pics, you can see the dust. there is no wear on the frets and foam still under bridge. Beautiful, cool guitar: cheap. tires and rent can wait. ES-175The legendary ES-175 is the \u201cbridge\u201d guitar between the old world and the new. Featuring a Florentine cutaway and two Alnico Classic\u2122 humbucker pickups, the ES-175 has all the bark, bite, and projection of an archtop plus the complex tones that can only come from the combination of humbucker pickups and tone woods. The ES-175 originally debuted in 1949 and became instantly popular for offering players who sought the electric archtop \u201cWes Montgomery\u201d L-5 sound in a less expensive alternative. In 1957 when the ES-175 switched from single coil to humbucker pickups, it quickly became a favorite for guitarists in every genre and can be heard on scores of hit records. Three generations of players have made their mark on the ES-175 including Elvis Presley lead guitarist Scotty Moore, Pat Metheny, Joe Pass, and Green Day\u2019s Billy Joe Armstrong. The Epiphone ES-175 Reissue is a perfect fit for any player who wants the tone of an archtop with the reach of a Les Paul!
