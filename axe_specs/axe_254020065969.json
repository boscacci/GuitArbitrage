{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fantastic guitar in amazing condition. When not being played, I always kept the guitar in its case. No issues that I can see anywhere on the guitar and looks almost new. The tone and feel is exactly what you would expect from Eddie's signature guitar. Great big fat cleans and great distortion tones as well. It also includes a kill switch!! The pickups and simple tweaks that Eddie had made for this version of the Wolfgang are impressive and really put this model above all the rest.
