{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello, everyone. Today, I have a very rare and special treat for you! If you are looking at this post, you already know what it is. It is the heavier, very, very rare, non chambered and most highly regarded 2005 Gibson Les Paul Standard Limited Edition (only 300 made) in the most beautiful and sought after Manhattan Midnight Blue Burst. What you don\u2019t know is that this guitar is in excellent condition, and not just for a 14-year-old guitar, but for a guitar of any age, which, if you know this guitar, is very rare. These are getting harder and harder to find and this particular example shows little play, but please refer to the pictures. Original frets are polished and smooth and have 100% left. It comes with the OHSC case (the back latch is missing and can be replaced), original pickups, tuners, down to the strap buttons and everything else as well; guitar is all original and not modified in any way. Everyone knows that these early to mid 2000\u2019s were maybe the best years for Gibsons period, and that they don\u2019t make them like this any more. As interesting as that may sound for a 14-year-old guitar, there is NO buckle rash and the back looks great as does the rest of the guitar, but I\u2019ll let the pictures do the taking. It was purchased in 2005, set up, played for a period of time, and then put away in its case til now. It was cleaned periodically and stored in its case at all times. Honestly, it is very rare coming across this particular Limited Edition Gibson Les Paul Standard from this year in this good of condition. It has the 60\u2019s slim neck that is not as slim as these newer slim taper necks, but it is definitely thinner than 50\u2019s necks. It is medium weight, weighing in at about 9lbs. The tone and sustain is simply ridiculous, but I\u2019ll let you be the judge. Unplugged, the strings ring out loudly and endlessly and is well above average and this is the way I determine the quality of my Gibsons. If it sound good unplugged, it\u2019s a keeper, and this one goes beyond that. Plugged in to my Marshall SL5 it is a match made in heaven and being a non chambered model, the tone and sustain is second to none. It has been set up, the frets are polished and it is ready to rock. The hardware shows a little bit of tarnish, and there is a bit of amazing natural checking which only makes it look cooler and vintage. There are NO chips, and NO dings on this guitar and there is NO paint missing anywhere. The guitar is pretty much blemish free other then some normal swirls that is normal for a dark guitar and that can easily be buffed out if you wanted to make it look like a mirror again The top is absolutely amazing. Honestly, as stated before, here is that rare opportunity to purchase this 14-year-old, excellent condition Limited Edition Gibson Les Paul Standard from a great year at a really, really good price compared to what other people are selling these for when they do appear and in much, much worse condition. Don\u2019t let this one slip away as I know it will not last and I speak from experience. Due to the very attractive price, I know that I will be contacted a lot and with that said, I won\u2019t be able to hold the guitar for anyone; it\u2019ll be first come first serve. Furthermore, I reserve the right to end this sale at any time should my guitar sell locally or on other websites listed. I\u2019ve described this guitar to the best of my ability. Please ask any questions you may have and I\u2019ll try to answer in a timely manner.
