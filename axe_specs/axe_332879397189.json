{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "* Comes with hard shell caseA simple-to-use tone machine with a beautiful finish and perfectly-matched P-90-type pickups.The Ascari GTS broke new ground for G&L, and the team of Paul Gagon and Grover Jackson are back with a new flavor tha'll take you back without being another throwback. The Ascari GT-90 takes all the carefully designed architecture from the GTS and dials up P-90 tone that' better than ever. Typical P-90-equipped guitars suffer an imbalance between the neck and bridge pickups, forcing you to struggle with dual volume controls to find a balance. Not with the GT-90. Gagon has wound countless P-90 type pickups and used his deep understanding of pickup engineering to create an amazingly well-matched set. With a single volume control, a world of harmonically rich P-90 tone is finally accessible with ease. Such a guitar should have a classic look, and the Ascari GT-90 delivers with a rich, old-school Tobacco Sunburst finish over its cr\u00a8me-bound mahogany body and neck, reinforced by classic cr\u00a8me pickup covers, gold speed knobs and understated dot inlay. This is the P-90 guitar you\u2122ve dreamed of: superbly balanced tone in an incredibly well-balanced, lightweight instrument.
