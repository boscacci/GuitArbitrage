{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson Les Paul Standard 6-String Electric Guitar(94068211066 AGGG) Up for sale is a pre-owned Gibson Les Paul Standard 6-String Electric Guitar. This instrument is in excellent overall cosmetic condition, showing hardly any signs of use, and certainly nothing deep or anything that affects functionality. If you pick the guitar up and rotate it under a light source, you will see some pick and buckle marks in the lacquer, but it takes effort to see them. The bridge, neck, and tuners all look good, and the electronics have been tested and work great. Purchase includes (1) 2016 Gibson Les Paul Standard Guitar (Serial# 160099167 MADE IN THE USA) and original hard case ONLY, as shown. Please carefully review photos of actual item for sale and ask any questions you may have prior to purchase.
