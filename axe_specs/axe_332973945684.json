{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello and thank you for looking! Up for auction is a 2017 NAMM Show Exclusive Fender Heavy Relic Custom Shop Telecaster (USA) for Display to show the beauty and options possible from the Custom Shop. This is a gorgeous guitar and I put my name in for my chance to buy it. It has virtually no play wear, comes with all the original paperwork, hangtags, original hardshell case and shipping box. It features a stunning heavy relic \"Aged Lake Placid Blue over Blue Flower\" lacquer finish, a lightweight alder body, heavy relic tinted AA quartersawn maple neck with 1963 \"C\" back shape and 9.5\" radius rosewood fingerboard with 6105 frets and clay dots, a handwound Twisted Tele bridge pickup and an EVH Wolfgang humbucker in the neck, a reverse control plate with 3 way switch and modern wiring, including a stacked 250k/500k volume pot, 3 ply mint green pickguard, a '58/'63 Tele bridge with slotted steel saddle, vintage style tuners, and a bone nut. I'm happy to consider musical trades towards this tele, partial or full trade value, to make a deal work for you. I prefer anything guitar, amp or effects related since that is my passion. This is a killer guitar and we will check the setup and make sure everything is good to go before it ships out. I am happy to give a full money back guarantee if you send the guitar back in its original condition within 30 days. Please let me know if there was any shipping damage within 2 days of receiving it so I can file any claim promptly. I wouldn't expect any issues as I have experience shipping tens of thousands of guitars. Most importantly, I want to make sure you are happy with the purchase. I appreciate you considering this guitar and I wish you luck!
