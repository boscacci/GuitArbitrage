{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am the second owner of this guitar and it was made in 2002, I've had it since 2007. I haven't changed the strings in five years and every time I take it off the hook in my office it's perfectly in tune. The guitar is in excellent working order. The tuners, the tremelo and the fret board are in excellent shape for the age. The guitar simply doesn't have a lot of wear on it. I've never gigged with it, there were small dings in the finish when I got it but it didn't show any signs of heavy or live playing in 07' and it's unchanged since then. I paid $1400 eleven years ago. The finish is wearing well and still quite glossy, there is a repaired ding on the top towards the back of the guitar and the finish is matte there. This happened before I purchased the guitar, there is also one small belt ding underneath the bottom edge which I can only assume was done by me. Overall the guitar is in absolutely fabulous shape, but more importantly it plays and sounds as well as the day I got it. Please let me know if you have questions Serial Number: K23200 Bolt-on Neck Original hardware, no modifications.
