{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Please read entire description and bid accordingly. 2011 Fender Jaguar HH Blacktop Electric Guitar Silver w/ Bigsby Tremolo & Case6 string, Right Handed, Made in Mexico, SN MX11217975Solid body with Alder Body, Maple Neck, Rosewood Fingerboard, and Two Humbucking Pickups Very nice used guitar with light wear. Cool Silver color Guitar! The neck is straight and the frets look good. The black pick guard has scratches from normal play. The hardware has some areas where it has tarnished or peeled (see the pick-ups in pic #3).There are a few small marks/dings on the sides of the guitar-nothing at all obvious unless you get real close (pic #7). The bottom front edge has a small scratched area (see pic #5). The back of the guitar has visible scratches which I believe to be belt-rash. The tone knob is a bit loose, but at this time it is still working.A Roadrunner Hard Shell Case is included. The interior of the case is great, so the guitar is protected well. The vinyl on the outside of the case has tears and has been taped.All the buckles work as they should. Please see all the pictures as they are part of my description.
