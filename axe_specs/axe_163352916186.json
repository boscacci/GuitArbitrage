The Les Paul Traditional features a beautiful figured maple top, non-chambered, weight-relieved mahogany body and a mahogany neck with a comfortable '50s rounded shape. It's loaded with '57 Classic and '57 Classic Plus humbuckers for maximum tone and ample output. Set up and ready to go for maximum playability, the Les Paul Traditional lets you create your own musical history! Gibson Les Paul Traditional Solidbody Electric Guitar with Plus Top at a Glance: Classic tone, time-tested tonewoods Plek system setup Powerful, punchy pickups Classic tone, time-tested tonewoods Taking design and visual cues from the Les Pauls of the '80s, the Les Paul Traditional starts with an un-chambered mahogany body with traditional weight-relief holes for a beefy tone that maintains the resonance of modern Les Pauls. The body is capped with a carved maple top and the hand fitted neck tenon sports the rounded, C-shape profile common on the Les Pauls of the '80s and '90s. Plek system setup The Les Paul Traditional is Gibson USA's first model to utilize the revolutionary Plek system - a computer-controlled set-up that carefully measures and dresses each fret, accurately measuring the height between the fingerboard and each string, virtually eliminating string buzz and providing unbeatable playability. And of course your guitar will go through Sweetwater's setup process as well, ensuring a flawless playing instrument the moment you get it in your hands. Powerful, punchy pickups Two of Gibson's best-loved humbuckers - a '57 Classic in the neck position, and a '57 Classic Plus in the bridge - give the Traditional the power, punch, and clarity of Gibson's legendary PAF pickups. Other traditional appointments include vintage-style Gibson speed knobs, classic Kluson-style tuners by TonePros, which offer period-correct looks with a higher tuning ratio, and a chrome Nashville Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar.
