{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Our eBay Store About Us Epiphone Les Paul Standard Electric Guitar (Pelham Blue) Epiphones history with legendary guitarist and innovator Les Paul dates back to the early 1940s when Les, working late at night at the Epiphone factory on 14th Street in New York City, created what might have been the worlds first solidbody electric guitar, better known as \"The Log.\" Over the years, Les continued to work closely with Epiphone luthiers reviewing new product ideas and offering suggestions. \u201cEpiphone always made a good guitar,\u201d Les often said.The Epiphone Les Paul Standard has all of the features that have made the Les Paul one of the icons of rock. It has the same set neck construction as any of the classic Gibson Les Pauls, so that the neck and body act as a single piece of wood. This, along with the dense mahogany body with a maple top gives the Epiphone Les Paul Standard the rich tone and long sustain players have come to expect from a fine Les Paul guitar. You also get the classic look of white binding around the body and neck.Like other classic Les Pauls, the Epiphone Les Paul Standard has a pair of great sounding humbucking pickups with powerful Alnico V pickups and the classic trapezoid configuration of two volume and two tone control knobs. This lets you make fast tone and volume adjustments while holding a note. Its chrome hardware includes the famous Tune-o-matic bridge/Stopbar tailpiece combo for monstrous sustain and quality Grover tuning machines. Case not included.
