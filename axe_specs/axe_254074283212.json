This hardtail guitar has a beefy tone with the Seymour Duncan Invader Humbucker pickups. Guitar is in great shape, with a few bumps and scuffs (see photos) to be expected with a guitar that's nearly 20 years old. Case is in good working order, is very plush, and also has a few nicks, scuffs, and scratches. The Fender\u00a0Tom DeLonge\u00a0signature stratocaster\u00a0is a regular Stratocaster body with one humbucking pickup, one volume knob and a 1970s large Fender headstock. It has a white Seymour Duncan SH-8 Invader in the bridge position Its neck consists of solid maple with a rosewood fretboard. The neck features a large 1970s CBS headstock. The Custom Shop models made for Tom DeLonge himself had Sperzel locking tuners, but the regular production model (Made in Mexico) had stock Kluson-style tuners made by Ping. The pearloid pick-guard found on the Fender version truly sets the guitar apart. This Fender is the predecessor of the\u00a0Gibson Tom DeLonge Signature ES-333.
