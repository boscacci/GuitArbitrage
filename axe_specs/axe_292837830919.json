{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Near MINT. I am the original owner and have babied this guitar since I purchased it. This guitar has no dents, dings, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. There is zero \"buckle rash\". It has been RARELY played. This is a 2005 model. Everything works perfectly (tuners, controls, truss, etc.). Neck is straight, fret wear is near zero. Everything is original. The original hardcase and all accessories, and papers are included. There are other Angus Signature SGs out there, but they all have a ding, or scratch somewhere. This one does not. Please note...this guitar was purchased from a highly respected local shop in Louisville, CO. and NOT from a website. Also note, I will not ship to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico.", "ItemID": "292837830919", "EndTime": "2018-12-05T18:36:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-28T18:36:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Near-MINT-Gibson-Angus-Young-Signature-SG-Electric-Guitar-/292837830919", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Portland, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928378309198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/rXcAAOSwwTFb~t4w/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/4acAAOSwXAxb~t4G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/Eh8AAOSwZwlb~t4M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/C5AAAOSwEJ1b~t4Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/IckAAOSwe9Fb~t4d/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/yiwAAOSwE9pb~t4i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/l08AAOSwenJb~t4r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/SxAAAOSws0pb~t43/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/KuwAAOSwkvtb~t6Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/hx0AAOSwvqVb~t6e/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/IE8AAOSwVCpb~t6i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/EusAAOSwZwlb~t6m/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "97219", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blocke31", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 38, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 40}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Near MINT Gibson Angus Young Signature SG Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Limted Run"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 264, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Near MINT.
