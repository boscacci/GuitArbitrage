{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Used in very good to excellent condition. These Samick-made Korean Fenders are surprisingly great guitars, very reminiscent of 80s era MIJ Jackson/Charvels. I rewired the neck pickup so it is no longer out of phase with the bridge (the green and black wires are switched around), but it is easy enough to redo if desired. I also had to replace the 5 way as the blade on the original was very loose and floppy. As far as I know everything else is original. The Showmaster FMT, QMT and QBT HH guitars offer warm sustain and amazing playability thanks to their set-in, high-access, 24-fret necks, American-made Seymour Duncan pickups, five-way switching, and Smoked Chrome hardware \u2013 and a carved, highly-figured flame (FMT) or quilt (QMT) maple top, or quilt bubinga top (QBT). These instruments are stunningly beautiful, easy to play and loaded with superb tone!

Ask questions before bidding, I'm always happy to take more photos if there's anything specific you want to see. My photography skills really suck and my camera isn't much better, but I'll do what I can. This is a used guitar, and I am not a luthier. There may be issues with this instrument that I do not have the skill to identify or even be aware of. Each of my listings is described to the best of my ability, and if you have any questions that I did not address in the listing or photos, please ask before bidding. Thanks! All reasonable offers considered. I generally ship the next business day after receiving payment, but there will be exceptions. This is listed locally and in other places online, so this listing will be closed if it sells elsewhere. If you want to negotiate, I can remove pickups, tuners, electronics, w/e it takes to get it into your price range, just message me with your offer. Look carefully at all pics and ask questions before you bid.", "ItemID": "183583822172", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T00:40:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T14:50:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2004-Fender-Showmaster-Cherry-Sunburst-FMT-HH-Seymour-Duncan-/183583822172", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Xenia, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835838221728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K8MAAOSwyYRcEnEK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/tHkAAOSwfplcEnEM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/P4IAAOSwx9lcEm9~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/ssYAAOSwXyBcEm-B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/eikAAOSwysFcEm-D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/h74AAOSwwTFcEm-F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/eI0AAOSwp3dcEm-H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/h8sAAOSwv0dcEm-J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/JZYAAOSwqkRcEm-L/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/WcMAAOSwHglcEm-N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/zIcAAOSwjfdcEm-P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/bcAAAOSwmOBcEm-T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "45385", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chazmack", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 844, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1992}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2004 Fender Showmaster Cherry Sunburst FMT HH Seymour Duncan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["FENDER\u00ae"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["2004 Showmaster QMT"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["tobacco sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Country of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea"]}, {"Name": "Type", "Value": ["Electric"]}, {"Name": "Finish", "Value": ["Gloss"]}, {"Name": "Hand", "Value": ["Right Hand"]}, {"Name": "Model, Series", "Value": ["Showmaster Korea"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 100, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good condition with only minor play wear.
