{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a nice vintage Fender Squier II-- made in Korea, in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Has the sought after E9 serial number. Much better quality than more recent Squiers, like the Bullets and Affinities. Nice reinforced maple neck. Frets in very good shape. Truss rod works as it should. Good action as set up (though you can definitely adjust to suit your tastes). Electronics all work as they should. Guitar plays and sounds great. The tone block on the stock bridge has some cracking (see pictures). No big deal, though-- as these were not the best tone blocks and you would probably want to upgrade this with a better tremolo bridge anyway (they are not expensive). Otherwise, there are a few dings here and there, as you would expect from a 30-year old guitar (see pictures), though none of these blemishes are structural or affect playability. This guitar has a lot of mojo, and would make a nice restoration project, or provide a good starting point for a custom project. Let me know if you have any questions, and I will do my best to answer them.
