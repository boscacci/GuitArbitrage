{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1995 Gibson Les Paul Special with P-90's with desirable High Gloss Nitro TV Yellow. Guitar is all original, does have a few chips, some dings and some finish crazing from age. Majority of dings are only on the back of the body...see the 9th picture. Just the beginnings of a natural Relic and has character. Neck is straight, frets great, everything is functional and Guitar is very clean. It has a high gloss nitrocellulose finish over a mahogany body and neck, a bound rosewood fingerboard and inlaid mother of pearl Gibson headstock logo. The 90s were perhaps the last great decade for these models before Gibson started downgrading the finish and detail quality.I am the second owner, as I got this Classic Gibson years ago from the original adult Female Owner, who got it new as a teenager for Christmas. I have quite a few Guitars and have played it very little in the time I've owned it. I wanted to keep it in the same condition as I got it, so it has mainly been carefully stored in a closet with some of my other Guitars. It didn't come with a Gibson Hardshell Case when I got it, but will include a Stone Brand Soft Case that offers the protection of the same plush-lined, rigid foam insert found in Hardshell Guitar Cases. It has a rugged, weather-resistant nylon Gig Bag style exterior with zippered closers. This is a Great Player P-90 Gibson Special and a collectable model that will surely go up in value with time. Just time to start thinning down my collection. Note: One the same year was recently listed here on eBay for $2000 obo. It sold for an unknown offer. Not sure exactly what I'd accept for mine, so if you're a serious Buyer, don't be timid on making be an offer. I just may take it and remember...shipping is free. Thank you. I haven't sold on eBay for a long time, but if you check my 'Seller\" Feedback and go way back to the late 90's, you'll find I have plenty of Guitar & Gear selling experience and Positive Feedback. No returns, so please ask questions before bidding. FREE INSURED GROUND SHIPPING.
