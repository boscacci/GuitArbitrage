{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Gibson L-48 that is in playable condition up to the 9th fret. Looks to be circa 50's era. I had a new bone nut fitted and installed and some other servicing done to this guitar in August at Canada's top pro guitar shop - see the invoice. Most likely it would need a neck reset to make it playable all the way up the neck. A back brace is loose. The guitar has a good warm tone with good projection and does not make rattling noises despite to loose back brace. May be other issues I am not aware of. The case looks original and has had its cover material removed. Nice sturdy wood case. Good project or play as is. Being sold AS IS: No returns on this guitar. Shipping to USA or Canada is $50. $350 to Europe. On 08-Dec-18 at 09:09:16 EST, seller added the following information: USA bidders: please note that there are no duties payable for this guitar because it was made in the USA.", "ItemID": "264077678884", "EndTime": "2018-12-14T16:13:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T16:13:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Gibson-L-48-archtop-guitar-w-original-case-Warm-full-tone-made-USA-/264077678884", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "York, Ontario", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640776788848080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/RKgAAOSwb8BcCpiJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/3MoAAOSw5-hcCphk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DM0AAOSwiwZcCphn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/KdYAAOSwUm5cCphq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/YfEAAOSwI9FcCphu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/9D0AAOSwIddcCphx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/umwAAOSwIbtcCph0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ulQAAOSwgGZcCph3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/8KQAAOSwMI1cCph6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/JoYAAOSwk4RcCph-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/IuUAAOSw19dcCpjS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/PGcAAOSwlThcCpiF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "M6S 2R4", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cooltintoys", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1855, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 29, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 708.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 940.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1298}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US", "FR", "GB", "DE"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Gibson L-48 archtop guitar w original case.
