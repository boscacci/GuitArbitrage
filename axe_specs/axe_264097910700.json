Your satisfaction is very important . Please contact me first before you decide to open a case with Ebay/Paypal or leave a neutral/negative feedback. I have a 100% customer satisfaction rate with handling any issues and will work to assure your satisfaction in a beneficial way to both parties,,, shipping rates are calculated by ebay by weight to your zipcode from where i ship from,.... NOTE the calculated shipping is not always exact and there have been issues with different amounts showing on auction, and then more or less on a final Invoice.let me know if you see a difference or if you think your paying too much,, i will send you a screen shot of the postage paid page and refund any difference,,,if its more i will not ask for the difference..you will only pay exact or lower....i use recycled packing material when i can, styrofoam , bubble wrap ect, as well as boxes and my hope this will get used again and again...... I mostly use fedex ground or fedex smart post depending on size of package and weight you may pay for fedex smart but receive ground , ground is usually faster , depending where you are,... smart post is slower but less cost, if your package will ship priority mail for close to the same cost, i usually choose so,if you overpaid shipping, i will refund the difference, if you need it faster ask me about priority shipping rates,.....you will receive track#s and shipping info when i print labels, i ship within 24 hr. i do not charge extra for packing or handling fees, calulated by weight to your zipcode from 21520 or 70584 (im usually in one of these two places) if you care to compare...see my feedback and good luck bidding!!
