{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The Mercury IV is a dynamic tone enhancer, created to bring out additional harmonic character from instruments and amplifiers. The pedal features a unique, discrete analog circuit, with a meticulously selected vintage germanium transistor at its heart. The Boost control of the Mercury IV offers a staggering 35 dB of gain, with nine (9) tone-shaping options via two toggle switches, to gently or aggressively boost tube amplifiers. The real magic however, resides in the Harmonics control; bringing more dimension and life to ones\u2019 tone. Subtle sparkle, complex textures, and octave-like overtones can all be found here. With a sound and response like hot tubes on the edge of breakup, these even-order harmonics are independently generated, giving you full control over the mix. The Mercury IV is completely hand-soldered and handmade in Portland Oregon to the highest degree of quality possible. These are truly artisan-crafted tone devices, sparing no detail within or without. The Mercury IV utilizes true-bypass switching via the heaviest duty mechanical footswitch available, while your tone is transferred via quality open-frame Switchcraft jacks. Open one up and you\u2019ll see an unparalleled display of craftsmanship; with immaculate hand-soldered PCB, detailed military-spec wiring, and custom Spaceman heavy-duty battery connector. On top of the cast aluminum enclosure sits a durable, engraved vinyl faceplate and jewel indicator light. This pedal is truly built to last a lifetime. Each pedal number is hand-hammered on the nameplate, stating its limited availability and each is also signed and numbered on the inside.", "ItemID": "173675530212", "EndTime": "2018-12-09T20:16:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-04T20:16:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Spceman-Mercury-IV-Germanium-Harmonic-Boost-/173675530212", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Great Neck, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736755302128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uWEAAOSwJ~xcBuAh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WrQAAOSwnh5cBuAl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/T1gAAOSwIKNcBuAo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bLwAAOSwUP5cBuAs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RSAAAOSw0TBcBuAw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xjAAAOSwGPNcBuA0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ON0AAOSw8kVcBuA4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MwcAAOSwH2VcBuA9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DewAAOSw5YlcBuBB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11021", "PrimaryCategoryID": "41416", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Parts & Accessories:Effects Pedals:Distortion & Overdrive", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ai20552139", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 336, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 273}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Spceman Mercury IV Germanium Harmonic Boost", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["spaceman"]}]}, "HitCount": 28, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:180009:181222:41416", "SecondaryCategoryID": "33034", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 280.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint unused new in box bought by mistake", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
