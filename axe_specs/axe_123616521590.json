{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Greetings, What a find.. Custom Shop Korina Explorer Prototype - what is there else to be said?! The guitar does not have a serial and it is stamped Gibson Prototype and 'second' along with the Custom Shop logo. The ones among us that know korina know how difficult it is to spray it in black (no need to go in further details) and hence the 'second' stamp! The guitar is solid and the pots were the only thing modified! The guitar had also a neck reset done. It is almost impossible to tell and it was a clean separation. Hyde glue was used to reattach the neck to the body and the guitar is absolutely perfect and resonates like crazy. I doubt you will find another explorer that has such clarity and that cuts through the mix such as this one! The original frets have minimal fret wear, the guitar shows weather checking, dings, dents that only make it appear as an old one from the 50s. The Tim Shaws are awesome and the hardware is all original! The pots were replaced based on my preference (I might have the original ones somewhere and will include them once found, if not will ship them later free of charge!). The original hard shell case is in excellent condition with minimal wear considering its age! Feel free to ask any questions you might have!
