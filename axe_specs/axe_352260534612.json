Cond. Click images to enlarge Description Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! shipping to the lower 48 states.I will not ship anywhere else,Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool \"Custom Shack Gio \". I'm not sure of the exact model,Ibanez has so many models it is hard to keep up.I believe it is a GRG121EX. The 24 fret bound maple/rosewood neck neck has zero fret wear . Guitar features all black hardware. The Body looks very nice, just mild surface scratches. The pickups are hot HMV Black/White Zebra Pole 4 wire humbuckers,8k-neck, 15k-bridge. I also put in a push/pull tone control so that the humbuckers can be split into a single coils. When used with the three way toggle switch you get six different pickup combinations. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound killer on this guitar. Much hotter than the stock pickups. The capacitor has been upgraded with a Orange Drop Style .022uf capacitor,more range of tone control and a smoother response. Guitar looks,plays, and sounds great Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
