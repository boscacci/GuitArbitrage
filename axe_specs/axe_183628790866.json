{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1985 MIJ Ibanez X Series XV500! Amaxing pink/purple metallic halfburst finish. Overall in amazing shape for a guitar that's over 30 years old! Pro Rock'r bridge is original, as are the Ibanez Smooth Tune II tuners and V/boomerang strap buttons- very clean! The only missing parts are two of the bridge lock screws have been replaced with chrome ones (they still function fine) and there is NO WHAMMY BAR. Pickups are the original Ibanez V5 rails; very clean! Body is basswood. There are some chips and light scratches, particularly on the points. The only major issue is that the lower horn by the neck had a piece break off. IT HAS BEEN REPAIRED and was very well done; I have had this guitar over 15 years and no issues with it. Headstock has some chips but overall nice. Neck is straight, truss rod works and set up for good, low action. Frets have some wear but plenty of life left (fretboard was recently oiled). Minimal belt rash on the back. Neck plate has the finish worn off in a few places. Serial is K855039. Beautiful axe, ready to shred! 22 frets, rosewood on maple. Includes the original fitted hardshell case.
