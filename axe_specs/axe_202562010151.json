{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a gorgeous 2016 Gretsch G6122T-62GE (Golden Era) Hollowbody Electric. I am the original owner. This guitar is flawless.

The quality on this guitar is amazing.\u00b7 Arched maple body provides your tone with excellent definition\u00b7 Sweet vintage tone from TV Jones Classic pickups\u00b7 Three volume controls + one tone switch = exceptional sonic flexibility\u00b7 Bigsby tailpiece yields smooth vibrato actionArched maple body provides your tone with excellent definition. Maple has to be one of the most lively, bright, and colorful tonewoods out there, which is exactly why Gretsch decided to make their G6122T-62GE Vintage Select 1962 Chet Atkins Country Gentleman almost entirely out of this wonderful wood. This hollowbody's arched body yields a wonderfully snappy, open tone that, when combined with the dynamic sound of its TV Jones Classic pickups, cuts through a dense mix and sounds great in any situation. TV Jones Classic pickups deliver timeless Gretsch tone. When you want that classic '50s-era Gretsch tone, you need real TV Jones humbuckers. That's why Gretsch gave their G6122T-62GE Vintage Select 1962 Chet Atkins Country Gentleman a pair of TV Classic pickups. Designed to sound just like the humbuckers found in '50s and '60s Gretsch guitars, these pickups give your guitar a bright and open sound that's jangly on your highs with the kind of bite you'd normally associate with single-coil pickups. It's the perfect sound for rock, rockabilly, blues, country, and more.Three volume controls + one tone switch = exceptional sonic flexibility.It's easy to stereotype the Gretsch G6122T-62GE Vintage Select 1962 Chet Atkins Country Gentleman until you play it, and then you realize you can pull off a lot of tonal tricks with it. With a volume control for each pickup, you can create your perfect balance between warmth, bite, and brilliance when both pickups are engaged. The 3-way tone selector switch lets you fine-tune your sound once you have the pickups dialed in. And thanks to the master volume control, you can take your tube amp from clean to growling without changing the balance between your pickups. Of course, you'll get sweet tone from the neck and bridge pickups individually, but there's a lot of territory to cover when you combine them.Nothing beats the character and vintage vibe that a real Bigsby-style tailpiece adds to the Gretsch G6122T-62GE Vintage Select 1962 Chet Atkins Country Gentleman. Based on the original design created by Paul A. Bigsby, this Bigsby Licensed tailpiece requires next to no effort to use, making it particularly easy to pull off slow, subtle, and extended bends.Gretsch G6122T-62GE Hollowbody Electric Guitar Features:\u00b7 Hollowbody electric guitar with period-correct specs\u00b7 Arched maple body delivers a deliciously snappy, open tone\u00b7 TV Jones Classic pickups yield sweet, vintage character\u00b7 Highly playable standard U-shaped maple neck with ebony fingerboard\u00b7 3 volume controls and a 3-way tone selector switch create exceptional sonic flexibility\u00b7 Bigsby tailpiece provides smooth vibrato action.\u2003 Paper in Oil Capacitors as made in the 50's for awesome toneTech Specs\u00b7 Body Type: Hollowbody\u00b7 Body Shape: Doublecut\u00b7 Left-/Right-handed: Right-handed\u00b7 Number of Strings: 6\u00b7 Body Material: Maple\u00b7 Top Material: Maple\u00b7 Color: Walnut Stain\u00b7 Neck Material: Maple\u00b7 Neck Shape: U shape profile\u00b7 Fingerboard Material: Ebony\u00b7 Fingerboard Inlay: Offset Neo-Classic Thumbnail inlays\u00b7 Number of Frets: 22, vintage style\u00b7 Scale Length: 25.5\"\u00b7 Nut Width: 1.6875\"\u00b7 Nut Material: Zero fret\u00b7 Bridge/Tailpiece: Ebony based rocking bar with Bigsby B6GVT\u00b7 Tuners: Grover Imperial tuners\u00b7 Neck & Bridge Pickups: TV Jones Filter'Tron humbucker with gold covers\u00b7 Controls: 2 x pickup volumes, 1 x master volume, 3-way pickup toggle switch, 3-way tone selector switch, standby switch.NO offers for trades.
