{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling my 2014 Gibson '61 Original 2 re-issue SG. Factory Maestro tailpiece in rare 'Dark Mahogany'. Don't see many of these...the Cherry color is much more common. Nice dark Rosewood board too, all the chrome and hardware just pop. Pro setup, plays great. I dropped a Bare Knuckle Mule in the bridge, solid PAF kick ass tones. I left the stock Gibson '57 pickup in the neck position, nice classic cleans. I'm including the '57 bridge pickup in the sale... Gibson hard case. Elliot Easton has this Maestro tailpiece on his signature SG. It does add that something special as Elliot explains...The Vibrola does, however, give the Easton SG a voice that is way different than a standard stop tailpiece. Acoustically, the Easton sounds open and floral--it's not as grounded or as focused as my SG Standard. Through a 50-watt plexi Marshall or a Fender Deluxe Reverb, the Easton gives off the old-school Clapton/Cream stank big time, as it produces overtones that a fixed-bridge SG simply can't deliver. Killer looking SG that plays and sounds as good as it looks. Shipping to USA is $50.00 FedEx insured.", "ItemID": "173660740632", "EndTime": "2018-12-23T17:44:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-26T09:54:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-SG-61-RI-Maestro-Bare-Knuckle-/173660740632", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736607406328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk3/z/HvgAAOSwNJpbhRMK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODE=/z/jjMAAOSwFWdbhRMj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/BMUAAOSwSZBbhRM1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDgx/z/6mcAAOSwjkxbhRNI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y5EAAOSwWeJbhRNY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzMFgxNjAw/z/81EAAOSwnRJbhRNm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uxgAAOSwHn9bhRN4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "96815", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dabutnut", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 784, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 644}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson SG '61 RI with Maestro/Bare Knuckle", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Dark Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1961"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Factory Maestro/Bare Knuckle bridge pickup"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG '61 Reissue"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["SG61CWCH3"]}]}, "HitCount": 397, "Subtitle": "Rare dark Mahogany", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78608041", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar is in very nice condition, plays and sounds great like an SG should!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
