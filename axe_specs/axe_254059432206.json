The painting is very garish and unique. There are rumors about painting as lacquer. But ESP does not disclose the kind of paint, so I do not know the correct answer. Anyway, I saw this type of paint processing for the first time. Color is dark dark dark cherry. The surface of the EMG 81's cover is smooth. This EMG 81 has the possibility of the artist model, not the usual EMG 81. About the machine heads, I searched in internet. But I could not find the same the machine head. This machine head was very convenient, I was very impressed. I have a lock type Sperzel, but this machine head is not inferior to that. I set a new string, so you do not have to change strings for the long time. When the time to exchange strings comes, please look forward to it. This machine head is excellent. It automatically cuts extra strings. You may know this machine head, but I did not know. So, for me it was a surprise. Making is very polite. I feel policy of ESP. And you can feel a made in Japan.
