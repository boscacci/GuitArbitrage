{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a an Ibanez RG2EX1 rocker with loads of sustain and ringing harmonics. This one has been played, light scratching through-out, some fret wear and dings, but still presents well, still plays well and sounds awesome. Features a basswood body, maple neck, and rosewood fretboard. String through hardtail design and intonation well adjusted and EMG designed Ibanez passive pickups reading about 7.75 on the ohmmeter, this one is a powerful sounding piece. There is plenty of meat left on the jumbo frets for future filing or dressing if desired for perfect low action. The guitar plays well as is with fairly low action on the \u201cWizard III\u201d neck. I have touched up two dings with black glossy nail polish, shown in pictures. I have oiled the fretboard, tuners are working smooth and firm, electronics are working as they should, pickup height is adjusted and well balanced between the two, screws tightened and truss rod tweaked. Guitar is a solid feeling 7 1/2 pounds. Check out my pictures carefully and ask questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed to help you feel confident in your purchase. Check out our eBay rating and feedback. I list the guitar stuff, and try hard to describe accurately. I will promptly ship carefully and insured. Sale is intended to be final.......... thanks for looking", "ItemID": "183665402623", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T01:48:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-02T01:11:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/IBANEZ-RG2EX1-/183665402623", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bettendorf, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836654026238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jawAAOSwPA1cR4Az/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0uoAAOSwpzRcR4A0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y34AAOSw1IhcR4A5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d~AAAOSw8U9cR4BA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mkEAAOSwbZ5cR4BF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y6AAAOSwa3lcR4BL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4zoAAOSwv0dcR4BS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xssAAOSw4b1cR4BY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eVsAAOSwpFtcR4Bg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/feYAAOSwH4dcR4Bn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F2cAAOSwLDlcR4Bw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lsQAAOSwMhVcR4Bx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mychildren5-2008", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2014, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 144.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 144.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 422}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "IBANEZ RG2EX1", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ibanez RG"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black/White Binding"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RG2EX1"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}]}, "HitCount": 52, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=847815792", "StoreName": "Bargain Charlie&#39;s"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Dings, still looks good, sounds great", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
