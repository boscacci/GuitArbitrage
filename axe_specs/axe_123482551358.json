{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction is a 1961 Guild CE-100 DP. I purchased this guitar in 1997 and it hasn't seen a lot of use recently. I figured it was time for someone who was going to play it to own it. It's in very good shape with no cracks or other structural problems. It's got a few cosmetic blemishes, the biggest is that \"George Cool\" is scratched on the back of the head stock. I've tried to take pictures of all the blemishes. As far as I know everything on the guitar is original. The hard shell case was purchased new when I got the guitar. As shown in the pictures the serial number is 15467, and it was built in Hoboken, New Jersey. Please contact me if you have further questions about it. I found the following description on the internet: This lightweight 16 3/8-inch-wide guitar weighs just 6.00 lbs. and has a body thickness of 2 3/4 inches, a nice fat nut width of just over 1 11/16 inches and a scale length of 24 3/4 inches. Laminated maple body, one-piece mahogany neck, and rosewood fretboard with 20 frets and inlaid pearl block position markers. The top of the guitar has triple binding (white/black/white) and the neck has single white binding. Headstock with inlaid pearl \"Guild\" logo and pearl \"Chesterfield\" inlay. Serial number (\"15321\") impressed into the back of the headstock Individual Grover Sta-Tite open-back tuners with petal-shaped metal buttons. Two single-coil P-90-style pickups with white plastic covers and balanced outputs of 5.15k and 5.01k. Transparent acrylic (or Lucite) rounded pickguard painted black from the back after a gold silk-screened \"Chevron\" and \"Guild\" logo have been applied. Four controls (two volume, two tone) on lower treble bout plus three-way selector switch on upper bass bout. Guild transparent plastic knobs with G-logo on a silver disc. Rosewood bridge with pre-set compensating saddle and Guild \"harp\" tailpiece with cut-out \"G.\" Apart from some very minor age checking, this guitar is in exceptionally fine (9.00) and totally original condition. Housed in the original Guild brown hardshell case with burgundy plush lining (9.00). \"The CE-100 was of the same laminated construction as the other deep-bodied models in the line, but it was the first model to have a florentine (sharp) cutaway, which was described in the '56 catalog with the words: 'Old World' cutaway design enables player to reach highest positions with ease\" (Hans Moust, The Guild Guitar Book, p. 59). In 1959 the CE-100D was listed with two pickups \"(on some labels the model designation would be CE-100DP).\"", "ItemID": "123482551358", "EndTime": "2018-11-18T00:06:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T01:02:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Guild-CE-100-DP-Arch-top-hollow-body-guitar-hard-shell-case-/123482551358", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234825513588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OO0AAOSwzHFb53vq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UHkAAOSwVYtb53vw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/60EAAOSwFx5b53v2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CjIAAOSwoVZb53v7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kHIAAOSwZFxb53wU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Qp4AAOSw0QBb53wZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8CYAAOSwAE9b53wc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lSoAAOSwi7Vb53we/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X2gAAOSw86Nb53wi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ipQAAOSwkvtb53wl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/es8AAOSwpw5b53wn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nBEAAOSw3T5b53wr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "49546", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "riodige71", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "z***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 409}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Guild CE-100 DP Arch top hollow body guitar with hard shell case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Guild"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 212, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 760.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
