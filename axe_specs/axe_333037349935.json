{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fair condition. The guitar does have some wear and damage from age and previous owners. The paint has some discoloration and cracks. The neck has some dents and scratches but doesn't appear to be warped. I tuned it up and even with the old stings it carries a good tone and doesn't seem to be warped, but the neck and intonation more then likely need some adjustments. As far as the electronics go they do work but i keep having to play with the jack in order for it to work but it does play.
