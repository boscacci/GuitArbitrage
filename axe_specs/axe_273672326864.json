{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS Serial Number # DZ8014174 2009- 2010 , Olympic Pearl , Rosewood Fretboard , Brown Shell Pickguard . Fender Hardshell TSA approved Case . Nice Condition , a hard to see ding and slight use , kept in non smoking house environment. This guitar plays like butter and has a beautiful look to it . Bought new at guitar center Pasadena late 2010 but the serial # seems a year earlier, no passing lane. You can see questions and view replies and photos by clicking >contact seller>QnA Here's a few on this item::: *does this have the 10\"-14\" compound radius fretboard? That would be no . I was a little confused myself cause it was purchased in late 2010 but it's a 2009 with 9.5 radius fretboard (SCN) samarium cobalt noiseless pickups and S-1 switching button inside the volume knob . I checked it with a set of radius gauges. *Could you send a picture close up to the nick on the guitar and any big signs of wear? Thanks Here's some shots of the wear that I can see . The 4th pic is the only thing that really can be seen and there are pick marks on the pick guard . I just put a new set of 9's strings on and the fretboard is looking sharp and clean . You can see the frets have been played a bit as seen in the posting photos *Very subjective, but how does it sound? Two parts to this: can you get that country twang sound out of those pickups? And, second, do all the electronics seem to work. Any sound issues in general? Thanks. Very subjective answer , I think some of the pickup configurations sound great. I'm able to get that country twang , lots of good blues tone and serious spank out of the humbucker on clean setting on a mesa-boogie mk.III. With distortion the tone fun increases. I believe that the sound, punch, tone, etc. are very pickup height sensitive. Season to taste. The electronics work flawlessly no click or scratch . Some are confused about the S-1 switching , including me since the American deluxe (to the elite) models have changed with versions .This is what I found on this one.. http://www.fuzzfaced.net/american-deluxe-strat-hss-second.html This S-1 demo video is from the same era year guitar. Also a good sample of the tones available. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH3GqqUm74Y", "ItemID": "273672326864", "EndTime": "2019-01-27T13:07:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-25T15:52:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-American-Deluxe-Stratocaster-HSS-/273672326864", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Whitefish, Montana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736723268648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gQcAAOSwhu9cI38a/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WxEAAOSwO7dcI381/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fQMAAOSwuZVcI3-4/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kgYAAOSwF1tcI3~u/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CDEAAOSwRWZcI4A~/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NncAAOSwD1pcI4Bs/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rdUAAOSwWH1cI4Ds/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rmMAAOSwEp5cI4EB/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/URoAAOSwvGZcI4Ek/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gpUAAOSwAFFcI4G3/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eEMAAOSwZNtcI4IA/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PyMAAOSwWAhcI4JA/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "59937", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wildfishead", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 220, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 902.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 902.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 651}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["American Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster HSS"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 76, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
