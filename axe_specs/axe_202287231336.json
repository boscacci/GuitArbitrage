These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying. We ship international items primarily by USPS. If item is too large, for that country\u2019s size restrictions, it will not ship. As stated above, please get a shipping quote to find out if item can be shipped to your location. On international sales a tracking number will always be posted. Often times, once the package clears customs, the tracking number is no longer useful and there is no way of determining the location or delivery status of the package. Because of this, international sales are final upon shipping of the items. We will not change items type or sales amounts on customs forms. Please take this under advisement before bidding.
