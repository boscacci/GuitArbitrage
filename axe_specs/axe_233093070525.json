{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Looks as though this maybe a MIJ fujigen make from my research so far. Mateo was the brand name given to guitars built by Fujigen and brought in by the distributor back in the '70s for Music West.( Electra). Somewhat likely to be affiliated with Hoshino(Fujigen)It's this intricate relationship between distributor (Hoshino), brand (Ibanez) and factory (Fujigen). Fujigen is known to have produced guitars with these brands during the 1970s:Greco/Ibanez/Antoria/Electa/Crestwood/Carlo Robelli/Yamaha/Epiphone Mateo. They also built some with the name brand 'Mateo' it's probably Matsumoku, because of their different size neck plate etc.... Researching the tie between these two leaves a lot to the imagination. But, what can be said is the 1st Electas (1970) were made at the Fujigen Factory, Japan (along w/ Ibanez) and were distributed in Austrailia. The later Electas (2000's) were made in China and distributed by Lamberti Bros in Melbourne. The Teisco Tie- up to the 1966 Teisco catalog, the Fender copies were not shown. Also note, what we call the 70's Fender Headstock was actually kicked off in Dec 1965 and ran for the next 15 yrs, thus the 70's namesake. In 1967, Teisco was sold to Kawai who discontinued the Teisco name in 1969. What we do know is that these guitars have a lot of the same parts, common to the era. We can narrow the manufacturing date to some time between 1967 - 1970. The Teisco '67 - '69 and the Electa '70. What we don't know - did Kawai use the Fujigen factory to make the last of the Teiscos in what was the beginning of the Lawsuit \"copy\" Era? Perhaps, but if not, they did use the same parts supplier.
