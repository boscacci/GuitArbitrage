{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1980\u2019s Fender Stratocaster ST57-55 \u201cE\u201d Serial - Made in Japan. Photos are part of description. Overall Excellent condition with a few minor superficial paint blemishes as can be expected from a 30 plus year old guitar. Original registration certificate matching serial number, Original Owners manual, Wammy Bar, and Original soft case. I am far from an expert or claim to be for that matter, I\u2019ve just had a fetish for collecting guitars over the years; This guitar seems to have all the original parts as per factory release and seems to have had a very easy and sparingly used life. Standard yellowing of knobs and plates is is the normal case for these old Strat\u2019s. Everything is working at the time of listing. Impressive sound and more than holds its own against any 1970\u2019s Fender USA. All precautions are taken in packing and TRACK & TRACE IS DEFINITELY included in shipping charges for all buyers. For international or Australian interstate buyers I will have to buy a Generic hardcase for safe shipping and thus the higher shipping charges.", "ItemID": "283320310438", "EndTime": "2019-01-26T02:37:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-29T07:30:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-Made-japan-E-Serial-/283320310438", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Kingsgrove, NSW", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833203104388080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F-wAAOSw64xcJx6S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6ScAAOSwohVcJx6K/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TJEAAOSwUm5cJx6V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n94AAOSwoylcJx6M/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/quQAAOSw-HRcJx6W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vt0AAOSwWk5cJx6c/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JegAAOSwrpJcJx6Q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NyoAAOSw2fRcJx6O/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NVUAAOSwu3ZcJx6Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SXIAAOSw0d1cJx6T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/7V0AAOSwuvFcJx6G/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk4/z/fjcAAOSwzwVcJx6I/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "2208", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rare_indulgences", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 175, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1002.59, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1399.0, "CurrencyID": "AUD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "z***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 309}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Australia", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster Made In japan \u201cE\u201d Serial", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}]}, "HitCount": 528, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "AU", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
