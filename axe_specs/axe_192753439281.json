{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Beautiful 1982 Ibanez MC 120 DS for sale . Those who know vintage guitars know that from the mid 70's thru the mid 80's Ibanez made some of the highest quality guitars available. This guitar is no exception and just oozes of craftsmanship. The finish on this guitar is \"DS\" which means \"dark stain\". It is difficult to see in photos, but it is a translucent finish so you can see the grain of the wood. Guitar is in very good condition, with a few small dings that don't show up in the photos, but considering its age I consider this very minor. The hard to find original case is in excellent condition as well. Guitar plays very well with low action, straight neck, and no distinguishable fret wear. The humbucking pickups split for a multitude of tones. I have it priced to sell, far less than I paid for it several years ago. I don't really want to part with it, but I've got to raise some cash. Putting this ad together, I don't see an option for free shipping, but it's free. Also, I only take PayPal, so I'm not sure why the ad has credit card payments listed (maybe that's an Ebay thing...been a while since I've listed something here). Thank you for looking, I hope this goes to a good home. :)", "ItemID": "192753439281", "EndTime": "2018-12-23T23:15:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-09T23:45:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1982-Ibanez-MC120-DS-w-OHSC-Free-Shipping-/192753439281", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Noblesville, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927534392818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyOFg3NDc=/z/RBEAAOSwWrxcDYdX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyOFg3NDc=/z/TlwAAOSw-iZcDYqu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyOFg3NDc=/z/SC4AAOSwI9FcDYq1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyOFg3NDc=/z/FOsAAOSwV3dcDYrF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ3WDEzMjg=/z/hRAAAOSwy2pcDYrK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyOFg3NDc=/z/gGcAAOSwkXFcDYrS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyOFg3NDc=/z/crAAAOSwXAxcDYrV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyOFg3NDc=/z/bAAAAOSwrQ5cDYrd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ3WDEzMjg=/z/hd4AAOSwNphcDYrj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "46062", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "260comanchepilot", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 69, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 697}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1982 Ibanez MC120 DS w/ OHSC Free Shipping", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}]}, "HitCount": 189, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
