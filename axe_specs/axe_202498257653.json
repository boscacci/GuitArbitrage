{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a Limited Edition, 2015 Epiphone G-1275 Double Neck Electric Guitar. I bought both the guitar and Epiphone hard-shell case brand new in 2015 and had the guitar professionally set up by Mark Touchet at Guitar Center in Baton Rouge, LA. This guitar is in very good condition. There are some minor blemishes which I've done my best to highlight in the photos, which are: (i) some light pickguard scratches, (ii) two white-ish spots on the devil horns (which I assume came from the guitar sitting in its case for so long), (iii) one white spot on the front of the headstock of the 12 sting neck, (iv) a small paint blemish where the inside of your right wrist would rest on the guitar,(v) some light oxidation on the two chrome pickups on the 12 string section,(vi) some light belt buckle scratches (on the back of the guitar), and (vii) some light wear from the guitar strap (on the back of the guitar). All of these blemishes are minor and difficult to notice, unless you are really looking for them. I have not removed the plastic that is covering the backplate. This guitar has mainly either been either sitting in my guitar case or hanging on my two wall hangers. I've only gigged it once, and mainly just strummed around on it when I took study breaks while I was in law school. It sounds amazing and all of the hardware and electronics (including tuning the tuning knobs, volume knobs, pickups, and pickup selector) are functioning perfectly. The action is low, and there is very minimal fret wear. The Epiphone case is also in very good condition. Please feel free to message me about any questions or concerns you may have regarding the guitar. Thanks!
