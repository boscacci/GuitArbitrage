Around 2000, Fernandes moved manufacturing base to China. ( excepting the specific model. ) This JOE PERRY model is made in Japan. It was manufactured in late 1980s ~ early 1990s. It is last JOE PERRY model by made in Japan. I can assert that it is a rare model. Aerosmith is very popular in japan. Because it is not currently produced in Japan, it is getting harder to find the Japanese-made LG75JP in the japanese used guitars market. I checked my sales history. Last time I sold a LG75JP in March 2018. On average it sells 2 from 3 in one year. Therefore, the LG 75JP is probably the last sale in 2018 from me. Mounted VH-1 Pickups in Neck and Bridge.
