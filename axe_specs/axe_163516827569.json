{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Univox Hi Flyer, Flier Mid 70\u2019s Guitar is Right and beautifuly aged. Plays Great. Condition is Used. This guitar is sweet. It has some wear, not surprising that it is 40+ years old. On the inside of the bottom bout appears to have a hole/chip. The hole is very small not large enough for a strap button? The rest of the guitar is right. Reliced the old fashion way. Vintage cream button tuners. These Univox pickups are the holy grail for this line. They\u2019re not white plastic like the 75-78 vintage. They\u2019re almost translucent, you can see the windings. They sound amazing and come with semi matching rolling saddles on the bridge. The trem is smooth and in good condition. These Japan Made Guitars have a Nice flat neck profile and this one plays fantastic.. No case Sorry. I\u2019ll ship with the neck un-attached for safety. Sounds great. This is a vintage guitar and is not perfect but it plays and sounds very nice. This is a Pay Pal auction only. No International, Hawaii and Alaska bidders please. $50 for shipping. Thanks and good luck!!", "ItemID": "163516827569", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T19:54:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T00:37:54.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Univox-Hi-Flyer-Flier-Mid-70-s-Guitar-Right-and-beautifuly-aged-Plays-Great-/163516827569", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Jaffrey, New Hampshire", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635168275698080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTE=/z/LWoAAOSwXI1cUj89/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sAAAAOSwPNhcUj9B/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HIMAAOSwYPNcUj8~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s04AAOSwtutcUj9A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dWAAAOSwwDJcUj8-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7ckAAOSwLKhcUj8-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ji0AAOSwltxcUj8-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTg2/z/kDUAAOSwxqpcUj9A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/k4MAAOSw2fRcUj9C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NjE=/z/3o8AAOSwUjVcUj9B/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "03452", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gharp11", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 749, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 289}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Univox Hi Flyer, Flier Mid 70\u2019s Guitar is Right and beautifuly aged.
