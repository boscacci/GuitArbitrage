Very few dings or finish loss. Neck is chunky and arrow straight. Frets are perfect. Original case functions 100%. Chrome is not pitted and in EX+ condition. Includes original vibrato bar and original cover for bridge. Really spectacular for a 50 + year old guitar. Aside from the re-fret this instrument is 100% original. This guitar is available for inspection, near Chicago. This guitar can be picked up in person (preferred). Buyer responsible for shipping charges, packed professionally at no charge. Will ship promptly upon receipt of payment. This guitar is as good as these get for this price, absolutely.
