{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is an American-Made Gibson Explorer with the Gibson Hardshell Case! According to serial number 011660516, this guitar was built in Nashville Tennessee on April 26th, 2006. The guitar and hardware are original EXCEPT for the pickups, which were UPGRADED to Seymour Duncans. This guitar plays ans sounds AMAZING (to HEAR THIS GUITAR BEING PLAYED + all functions tested, see the VIDEO referenced below). Structurally, this guitar is in good shape - no cracks or damage, the neck is nice and straight, the intonation is perfect, the Grover tuning machines hold tune wonderfully, the frets are in good shape, all of the electronics work perfectly (as you'll see / hear in the VIDEO referenced below) and the guitar was JUST SET UP with brand new strings. Cosmetically, it's in fair condition. Gloss black is hard to take pictures of, so see the VIDEO referenced below for close-ups of this guitar from EVERY ANGLE! As you'll see in the pictures and video, this guitar looks excellent from a distance and will be impressive on stage. Up close, it has your usual 12-year-old scratches and dings here and there and some belt marks on the back. Considering its age, it's in good condition though. The Gibson hardshell case that comes with this guitar is molded to the exact shape of the Explorer. The case structurally is in good shape, and it latches closed / protects the guitar perfectly. The locking center latch is missing though and the handle broke off years ago, so an interesting homemade handle was added (see pictures). Looks odd, but it works great. VIDEO: Sadly eBay doesn't allow video links, so to see the video of this guitar being tested, played, and shown from every angle, search Explorer12345 on YouTube and it will come right up!! This is a guitar that sounds and plays like a dream, and it's already 12 years old, so it's only going to INCREASE IN VALUE! If you're looking for a great instrument for on stage or in the studio, THIS is the guitar for you! Gibson still sells this exact model, and new the MSRP is $2,399.00, but I'm selling it at NO RESERVE so BID NOW for a great deal!!", "ItemID": "163343454664", "EndTime": "2018-11-05T21:37:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T21:37:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-Gibson-Explorer-USA-w-Hardshell-Case-Upgraded-Pickups-VIDEO-NR-/163343454664", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Union, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633434546648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY0WDE0NTI=/z/TE0AAOSwwj5b13jW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkyWDE0MjA=/z/tjAAAOSw0i5b13jZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE2WDEwNDI=/z/D0gAAOSw1tJb13jb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFg4NDQ=/z/J~QAAOSwWXFb13je/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTY4WDE1MDA=/z/TOsAAOSwJTtb13jg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIyWDEyMzA=/z/b2oAAOSwZrJb13ji/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTk2WDE0MjY=/z/O6AAAOSwYP5b13jl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzg4WDE0MDY=/z/0UkAAOSwqiJb13jm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQ0WDE1MDA=/z/0U4AAOSwqiJb13jr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE0WDE0MzY=/z/OZMAAOSw7Spb13jt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MjcyWDE1MDA=/z/YqUAAOSwF1tb13jv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "07083", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "violetroses28", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 285, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 18, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 454}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2006 Gibson Explorer (USA) w/ Hardshell Case + Upgraded Pickups (+ VIDEO) - NR!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 471, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 720.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
