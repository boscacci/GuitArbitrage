{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a beautiful 1996 American Vintage Reissue 57' Fender Stratocaster. Only thing better than how it looks is how it sounds. This now 23 year old Stratocaster is getting its own vintage mojo like the 62 year old guitars it pays tribute to. These AVRIs are some of the best strats you can find. Really good job of reproducing all the appointments, specs, and characteristics of a 1957 Strat. This was a guitar made in limited batches and was never a standard model, proudly made in the U.S.A. From top to bottom, this Strat rates off-the-charts. Everything looks feels very nice in your hands, & plays like butter. The pickups are awesome and have the power, clarity & attitude that defined the sound of rock n roll. She weighs 7 lbs 12 oz\u2019s thanks to a high-quality super light alder body that enhances the tone & sustain. Maple neck & fretboard just like got shipped in 1957. The nickel hardware looks very classy and pop out on the thin Fiesta Red nitro finish. This guitar is a great example of the quality and exquisite craftsmanship that came out of the Fender factory in the mid 90's. This guitar will please the ears as much as the eyes and the pickups are absolutely wonderful, they are warm and responsive and capture classic strat tones. Shipping the the U.S. only. Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions.delicious.", "ItemID": "233104151438", "EndTime": "2019-01-26T20:13:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T20:13:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1996-Fender-57-Stratocaster-Fiesta-Red-AVRI-1957-7lbs-12-oz-/233104151438", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "South Windsor, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331041514388080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5Mjg=/z/tZEAAOSwZqlcRiWV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5MzU=/z/ddcAAOSw-iZcRiVz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5MTg=/z/N~4AAOSwe~lcRiV4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODI4WDEyODA=/z/GEsAAOSw1rpcRiV9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxOFgxMjY4/z/5g8AAOSwSn1cRiWA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODgxWDEyODA=/z/CioAAOSwRbpcRiWE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5MzU=/z/MBcAAOSwfBlcRiWJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5NFgxMjA0/z/gUcAAOSwu3ZcRiWN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5MzY=/z/8TUAAOSwdgxcRiWQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "06074", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "musicden", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1665, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1294.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1294.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 323}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1996 Fender 57' Stratocaster Fiesta Red AVRI 1957 7lbs 12 oz", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Fiesta Red"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["1957 AVRI"]}]}, "HitCount": 203, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1319.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
