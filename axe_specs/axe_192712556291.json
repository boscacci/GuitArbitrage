{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is my prized modified PEAVEY 6505+. The reason I'm selling it is because I have a MODED JADED FAITH MODULE that covers these tones and a EVH III STEALTH! No other discounting will be made! If this price doesn't work for you move along!This is a very very nice amp and sounds ABSOLUTELY KILLER! It's been modified to breath better, it has new power tubes and my secret weapons...RETROVALVES! You won't find a nicer or better sounding one ANYWHERE! I pride myself in only having the best of the best too. This thing loves getting hit in the face with a PRESICION DRIVE but my TS 880, RANDALL FACEPUNCH and a EAST RIVER works great too! But I always come back to the P DRIVE pedel when going for ultimate SUPER CHUNK in \"B\" tuning. It's a workhorse too and I've hurt a few souls when I run this to 2, 4-12 cabs using the P DRIVE in front and one of my ROCKTRON REPLIFLEXs in the effects chain. SUPER CHUNCK...No...SUPER DUPER SUPER CHUNK! I keep all my tone generators in tiptop shape with fresh tubes and retrovalves preamp tubes and this one is no different! I use both the yellow and blues in this because that gave me searing sustain and fabulous cleans. 99% of my metal guitars have BLACKOUTS in the bridge position and are simply fing KILLER but I have run SD INVADERS for years and still have a few that have those passive in them. The amp loves both! I also use 60-13s strings on my D-tuned guitars and all I can say is ....YES!!!!! That KILLS! When I ship tube amps the power tubes are always removed, numbered, wrapped and then their locations are mapped so you won't need to have bias reset. I have 100% feedback and aim to please my buyers...even though there are some real boneheads here on eBay...Good Luck!
