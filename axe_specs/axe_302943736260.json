This stunning Las Paul Standard is a flat solid top style hearkening to the original Black Beauty look. With all the heft and the exquisite balance of the original this right handed Les Paul features a Mahogany body with maple top, the coveted Les Paul tune-o-matic bridge system, dual humbuckers, and a rosewood fingerboard with the iconic trapezoidal insets. This quality Epiphone was made in February of 2018 at the Qingdao plant in production run 6310 and has very little play on it. In fact, the bridge height hasn't even been adjusted yet. The previous owner got it, strummed it a bit, and then realized that he wasn't going to be Jimmy Page over night and sold it to us. It has been sitting on a shelf for the past 4 months (since June of 2018) awaiting its new owner. there are some minimal signs of use and play, but you'll be hard pressed to find notable blemishes on this fine Les Paul. From the Website: This plain top Epiphone Les Paul Standard is an electric guitar that delivers all the signature sound of a Gibson Les Paul at a fraction of the cost. The mahogany body provides superb resonance while the Alnico Classic humbucker pickups deliver loads of warmth. The set mahogany neck with slim-tapered profile and rosewood fretboard give you the familiar feel and fast action that Les Paul players love so dearly. Neck and body binding and trapezoid inlays produce the classic look seen on stages around the world for decades. The LockTone Tune-O-Matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece provide more sustain and string changing easier.
