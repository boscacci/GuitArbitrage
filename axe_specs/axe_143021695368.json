{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here we have slightly used Chinese 325/1996. Not a bad way to get the Lennon etc vibe without spending a fortune. I really do like it even with typical flaws that come with the cheapo Chinese stuff. BUT the neck is just too fat for my aching hands. Has factory lumps and bumps and paint runs in finish and swirls but no major scratches or nicks or scrapes. Chromes nice and shiny, minor marks from picks on pickups fret jobs not the best but it doesnt fret out anywhere.minimal fret wear. The two little holes pictured at bottom was from where I had put a trapeze, All pickups work ,and they are all 7K humbuckers that are quiet as heck. Its wired almost like original, with neck and middle wired together. but the 5th knob is a master volume. Tuners were junk so its got reasonable Grovers on it now. Still has plastic peal off film on it. Plastic is not the best so it doesnt sit flat. I think the neck angle was set wrong (see pics) .Saddle set nuts have some wear . For what it is , it works and plays and stays in tune reasonably well . Has 11 gauge strings on which seem to work. Changed nut because it was crap. Didn't do a perfect job but its better than it was. Its white glued in so you can change or adjust easily if you want. Little or no or hidden feedback please dont waste my time. No international bidders (only Canada ) Any questions ask thru ebay. i will add more info as I think of it.Sold as is where as. No warranty expressed or implied (hate writing that blah blah) wait for me to invoice because I insist on insurance and its never included in their shipping costs. Priced below what I put in and duty costs. you wont get one from the factory like this with the bugs worked out for the most part.. happy biddin\" !!!", "ItemID": "143021695368", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T02:23:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-21T02:23:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/325-1996-Lennon-Fogerty-Beatles-CCR-no-name-electric-guitar-/143021695368", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "West Chazy, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430216953688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Hq8AAOSwdrpb0RrH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SnoAAOSwaXpb0RrY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ytUAAOSw6dhb0Rr0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OlkAAOSw40Zb0RsF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3u8AAOSwTitb0RsS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YJwAAOSw-nRb0Rsm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zzsAAOSwoM5b0Rsx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XGQAAOSwsupb0RtH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XGEAAOSw5atb0Rta/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7JIAAOSwVYhb0Rt0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qhsAAOSwZPdb0Rue/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "12992", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pioneersofdisaster", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 147, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 65}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "325 1996 , Lennon Fogerty Beatles CCR no name  electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Short Scale"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["cherry sunburst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["six string"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["no name"]}]}, "HitCount": 59, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 280.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "RU", "AL", "AD", "AT", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "GI", "GR", "GG", "HU", "IS", "IE", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LI", "LT", "LU", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "NL", "NO", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SJ", "SE", "CH", "UA", "VA", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "few months old, cheap way to get that 325/1996 vibe !!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
