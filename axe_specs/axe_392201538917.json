This is really cool. You are looking at a 2004 Fender 50th Anniversary Golden Stratocaster. There were only 500 of these built in 2004 for the 50th Anniversary (1954-2004) of the Iconic Strat. Since it is the \"Golden Anniversary\" of the Strat, it is a beautiful Aztec Gold finish with gold pickguard and all hardware is gold. The former owner even purchased the higher end Fender USA G&G Anniversary Tweed Case!What better way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Strat than with a cool commemorative model? In 2004 Fender offered several anniversary models. This all gold 50\u2019s reissue is one of my favorites. All of the vibe and cool looks of a 50\u2019s Strat at a killer price! The body is solid alder for great tone. The one piece, soft V shaped maple neck features a 7.25 inch radius maple fingerboard with 21 vintage style frets. A trio of staggered Alnico magnet pickups dish out classic tone. A vintage style trem and tuners round out the package. To really set this one off, the hardware is gold plated and the pickguard is gold anodized aluminum. It really sets off the Aztec Gold finish. An incredible looking and performing guitar.This Strat has great vintage feel and tone. The soft V shaped neck plays great and has nice action. The pickups and electronics work fine and sound good. Has that \"Classic\" Fender Sound. Piercing clean tone. A Strat is definitely the most versatile guitar on the planet. Whatever your type of music. Rock, Blues, Country, Pop or Surf , a Strat will do the job. From Hendrix to Dick Dale a Strat is always there somewhere in the mix.This model was only available in 2004 and has long since sold out. You won\u2019t find a new model with this finish and gold hardware. A really striking guitar! Our luthier did a complete setup. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival!

Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. Cosmetics: Excellent Condition. Pristine. Dripping with \"Mojo\". It is used. Not perfect.
