Rare Gibson USA Promo Guitar! 2008 Gibson Les Paul Special New Century Red Man Snuff Promo GuitarEbony BoardNo real play wear, but minor signs of display and head stock repair (fell off stand) With 90's Gibson Brown Cali Girl Hard Case I've looked high and low, but haven't found another like it PLEASE DO NOT mistake picture glare for flaws.. If you think your seeing something not mentioned in this listing, please ask!! There are lots of pics, so when you receive it, its exactly what you expected, if not better. No surprises with this sale.. Buy with confidence! Here's The Run Down: This is a Very Clean & Rare 2008 Gibson USA Les Paul Special New Century RED MAN Snuff that was a display piece, never really used, but had a head stock repair due to falling off the display stand. This was most likely a 1 off promo guitar for a RED MAN event of some kind. The repair is solid and the guitar can be used as it sits. It could easily be cosmetically done better given the black back. The RED MAN SNUFF Graphics are super cool and definitely an eye catcher. This guitar is completely original with pics of the controls and pickups included within this listing (see all pics). There will be minor flaws from handling and display, but nothing significant enough to picture or specifically mention other than the repair (see pics). Flaws may consist of minor scratching, scuffs and/or marks here or there. There is a small corner of the plexiglass that is cracked near the screw (pictured). There is NO minor fret wear or buckle rash to note. The original hardware is in great condition overall. I tried to take really good pics, so you can judge for yourself (see pics). There are NO changes and the guitar is completely original. All electronics are original and operate perfectly. If your looking for a super cool USA Gibson that your friends or anyone else doesn't have and wont break the bank, this would make a great addition to your collection! ***Will come exactly as pictured*** This Gibson USA Promo Guitar sounds and plays great. Although I think its set up great, everyone has their own preferences. If your not happy with its set up, it will be your responsibility and cost to have it set up to your liking. The neck is straight and the truss rod operates as it should. All electronics are original and perfect! The Included Gibson Brown Hard Case is in good usable condition. All latches, hinges & handle operate as they should. The combination lock is set to zero and works, but the latch is missing. The pink interior cover is also missing. It will have marks, scuffs & wear/tear here or there from moving it around and age, but still a Original Gibson Brown Case. Everything operates as it should, and has never had, nor does it have any breaks or repairs unless noted above.
