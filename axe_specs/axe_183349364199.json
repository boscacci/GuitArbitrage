{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vigier Excalibur Shawn Lane Signature. I purchased this guitar in early 2016, but I believe it is a 2015 model. It has the Neutrik locking jack, which is a feature that Vigier added starting in 2015, I believe. The older models do not have this feature.The guitar is in Very Good used condition. I purchased this guitar as a Shawn Lane fan, hoping that it would get me a few inches closer to his technique and execution. Also, I wanted to find a guitar that would help me play Eric Johnson stuff. The playability of this guitar is unparalleled. As you know, the action is incredibly and impossibly low. It would be difficult to fit two playing cards between the strings and the frets. It is really insane, and it makes execution much easier. If you look at reviews, you find people say that the perfectly flat fretboard takes some getting used to. I did not find this to the be the case. If you have played 12\", 14\", or 16\" radius boards, or compound radius boards, the feel is not much different. The action is lower, however, to a point that it seems impossible that there is not buzzing. It is an engineering marvel. Also, and I wasn't expecting the fantastic feel and comfort of the neck. It is very 'gripable' and feels great. If I could take this neck feel and put it on other guitars, wow. There is no truss rod in the neck, just a carbon fiber rod that keeps the neck perfectly flat at all times. Shortly after purchasing the guitar, I decided to try different pickups. I took it to a Luthier -not just a guitar tech- and he installed a different pickup assembly. The original pickup assembly was removed as a whole unit, so there was not a lot of soldering happening. This Luthier with over 40 years experience re-installed the original assembly like new. As you will see in the photos, there is hardly even any finger oils on the fretboard. This Excalibur has essentially been unplayed since mid-2016 and it is time for me to part with it. So...if you are looking to save hundreds, here is an opportunity for an as-close-to-new-as-used-gets Shawn Lane Signature. It has been living in its case in my smoke free home. The case and guitar are very clean and odor free. Shoot me some questions if you like. I am a player too, and I will ship the guitar well, with good padding and protection. I will ship internationally, but please contact me first so we can work out the shipping details.", "ItemID": "183349364199", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T15:02:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-07-29T01:17:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vigier-Excalibur-Shawn-Lane-Signature-Natural-/183349364199", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Spring, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1833493641998080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sQcAAOSw~B9bhMdq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gz0AAOSwXOBbhMez/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gscAAOSwXOBbhMd2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HlcAAOSw5Z5bhMeA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1o4AAOSwFWdbhMeG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jXAAAOSw3JRbhMeK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EwcAAOSwZCxbhMeN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0XEAAOSw5OZbhMem/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wEAAAOSw5WVbhMfX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZScAAOSwwVBbhMfk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hVUAAOSwjexbhMfp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/p6AAAOSwefxbhMfs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "77379", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ainzo85", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 217, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2285.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2285.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 242}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vigier Excalibur Shawn Lane Signature Natural", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Vigier"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 1424, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
