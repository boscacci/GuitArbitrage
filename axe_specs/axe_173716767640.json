{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 2016 Fender Traditional 60s Telecaster in near mint condition with a custom color Black gloss finish. Made exclusively for the Japanese domestic market, this Tele is rarely seen outside its country of origin. Tonally, this Telecaster takes advantage of the guitar's tone wood compliment, and the smooth, balanced tone of the alder body translates well through the stock single coil pickups. The thick slab rosewood fretboard adds warmth and fullness to the sound, and the solid maple neck rounds out this classic reissue Tele. The bridge pickup has plenty of zing and snap and the neck pickup is throaty and warm without losing definition. The guitar weighs in at 7lbs 6oz and has a crisp, pleasing acoustic voice. Professionally setup here at Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar, this Tele is dialed in with 10-46 strings, comfortable action, and accurate intonation.The neck has a medium C shaped profile that borders on the slender side of things with a flawless gloss finish, perfect frets, and a notably thick slab rosewood fretboard with a chocolate brown color. The guitar conforms to traditional Fender specifications with a 7 1/4\" fretboard radius, 25 1/2\" scale length, and 1 11/16\" nut width. The headstock has a '60s-style logo and chrome Kluson-style tuners that turn smoothly.All of the electronics work as intended, the chrome hardware is flawless, and cosmetically the gloss black finish shows only a few tiny scuffs on the guitar as a whole. This guitar is essentially showroom clean and a great example of the quality vintage reissue Fender instruments currently being produced by Fender Japan. The original hangtags are included.
