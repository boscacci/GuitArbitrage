{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! shipping to the lower 48 states only.I will not ship anywhere else.Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone by Gibson SG Junior in a See thru Cherryfinish with some nice upgrades. Guitar looks great with only mild surface scratches. First I traded out the closed back tuners with some nice vintage Kluson style tuners.You can still see some of the holes on the back of the headstock from the old cheapie tuners. I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. I swapped out the stock pickup for a nice Hot Double Cream 4 wire Humbucker pickup metering about 15k .Next I installed a push/pull tone control so you can split the humbucker into a single coil. I also upgraded the stock tone capacitor with some a .022uf Orange Drop style epoxy film cap. Sounded very full on clean tones and growled like a hungry baby tiger once I added some gain. This pickup sounds great in this guitar. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. Guitar looks great. Neck shows near zero fret wear. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. IF YOU LEFT CLICK YOUR MOUSE ON ANY OF THE PICTURES THEY WILL ENLARGE FOR A BETTER VIEW. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
