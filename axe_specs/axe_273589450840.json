{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a Fender Jaguar body Not sure whether it was made in Mexico or Japan as it was as you see it on the photos when I purchased it. According to the seller, guitar was refinished in California Blue and resprayed in Dakota Red in order to relic it so the blue would show underneath red. Purchased this item as it is in order to build a guitar but it never happened. Was working on 3 Fender Jaguar projects in the last 2 years but I found myself just collecting parts rather than putting together guitars and decided to sell all of them as I have enough guitars. Please have a look on my other auctions for more Fender Jaguar fun and a few pedals. Trust my feedback! Any questions please let me know! Starts at 99p! Happy Bidding :) PLEASE NOTE : If you buy 2 or more of my items I\u2019ll combine postage, you only pay what I pay :) Postage : If less than what is mentioned on my ad, the difference will be send back to your PayPal once I dispatch the item.
