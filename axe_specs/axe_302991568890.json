{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Mk3 is the biggest and the most versatile series in the entire BC Rich catalog. Bolt-on construction, stock hardware, and BC Rich`s own pickups are main features of this super-affordable series. Mk3 Jr. V was inspired by the recent BC Rich V models, taking a lot from them. Under the hood, this mighty V features a solid mahogany body (multi-part construction, beveled edges), maple neck (four-bolt joint, fast contour), and rosewood fingerboard (24 jumbo frets, diamond inlays, 1.65\" locking nut, 13.75\" radius). Main hardware & electronics options include a licensed Floyd Rose bridge, die-cast tuners, and BC Rich pickups. This guitar has many cosmetic flaws. When I got it, it had apparently been damaged in the shipping process. It has what looks to be just a paint deep crack on the bottom side of the body where the neck fits in. It also has a crack that goes from the back of the headstock to the front, from the back of the A string tuning peg to the front of it. Also, the tip of the headstock is chipped, and so is the tip of the top body wing.
