{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello. My name is Jerry and I am a guitar-aholic. I never played a guitar I didn't want to take home. My compulsion is to shop in the best guitar stores and internet guitar sites I have traveled out of state just to guitar shop and spent hours on the internet looking for just the right guitar\u2026just the right deal. It must have been a conquest thing because after I bought them, I typically placed them in the case and stacked them in the guitar room thinking one day I would need that guitar. I have acquired over 50 guitars mostly Gibson, Fender. It was a great ride, but it\u2019s over. When I turned 67 last year I decided to retire. I am too old to keep chasing these young guitars so I have decided to help them find new homes. I have about a dozen guitars that I am keeping because they remind me of the old days and the old bands. The rest are up for sale. Some of the guitars I will be selling are like right out of the box and right in to my guitar-room new. Others I bought to upgrade and play.This is an old time highest bid wins auction! The guitar is a limited run Gibson SG 3 pick up in satin black. The guitar is almost like new. I had to have it for my collection but never took it to a gig. It has the 6 position switch that allows for all sorts of combinations. I am a basic neck and bridge position player so it was more guitar than I needed. The satin finish really lets the mahogany sing. Great sustain and easy to play with a low loose feel. Neck is straight and frets are hardly used. The guitar will be shipped via FedEX in a musical instrument box. No case is provided. Look at the pictures. Ask any questions. No refunds. No international bidders, please. Will ship Fed EX to US (48 states) destinations only. Please use PayPal. If shipping is less than $49. I\u2019ll return the difference. More than likely I\u2019ll pay the difference at FedEx.
