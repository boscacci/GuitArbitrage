{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a MIJ OFFICIAL CHARVEL electric guitar. This is NOT a clone or a put togather copy. I have done my research. Guitar has been completely cleaned up. Restrung and Intonated. Plays like a CHARVEL should. These are very sought after guitars. They were quality made back in the 80s and 90s. Selling because i have too many guitars. Comes with a hard shell chainsaw style Charvel case. Which is worth $150.00 alone. Please see the info i posted below. i have this for sale locally and reserve the right to end auction early. Thanks None of these guitars were made in USA. The neck plates on the bolt-on neck Charvel Model Series bear IMC's Fort Worth Texas address, despite the fact that they were all built in Japan. The address reads: Fort Worth, TX 76113, U.S.A. All the Charvel imports in the scope of this article (1986-91), are made in Japan (except the Charvette Series which is made in Korea).IMC (International Music Corporation), who in 1985 merged with Jackson Charvel, was based in Fort Worth, Texas and having their USA P.O. address on the neck plate, was probably a sleek marketing trick to have us believe the models were made in USA.In all fairness it should be said, that the bolt-ons had a small MADE IN JAPANsticker placed on the back of the neck at the heel (not like in the picture to the right, where is has been moved to the neck plate). This sticker told us the true origin, but it was easy to remove or would easily fall off. The Ft. Worth PO stamp seemed to disappear from the neck plates, when the Model Series ended in 1989 and the other Charvel Series took over.This was also around the time when IMC moved most of the Jackson production to Japan and Grover Jackson sold his interests in the company to IMC.The picture to the right shows the neck plate from a late 1990 Charvel 475 Deluxe and the stamp is gone.", "ItemID": "223224800346", "EndTime": "2018-11-17T04:50:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-10T04:50:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Charvel-MIJ-electric-guitar-1989-model-/223224800346", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Saint Cloud, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232248003468080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/y6cAAOSw-5tb3GFA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nAUAAOSwAVlb3GEs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VP0AAOSwsptb3GB2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hh0AAOSwxxVb3GCC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YNYAAOSwNo9b3GCP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HN4AAOSwA65b3GCg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JCwAAOSw7Spb3GCs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AAMAAOSwY2Jb3GC~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-W8AAOSwnJtb3GDR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xSkAAOSwcOZb3GDg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2cQAAOSwxZxb3GDs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/R8kAAOSwxx9b3GEA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "34773", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "racecrazy88", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 388, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 8905}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Charvel MIJ electric guitar 1989 model", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1991"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["370"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Strat style"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 716, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 330.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used with minor scratches from playing over the years.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
