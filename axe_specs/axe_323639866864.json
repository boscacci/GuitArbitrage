{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a very clean Les Paul Custom Black Beauty! The Serial Number is 70268100, which dates it to January 26, 1978, the 100th unit from the Kalamazoo factory. It's 100% original, no modifications have been made. The body is very clean overall with no major dings, scratches or other issues. There are some minor streaks and marks visible when viewed in the light. There is some buckle rash on the back, but it has not broken through the finish. Just the right amount of wear for a vintage guitar! The neck is straight and the frets show minimal wear. It's in excellent playing condition with no dead frets or other major issues. The fretboard is clean and the back of the neck has no major marks or finish loss. There are no cracks, repairs or extra holes. The gold hardware has some wear and tarnish, but everything in excellent working condition. It comes with the original \"chainsaw\" case which has no major wear. All three plastic latches work, which is rare! This guitar plays great and was setup with Ernie Ball 10's which are the only strings that have been on it. You may need to change the strings, adjust the action or change the setup to get it to your preferences.", "ItemID": "323639866864", "EndTime": "2019-01-22T07:40:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-08T02:25:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1978-Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom-Excellent-Condition-w-Gibson-chain-saw-case-/323639866864", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Midland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236398668648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Z1QAAOSwMpFcC-S5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/nhAAAOSwSudcC-S7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/i7AAAOSwX6RcC-S9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/6MQAAOSweRdcC-S~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/2KgAAOSwP8dcC-y2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "L4R5C5", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ironside1036", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 49, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3243.08, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4300.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "w***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 12}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1978 Gibson Les Paul Custom, Excellent Condition, w Gibson chain saw case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1978"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["1978 Les Paul Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["70268100"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 404, "Subtitle": "You don't want to miss out on this one!!", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition based on the Reverb web site criteria!!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
