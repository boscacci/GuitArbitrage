{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Please note that I am a long-time guitar seller on eBay with over $171,000 in sales and 100% feedback!! Welcome to a great find on eBay for all of you players who would like to add something \"different to their \"performance\". This is a 1985 GIBSON SG. Its fire red color suits the sounds that it produces. First, the standard SG pickups were replaced with hand-made \"monster buckers\" that are beyond belief. These white and gold buckers are Iron Man pups designed by Jim Wagner, one of the greatest humbucker builders in the world. Check out his company WCR on the west coast. WCR Iron Man Humbucking Pickups With an amazing power/resistance rating of 22K pushed out by its Ceramic 8 magnets, you have at your fingertips tons of tone, harmonics, and pinch squeals all OVER the guitar neck. Some praise from players: \"The Iron Man is the most musically complex and powerful pickup ever used.....\"\"Jim, I would most definitely say it is YOU who are the king! Your humbuckers are the best in the world..... nothing else comes close.....\" \"Thanks for the \"killer tone. We had an awesome time with them in our recent European tour.\" Feel free to research WCR Iron Man pickups and see for yourself. They produce a once in a lifetime tone! Incidentally, these pups are now selling for $195 a piece. And I cannot overlook their beauty with white casings and gold pole pieces. Speaking about \"gold\", I upgraded all of the hardware on this SG to gold to match the humbuckers. {see pictures}. Even the Kluson tuning pegs are gold. Not only does it sound great, but it looks great. Since this SG dates back to 1985 (making it a mature 33 years old), I believe it has been repainted with bright fire engine red nitrocellulose. The fret board is very dark in color and the back of the neck is very smooth with only one tiny wear mark under the head stock. There are also two tiny dings on the back of the neck but absolutely nothing interferes with the play-ability of this red beast. Besides that, there is some light checking in the nitrocellulose which is common in almost all older guitars. Frets do not have much wear and look new! One Unique Feature........ note that the SG pickguard has been removed showing the bright red nitro over the entire guitar's body. This looks really cool with the white pickups with gold hardware. This guitar comes in an age-appropriate Epiphone case that cradles and protects the guitar perfectly. This sizzling ax is far superior than anything out their today and it certainly has its own unique tone. Also, it is a lighter guitar and would be perfect for a female player who loves to rock. I have sold many guitars on eBay but have been out of the business for the last few years. I hope all of my outstanding feedback is still available for all interested buyers. Finally, I would be happy to answer any questions by email on eBay or................... you can call me at home (772-492-3699). Thanks for looking....Rick. Oh.......... This 22K Beast can be purchased at......... $675.00 and good luck playing it!!!", "ItemID": "283149538247", "EndTime": "2019-01-05T00:29:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-08T21:33:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/GIBSON-SG-Red-Gold-Special-sizzling-Iron-Man-buckers-22K-/283149538247", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Vero Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2831495382478080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/MxsAAOSwbVdbkVNy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYyWDE2MDA=/z/xCAAAOSwVzdbkVOY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY1WDE2MDA=/z/WzQAAOSwoIpbkVOg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxOFgxNjAw/z/7VoAAOSwLxpbkVOn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/K30AAOSw6zNbkVOx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DosAAOSwaGBbkVO7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/XWcAAOSwfLpbkVPF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/atQAAOSwr8tbkVPS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/2skAAOSwn6RbkVPe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA0MlgxNjAw/z/9LIAAOSwiQlbkVPz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/r7EAAOSwvIFbkVP8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/GngAAOSwuThbkVQ9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32968", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ramdoc333bc", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1547, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.6}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 675.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 675.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4776}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "GIBSON SG\u00a0 \"Red/Gold Special\" with sizzling \"Iron Man\" buckers (22K) !!!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1985"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Special"]}, {"Name": "Applicable Regions", "Value": ["US only"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Double Cutaway"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["WCR Iron Man pups"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 1128, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
