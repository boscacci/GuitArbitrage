{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I'm selling my 2011 Gibson SG Standard. It's in excellent shape with barely a scratch on it and the frets have very little wear. It plays perfectly up and down the neck. No fret buzz at all. I'm pretty much a Fender guy, but I always wanted an SG. Found this one used last year at a local music store and I had to have it. The pickups had already been changed (saved me the trouble) to Seymour Duncan Seth Lovers when I found it, and I must say they did a very professional job. Very neat soldering job and they sound nice in this guitar. The neck profile is wonderful. Not to fat and not too thin. I just weighed it on a postal scale at 6Lbs 13oz. and it is not neck heavy. Perfectly balanced. I'm sure you've heard this before, but I really hate to sell it. Anyway, I'm still a Fender guy so this SG doesn't get much use. No international shipping. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking. I just notice in the photo of the back of the guitar it looks like there is a gouge in the finish. That's just bad photography on my part. The finish is basically perfect for an 8 year old guitar.", "ItemID": "273641574837", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T22:15:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T22:15:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2011-Gibson-SG-Standard-/273641574837", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Campbellsport, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736415748378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PmgAAOSwbjNcMSVa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IIkAAOSwZKlcMSV3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5dkAAOSwT5tcMSWM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gs4AAOSwPA1cMSWn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vYAAAOSwuZVcMSW2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RPYAAOSwDYdcMSXH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r4QAAOSwLeFcMSXY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U2IAAOSw6EpcMSXx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fJYAAOSwiJZcMSYH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fZcAAOSwrZBcMSYa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53010", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tomguitar58", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 34}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2011 Gibson SG Standard", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Original pickups replaced with Seymour Duncan Seth Lover pickups."]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 545, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1050.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
