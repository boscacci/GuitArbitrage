Originally introduced as an Anniversary model with SCN pickups. It was also released by GC under the name, \u201cAmerican Special Series\u201d. When we introduced the American Special Series instruments,...the name of these were changed from American Special to American Select. When the price point of the American Deluxe guitars went up, GC wanted to keep this guitar in their lineup at the same price point. This was achieved by replacing the pickguard assembly with an American Series loaded with Tex-Mex pickups. The guitar caught on well and was kept on as a proprietary FSR for them and Musician\u2019s FriendWRENCH SIZES: Truss Rod Wrench p/n 0018622000 (3/32\u201d Hex)Saddle Height Adjustment Wrench p/n 0018531000 (.050 Hex)", "ItemID": "132907496489", "EndTime": "2019-01-03T18:50:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T18:13:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-Fender-American-Select-Mahogany-FSR-Deluxe-Stratocaster-HSS-Electric-Guitar-/132907496489", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Danbury, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329074964898080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GWUAAOSwWrxcGpM4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sX0AAOSwjfdcGpM5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6wMAAOSwnZJcGpM5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1W4AAOSwJ~xcGpM6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FfwAAOSwSudcGpM4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NsEAAOSwq6VcGpM5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uMAAAOSw0vJcGpM5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06810", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "byron737499", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 142, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1080.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1080.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***5", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 219}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2006 Fender American Select Mahogany FSR Deluxe Stratocaster HSS Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["113302705"]}]}, "HitCount": 13, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "219517709", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
