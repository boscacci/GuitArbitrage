Some scuffs and minor scratches. No big damage on body. See pictures for quality. I upgraded the pickups from the stock to Gibson 490R/T combo which sounds great and prevented me from buying a real LP! This hasn't been played in a while. I am removing the strings before sale. It will need a setup. The pickup selector knob is missing. A friend installed the pickups backwards. The pickup selector knob selects the opposite pickup from the label but still works fine. Something I just got used to since I didn't have the tools to fix it. The volume/tone knobs are all wired correctly and work as expected. Still plays well and sounds great. If you have any questions or want more pictures just let me know!
