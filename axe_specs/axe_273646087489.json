Some more information in the Tulip model of Teisco Del Ray guitars: TulipsTwo new models that would eventually become mainstays joined the Teisco line in \u201965. Theye were two double cuts with slightly more flared horns, in a sort of tulip shape. Both had a single, wide, chrome-covered pickup with poles exposed along one edge. This was similar to the old MJ-1 but by \u201965 would become the new SM series. Both had bolt-on necks with bound rosewood fretboards and the top-edge rectangular inlays. The E-100 had a bridge/tailpiece assembly, volume and tone on a small pickguard, and one of the elongated Strat-style heads. The ET-100 had a platform vibrato. As a sign of things to come, the Teisco Del Rey ET-100 had a regular Strat-style headstock, the first to appear on Teiscos, as far as I\u2019m aware.Finishes shown in the \u201965 Teisco Del Rey catalog included a black/brown tobacco sunburst, a fire-engine red and a metallic silver. Many pickguards were brushed metal. WE REQUIRE ALL BIDDERS TO HAVE AT LEAST A POSITIVE FEED BACK OF 5.PLEASE CONTACT US WITHIN 24 HOURS OF WINNING THE BID.
