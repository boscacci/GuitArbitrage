{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson Explorer 1983 White Sparkle This guitar is in fair condition. This guitar is NOT all original. There were modifications: repainted to a white sparkle (previous owner), I removed the EMG pickups it came with and installed Gibson Tim Shaw Pickups PAF. The Gibson Tremolo is original (I do not have the whammy bar), the Gibson Grover Tuners are original also. The pickguard and rear cavity cover are non-original. It has a rosewood fretboard and the neck is smooth while playing. The frets still have life. Its light so I believe its probably an alder body with a maple neck. It does have finish cracks, dings and dents as shown in the pictures. I tried my best to show every detail in the pictures. It was recently set up and plays really nice. It is by no means a collector's item, but its great for someone looking to add a 1983 Explorer to their own collection. See the detailed pictures of the actual guitar. I keep all of my guitars well maintained, waxed, wiped down, stored in their cases and boxed in a climate controlled room. I worked hard to clean this one up and it really came out nice. Its now time to move on to another project. The guitar comes with a really nice Gibson hardshell case that I found for it. All latches & the handle work just fine. I ship every guitar fast and pack safely. Signature is required upon delivery. Check out my proud feedback for reassurance.Feel free to ask questions and all respectful offers are welcome.Thank you for your interest! *Item is being sold on another site and store.
