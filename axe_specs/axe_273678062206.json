{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale: 1987 Black Gibson ES-335 Studio Model, Made in U.S.A. The 1980\u2019s Gibson Studio Model 335s featured ebony fingerboards and a Non F hole body. These guitars were a cross between 335 and Les Paul. This guitar has been heavily modified with custom details. I wanted the look of 335/345/355 and a black Les Paul custom. This is a fully customized guitar...all work was done professionally by my luthier. The headstock was refinished with mother of pearl Gibson logo and split diamond inlay. The neck and headstock were refitted with binding. The fingerboard was refretted and inlayed with mother of pearl blocks. The stop tailpiece and original location of input jack was filled in. The top was refinished in black nitro lacquer. The jack was moved to where it would be on Les Paul. The rare Gibson parallelogram tailpiece adds a lot of character. Chrome mini Gotoh bridge with Tusq saddles and nut. The pickups are vintage Ibanez Super 58 humbuckers...best reproduction PAF pickups ever made. The neck was stripped of lacquer and applied in Oil finish. Very smooth and fast playing. The neck is straight and action is low. This guitar has the sound of a LP and 335. All was professionally done and exceptional in detail. This Guitar shows age and signs of use. The lacquer finish shows cracks. This is a players made guitar and is setup to play! Hardshell case will be included with the auction. Yes, I do ship international. Please send location for price. Sold as is. Please ask any and all questions before bidding.
