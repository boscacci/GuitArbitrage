{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is an Epiphone ET 290 Deluxe Professional from the 1970s. These are very similar to the ET 278s but have gold hardware. The uncommon natural finish one has dot markers, gold hardware and maple fretboard. It's a beautiful, well made guitar. 24.75\" scale. Gold finish on hardware has a good deal of wear leaving a beautiful vintage patina. Body has some scratches, nicks, dings (mostly small) and finish wear from over 40 years of handling and play. Two larger impact marks on sides of lower bout. A number of very small finish bubbles (about 15) on back. Might be tiny, dried, clear droplets of something like nail polish. The guitar looks very nice. The play wear is appropriate for a guitar this old that was used but not abused. There is a small crack at the rear of the body adjacent to the rear, treble side neck screw. Have had this guitar for almost ten years and have not had any issues with it. Medium+ fret wear. Usable meat left on frets. Has not been played in years so the frets could use a polish. A few relatively minor guitar stand/play marks on back of neck. Some finish wear on back of neck. Headstock has some light scratches and a few minor nicks. Some scuffs and nicks around sides and edges. Tuners are great but not original. Electronics sound great. Might be some slight scratchiness in pots from storage. Switch is a bit scratchy but should clean up with use. Jack is spotty and could us a good cleaning. Nut is approximately 1.585\" wide (about 41mm). Guitar weighs (as shown in photos) 7 pounds, 12.8 ounces. An outstanding 40+ year old, quality Japanese made and fairly rare Epiphone that is truly undervalued in today's market. Includes hard case (decent condition) shown in first photo. Have a some extra photos that are available upon request.
