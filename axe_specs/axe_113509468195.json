{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello folks, selling a very nice Gibson 275. I picked this up shortly after these were first produced in 2016. It had been purchased new previously by someone who had done some amateurish work on the frets, so I decided to refret the guitar. It's been fitted with Jescar Evo Gold 0.090 X 0.055 fretwire and the playability is excellent. The truss rod works well across the adjustment range, and there's no hump at the body. I also improved the fit of the wooden bridge foot to the top and replaced the tuneamatic bridge with a current redesigned 2018 Gibson ABR1 with titanium saddles and no annoying retaining wire that rattles. I'll also include a custom made archtop style wooden bridge saddle I carved for this guitar. That bridge was cut using Thomastik flatwound 0.12's for intonation purposes - just swap it in for more acoustic archtop guitar sound. I work as a luthier and all this work was done according to high standards. It's been used on gigs and rehearsals and there are some tiny marks, but nothing that stands out. Note that some lacquer did peel away from the side of the fingerboard around the 4th fret. Also, the previous owner \"deglossed\" the neck heel and you can see some cross grain scratches in the finish there. It would be easy to touch up the lacquer and polish out the neck scuffing but I haven't bothered. Also I noticed that one pickup ring is cracked by one of the screws and the other ring has a scratch - just being thorough in my description. But otherwise the guitar looks close to new. The case is a bit scuffed, but nothing major. I've enjoyed playing this guitar in a variety of jazz related musical settings, but I''m on to other projects - time to let someone else enjoy it rather than have it sit neglected.\u2003At 5'7\" I look for smaller guitars and the size and fit here is perfect. Upper fret access with the 275 is better than with the typical archtop neck join at the 14th fret. And the neck has a nice feel, bigger than the \"slim taper\", but smaller than the \"59\" - similar in size to many Heritage guitars.Relisted due to a non payment.", "ItemID": "113509468195", "EndTime": "2019-01-18T20:11:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T21:38:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2016-Gibson-ES-275-guitar-excellent-condition-case-two-bridges-and-C-O-A-/113509468195", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Madison, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135094681958080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/620AAOSwvhxcAZ9D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njc1WDkwMA==/z/naQAAOSw5wJcAZ-s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HP8AAOSw8MxcAZ9K/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RBEAAOSwT2BcAZ9S/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZA8AAOSwlkpcAZ9a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8FMAAOSw9xJcAZ9k/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~04AAOSwwkRcAZ9t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zGYAAOSw27lcAZ92/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kgUAAOSwEOJcAZ-G/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I9YAAOSwNTNcAZ-R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1jcAAOSwsqdcAZ-i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1W0AAOSw~atcAZ~C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53716", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "elhombre5000", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 793, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 11}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "BH", "HR", "MY", "PA", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2016 Gibson ES 275 guitar excellent condition with case, two bridges and C.O.A.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-275"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "Original knobs are in the case."]}]}, "HitCount": 224, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
