This is a no reserve auction, so bid to win. Good luck! **I ended this auction and relisted it after there seemed to be some confusion about the serial number. Let me clean that up exactly. This is a 1977. The confusion about the serial number came from the (06) 185534. During the period from 1975-1977 Gibson used a transfer that had eight-digit numbers. The first two indicated the year. In this example, 06=1977. The following digits are between 100000 and 200000. Made In USA was also included on the transfer.I hope this clears up any confusion - thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "372581207127", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T22:00:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-27T22:00:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1977-Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-Tobacco-Sunburst-Electric-Guitar-w-OHSC-/372581207127", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Plainview, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3725812071278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MzI=/z/NRMAAOSwD1pcSQTn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTQ1WDE2MDA=/z/YbsAAOSwCWNcSQTk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAy/z/Jp0AAOSwaJ9cSQT8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTM=/z/WXMAAOSwqLRcSQTs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjA2/z/Kr0AAOSwZNtcSQTv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDQ5/z/zN8AAOSwFlJcSQTy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzA2/z/r74AAOSwWrNcSQT2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY5WDE2MDA=/z/0A8AAOSwyn1cSQT4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MDg=/z/Ug0AAOSwLeFcSQT-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~RkAAOSw8kRcSQUB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzgxWDE2MDA=/z/lnMAAOSwk-1cSQUE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11803", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wolfnsx", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2067, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 46, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 540}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1977 Gibson Les Paul Standard Tobacco Sunburst Electric Guitar w/ OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1977"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Tobacco Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "California Prop 65 Warning", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1977"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 1472, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=3227610", "StoreName": "Tagmasters"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
