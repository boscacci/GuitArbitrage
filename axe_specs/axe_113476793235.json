Item Description Jeff Ling handles the lead guitar duties for Australian metalcore kings Parkway Drive, and his Signature Series JL-600 takes the speed demon vibe of the ESP M Series to a whole new level. It offers neck-thru-body construction at 25.5&rdquo; scale for excellent sustain and smooth, fast access to the higher frets, made even speedier with a satin-finished, unpainted, extra thin U-shaped three-piece maple neck. The JK-600 has a comfortable and resonant alder body and a Macassar ebony fingerboard with glow-in-the-dark side markers, a special &ldquo;PWD&rdquo; inlay at the 12th fret, and 24 extra-jumbo frets for two full octaves of rock. Jeff had us include a set of EMG Metalworks 60 (neck) and 81 (bridge) pickups for all the tones you need from creamy rhythms to screaming leads, and the JL-600 also includes a TonePros locking TOM bridge with string-thru-body design and LTD locking tuners.
