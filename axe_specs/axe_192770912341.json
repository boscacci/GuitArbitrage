{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I believe this is the very sought after Austin 786 model. It was advertised as the 786 model when I bought it but there are no readily identifiable markings. When searched on the net the images match up with the 786\u2019s. It has excellent action, no fret buzz, a fast neck, sweet sounding pup\u2019s and the frets are in great shape. The guitar looks beautiful, plays beautifully, is not a Les Paul but for the money can not be beat. It also has a set neck as opposed to a bolt on. It has cream binding along with gold hardware. Cosmetically is 8.5 to 9 out of 10 with a couple of light scratches on the back side that are difficult to see and more difficult to photograph and some light fading on some of the gold hardware. There is a little mark on the headstock you can see in picture number 8. Other than that just standard play wear. This is for someone that wants a quality instrument to play but is not stuck on a more famous brand name. Plays beautifully with excellent sustain. Welcome to make an offer. Please ask if you have any questions before placing a bid. I will try to get back with you ASAP. I have a 100% rating, check out my feedback. I only accept PayPal and ship only CONUS.", "ItemID": "192770912341", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T23:30:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-26T06:08:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Austin-Guitar-LP-Style-/192770912341", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Carrollton, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927709123418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/ewgAAOSwjlVcFFG0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/-IgAAOSwQH5cFFG7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/T3QAAOSw4m9cFFGy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/bCkAAOSwfvtcFFG2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/48IAAOSwmE5cFFG4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/NCQAAOSwcnZcFFGv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk0/z/RK0AAOSwdhdcFFG5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/Y2QAAOSwdHpcFFJD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "75007", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thekidforreal", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 23}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Austin Guitar LP Style", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Austin"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 76, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 177.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
