{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a beautiful left handed 1987 Fender Squier E series Stratocaster made in Japan. These guitars rival some USA and Mexico guitars I\u2019ve played and owned. The neck feels amazing and the action is nice and low. Rosewood Fretboard was recently oiled and frets have a ton of life left. No finger indentations. The neck really is unbelievable. The guitar is all original and sounds fantastic. The guitar is aged white/cream color and has aged very nicely. The guitar is set up for a right handed with the nut being reversed so low E string is at the bottom. The guitar can come strung or unstrung depending on if you prefer to keep it right handed or switch the nut to play left handed. The left handed squier guitars from this year did not say \u201cmade in Japan\u201d or \u201cStratocaster\u201d on them. This is factory original and no decals have been removed. There are a few very small and minimal dents and scratches. The body where the neck connects to the body has 2 pressure cracks running from each side, which is very common for guitars in this vintage and do not affect the guitars playability or sound whatsoever. Honestly one of the best MIJ Squiers I have ever played. I own this exact guitar but a 1986 Fender Strat Japan, and this one honestly feels and plays better. The guitar is sold As-Is and returns are not accepted as this guitar is vintage and parts are easily removed, swapped or replaced. Please bid with confidence. I have photographed and described the guitar to the best of my ability. Happy bidding!", "ItemID": "143048258422", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T17:54:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-11T17:54:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Stunning-MIJ-1987-Fender-Squier-E-Series-Stratocaster-Left-Handed-/143048258422", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Santa Clarita, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430482584228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3VIAAOSwvfpcD~XQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UrUAAOSwpLdcD~XS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TiMAAOSwSe5cD~XU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/caMAAOSwQwFcD~XT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IfsAAOSw4m9cD~XY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mZQAAOSwEp5cD~Xa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EqoAAOSwAopcD~Xb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uVoAAOSw84ZcD~XW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PYsAAOSwmXpcD~XX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cXYAAOSwENVcD~Xd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ez8AAOSw9lBcD~Xe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91390", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "janewalch", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 21, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 19, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 340.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 340.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Stunning MIJ 1987 Fender Squier E Series Stratocaster Left Handed", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1987"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 287, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 345.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
