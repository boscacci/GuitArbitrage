{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Welcome to our Auction! You are looking at a Gretsch Electromatic Electric Guitar Black with Case!This is a very nice instrument with many tonal possibilities. PLEASE READ: We are selling it at a lower price because the truss rod nut is stripped. In other words, where the allen key goes to turn it has been stripped by a previous owner. So there is some relief in the neck that you could possibly lessen with lighter strings. We have lowered the bridge already to compensate for this.Overall condition is Very Good and other than the truss rod thing, you can expect to find a clean instrument.We believe you will be happy with your purchase and hopefully enjoy your new toy for many years to come! When you buy from me, expect to receive what you see in the pics. I know the feeling of buying something sight unseen only to find out the seller was not that accurate. I have been selling on Ebay for more than a decade and I am only happy when you are happy! Buyer has 24 hours to contact me and 3 days to complete payment transaction. If this criteria is not met, the item will be sold to someone else. Please keep in mind with shipping, when you buy a guitar from me, you are not just paying for shipping. You are paying for my time and experience in packaging delicate items, as well as the cost of new boxes and shipping peanuts. Thanks. Please email me with any questions and good luck in bidding! International Buyers are responsible for paying all duties and taxes. If you are not sure about how much they will be, please contact your local customs office and find out before you make a purchase, thank you!", "ItemID": "223296997381", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T02:05:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T12:35:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gretsch-Electromatic-Electric-Guitar-Black-Case-/223296997381", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pompano Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232969973818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5E0AAOSwfvtcB0Gf/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HGMAAOSwc6ZcB0Gg/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VQsAAOSwzd9cB0Gh/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U-AAAOSwcDdcB0Gk/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GD4AAOSwh39cB0Gk/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VpgAAOSwJtJcB0Gm/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ejAAAOSwrQxcB0Go/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8kgAAOSwtcRcB0Gr/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33065", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spinesplitter", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1613, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 725}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gretsch Electromatic Electric Guitar Black with Case!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 85, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=11691455", "StoreName": "Hear For Music"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
