{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx, no PO Boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Most deliveries will require a signature. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone Les Paul Junior with some nice upgrades. Guitar is in great condition,has a pin head size nick on the back edge,otherwise very mild surface scratches.The front of this guitar has some nice flame to it. I also upgraded the tuners to some nice vintage looking Kluson style tuners,you can see the screw holes left from the old closed back tuners on the back of the headstock. The neck looks great, zero fret wear. I replaced the stock pickup with a nice Humbucker size P90 pickup. Next I upgraded the tone capacitor with a Soviet military surplus paper in oil capacitor. Sometimes I change the caps and I don't hear a big difference,this time the change was quite noticable. Sounded very full on clean tones and has a nice super nasty growl once you add some gain. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. A classy looking guitar that wants to kick some butt. Please study the pictures to get a better idea of the condition. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
