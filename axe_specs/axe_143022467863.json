{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The G&L ASAT Classic Bluesboy is a factory-modded version of Leo's final word on the traditional single-cutaway bolt-on guitar, and the semi-hollow version takes it further with G&L's distinctive twin voice chambers and f-hole added to a beautiful swamp ash body. Like its solid-body stablemate, this axe delivers a well-balanced pairing of a G&L alnico humbucker designed by Paul Gagon and a single-coil G&L Magnetic Field Design bridge pickup designed by Leo Fender. Framed in a classic boxed-steel bridge, the single-coil MFD bridge pickup delivers crisp attack with complex harmonics while individual brass saddles offer modern levels of intonation refinement. Flip to the neck \u02dcbucker and you'll discover all the charismatic warmth you could ask for. Put \u02dcem together and you'll find yourself immersed in exploring the limits of this guitar's surprising versatility. What's more, the semi-hollow body softens the midrange attack, accentuating the low and high harmonics.", "ItemID": "143022467863", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T17:29:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-21T17:29:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-L-Tribute-ASAT-Classic-Bluesboy-Semi-Hollow-Electric-Guitar-Telecaster-body-/143022467863", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pico Rivera, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430224678638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/DzAAAOSwAuJb9ZTp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90660", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "the*a*man", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 267, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 255.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 255.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2042}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G&L Tribute ASAT Classic Bluesboy Semi-Hollow Electric Guitar (Telecaster body)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ASAT Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Beige"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 377, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 260.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar was hardly used, and has very minimal wear on it.
