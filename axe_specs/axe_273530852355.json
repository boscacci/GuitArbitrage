{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello All! Today I have for you a 2013 USA Deluxe Strat with all the good stuff. I swapped out the stock pickup set for a special order DG20 gilmour black set which came with a black pickguard. I prefer the black set over the common pearloid and cream which matches well with the sunburst finish. The pickguard has the usual pick scratches you would expect from a black pickguard. I replaced the knobs with brownface style black knobs (inspired by That Pedal Show) though I will include the original knobs that came with the set. I also just added a brand new matching Fender trem cavity cover today as I am listing it. Cosmetically, the finish is in nice shape and can only see slight surface scratches up close which even using the flash on my camera I couldn't pick up. The body has nice grain and is billed as \"select alder\" which the total weight clocks in at a nice 8 lbs with the pop in trem arm. It's about as clean as a 4-5 year old strat could possibly be. The serial number indicates 2013 though it received the 60th anniversary strat badge so it must've been a late December early January model as 2014 was the year for those badges. The original deluxe case has some scratches on the outside and comes with the original key. The original case candy is included as well! As a super duper BONUS, I will include a vintage BOSS MIJ CS2. What would a David Gilmour strat be without some compression and it may as well be what is regarded as one of the best ever made. It's pretty clean too compared to others I've had. Thank you for looking!", "ItemID": "273530852355", "EndTime": "2018-11-04T21:04:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-28T21:04:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2013-Fender-American-Stratocaster-Deluxe-3TSB-EMG-DG20-BONUS-VINTAGE-BOSS-CS2-/273530852355", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Phoenix, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735308523558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4N1g3MDM=/z/9AUAAOSw989b1h6S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg2ODY=/z/ItMAAOSwabRb1iCd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NDE=/z/UXUAAOSwELBb1iCu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZbwAAOSwucNb1h--/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODQ=/z/97YAAOSw989b1iDJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg5NTY=/z/5CkAAOSwcXpb1iDd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ggoAAOSwN5hb1iAf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H4sAAOSwRBVb1iBB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TBEAAOSwySZb1iBM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HmAAAOSws~pb1iBe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Dq0AAOSwPjhb1iGJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/u1EAAOSwPDVb1iGb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "85027", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "26602914", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 36, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 268}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2013 Fender American Stratocaster Deluxe 3TSB EMG DG20 *BONUS VINTAGE BOSS CS2*", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Delux"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 146, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 910.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
