Get your hands on it, and you will be too. PRS-designed 85/15 S humbucking pickups The two humbucking pickups in this SE Custom 22 are Paul Reed Smith-designed 85/15 S humbuckers. An update on PRS's original humbuckers, the 85/15 S pickups are designed to be a fantastic choice for a wide variety of music and playing styles. They offer you plenty of output for driving your amp hard, while sounding clear and detailed when you want. These SE humbucker closely resemble the tones of the U.S.-made versions found in the solidbody electric guitars crafted at PRS's Maryland factory. Mahogany topped with maple looks and sounds amazing To give this PRS SE Custom 22 solidbody electric guitar a rich yet balanced sound, PRS began by choosing the tried-and-true combination of mahogany topped with maple. This instrument's mahogany body offers natural tonal warmth, which is offset perfectly by the brighter tone of its maple top. These tonewoods join forces with the guitar's 85/15 S pickups to deliver a balance of depth, snap, and great midrange projection that propel you through the mix. PRS Wide Thin profile neck feels right at home Wrap your hand around the SE Custom 22's Wide Thin profile neck and you'll understand why it has been a favorite among guitarists in every genre for years. Because it's where your hands meet the instrument, neck shapes are critical to your playing experience. Paul Reed Smith takes this into very careful consideration when designing all of their neck profiles. The Wide Thin neck carve is very comfortable for players desiring a faster feel than the Wide Fat, while maintaining plenty of wood for optimal sustain.
