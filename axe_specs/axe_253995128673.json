The maple/rosewood neck is has had a very nice headstock makeover with many coats of clear over the decal. Near zero fret wear . Whole guitar features black hardware. The bridge is a modern string through the body six saddle bridge. The very cool Gloss Sunburst body is in excellent condition, just mild surface scratches. The pickups are a Chrome colored P90's with hum cancelling in the middle position. I also upgraded the tone capacitor with a nice axial film capacitor. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. These pickups sound very good on this guitar.
