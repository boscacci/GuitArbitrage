{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Mint Condition John Lennon Limited Edition Epiphone Casino number 426 of 1965This Casino was purchased and then vaulted as an investment. It has been played no more than 10 times, and the finish reflects this. No scratches, and the only imperfection is a small (5cm) nick on the back of the headstock near the G tuner. You can see this in the photo, but no one will notice it while you are playing. If you've always wanted a US version of John Lennon's guitar, but missed out when this was released, here's your chance to get it as clean as when it left the Gibson Kalamazoo shop.The nitro cellulose finish has never once touched the foam rubber of a guitar stand, and has been kept in it's case full time. The fretwear is minimal.All case candy I received is included, along with the pick that usually is long gone.Any questions please ask! I've swapped by Casino for a Rickenbacker 4001, and am playing bass full time now. Make this your dream guitar!Shipping is a flat $100 to anywhere in the Continental US. This includes tracking and full insurance.An Exacting reproduction of the 1960's original made in the Gibson Kalamazoo, Michigan Shop.The Epiphone John Lennon 1965 Casino Electric Guitar has a heritage as fascinating as the man whose name it bears. In 1966, during the recording of Revolver, John Lennon and George Harrison acquired sunburst Epiphone Casino guitars. John was taken by his new guitar and made it his main axe from that point on, using several different versions over the ensuing years. In cooperation with Yoko Ono, Epiphone introduces 2 Limited Edition Lennon Casino guitars. The '65 Casino is a reproduction of the original guitar John purchased with its sunburst finish and stock hardware. In 1968, John had his Casino sanded down to bare wood and finished with a thin, dull coat of lacquer. He first used this \"natural\" Casino in \"The White Album\" sessions of '68. The John Lennon Revolution Casino is a reproduction of this stripped guitar as it remains today, featuring one coat of lacquer, gold Grover tuners, and the pickguard removed. A combined total of 1,965 of these individually hand-numbered, historic guitars have been produced, and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of each goes to the BMI Foundation for the John Lennon Scholarship Fund which supports music education. Limited lifetime warranty. Epiphone includes a hardshell case with the '65 John Lennon Casino Electric Guitar.
