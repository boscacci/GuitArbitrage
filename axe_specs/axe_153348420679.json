{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2001 Gibson Les Paul Studio Limited Edition Color Metallic Blue w/ Hardshell Case This guitar is pre-owned in used condition. We purchased this guitar second hand with the purpose of re sell. **PLEASE READ AUCTION CAREFULLY** This guitar is in used cosmetic condition with obvious signs of wear and tear. FOR STARTERS THE STRING MUST BE REPLACED- THERE WONT BE ANY INCLUDED IN THE AUCTION. The back plate has scratch marks; some marks are deeper than the others. The top back plate is slightly pushed in (or screwed on too tight). There are also marks that resemble dents on the front of the guitar. When checking the neck you can see there are some light rust marks where the old strings used to sit. At the very top you can notice there are some small chips where the finish is gone. THERE ARE KNICKS/SCRATCHES/MARKS/DUST/ETC THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GUITAR *LONG STORY SHORT, THIS GUITAR COULD REALLY USE SOME TLC AND AN OWNER WHO CAN BRING HER BACK TO LIFE* NOW THE GOOD NEWS... There are absolutely no cracks in the neck, the neck is straight and the pick ups will be included so you can re attach them when you attach the new strings. PLEASE VIEW ALL THE PHOTOS!
