Nice action & good tone.Original softshell case included.Super Rare Bass. The only bass model made by Guyatone for Orpheum in the 57' to 62' release period. This is between 59' and 60'. Guyatone made 5 guitars and one bass guitar model in those 5 years, and I can't find any other bass like this anywhere. In that time period each of those models definitely have Guyatone pick-ups. Which sound pretty good. The best info I've found on this bass came from the Guyatone website's history section. Comes with original soft shell case.", "ItemID": "352565647008", "EndTime": "2019-01-17T15:45:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T15:45:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1959-Guyatone-Orpheum-Model-1202-Bass-Guitar-Sunburst-Great-Player-1-00-Start-/352565647008", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Dublin, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525656470088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/-DgAAOSwSMxcN7Fe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/IT4AAOSwEGBcN7Ff/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/SQ0AAOSw5wFcN7Fe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/fngAAOSwckVcN7Fe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/~tIAAOSwgrZcN7Fe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/RAsAAOSws~pcN7Fe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/edsAAOSwa3lcN7Fe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/n-AAAOSwJ7RcN7Fe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "24084", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aleea-79", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 31, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 221.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 221.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 223}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1959 Guyatone/Orpheum Model 1202 Bass Guitar Sunburst Great Player 1.00 Start", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Guyatone"]}]}, "HitCount": 134, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 224.01, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
