{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Melancon P90 Artist with f-hole option up for auction. I purchased this guitar in 2007 and I am the original owner. The guitar is in mint condition and has never left my pet-free and smoke-free home studio. I have only used this guitar at home, never for gigs. If you are looking at this listing, you likely know already how amazing a builder Gerard Melancon is. This guitar is a wonderful example of his work -- flawless in every way. The winner of this auction will be very happy with this instrument. The fretboard and pickup covers are made from Snakewood; it is a gorgeous wood that is not seen every often, and the photos do not do it justice. Truly beautiful in person. Comes with original G&G case (shown in first photo). Thank you for looking and happy bidding!", "ItemID": "123583057498", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T01:00:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T01:00:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Melancon-P90-Artist-guitar-f-hole-option-/123583057498", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Oberlin, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235830574988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FQYAAOSwrZBcMqN-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DlwAAOSweiFcMqOC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Vl0AAOSw-9NcMqOH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DpQAAOSwwqVcMqOK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QzsAAOSwEp5cMqOO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-UoAAOSwOShcMqOR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/czMAAOSwikBcMqOV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WNAAAOSwaiBcMqOY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GY0AAOSw~sdcMqOc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "44074", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ben_jones", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 179, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1676.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1676.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 356}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Melancon P90 Artist guitar with f-hole option", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["melancon"]}]}, "HitCount": 148, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1701.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
