{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction is an absolutely amazing and very rare 1979-1980 vintage Gibson Les Paul Custom SilverBurst! Comes in a newer hardshell case. Beautiful Silverburst finish - not yellowed much like most of these are. This is a discontinued model with a solid body so the tone is thick with singing sustain, a real Ebony fretboard \u2013 tight and bouncy (no longer available from Gibson and rapidly becoming obsolete). Featuring 'PAT NO' t-top pickups for that smooth vintage tone!~~ Original 1979 dated pots, original bridge and tail-piece, original knobs, 'Gibson' tuners, etc. This guitar is in FANTASTIC cosmetic condition - very CLEAN! Showing only minor finish wear such as some light buckle worming on back. No breaks or cracks. Ebony fretboard is in fantastic condition. Original frets still have most of their life left. Neck is perfect and has a fast 60s tapered profile which is not too thin - just right! Super nice action and AMAZING playability! The tone of this guitar is heaven on earth! Compared to other Gibsons, the Silverburst is louder and has a richer tone. Beautiful cleans for blues/jazz/country. Awesome distortion for hard rock, metal and classic rock. It seems to have more bass than other Les Paul's, and it seems to be more 'heavy' with clear tones. SUSTAIN is incredible!
