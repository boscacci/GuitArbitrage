{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2004 Gibson Les Paul Custom Shop Historic 1959 '59 Reissue EXC From the 2006 Gibson Custom Shop \"ROADWORN\" charity auction, 2004 Les Paul Historic 1959 R9 Custom Shop Faded Cherry Sunburst Reissue #9 47xx.

Authentically figured Eastern Maple top with cherry sunburst finish and desirable Madagascar Rosewood fretboard. Madagascar Rosewood is now listed on both the CITES Appendix II and IUCN Red List.

Near mint condition with only the slightest sign of handling. Essentially unplayed from a private collection. Fresh setup including intonation, medium action with 10-46 gauge nickel round wound strings. Nut slot is evenly spaced and probably not quite slotted deeply enough, but the new owner can have it final slotted to preference. Neck is straight. No fretwear or playability issues. The Lifton reissue case is also in like new condition inside and out and includes the lock key. This guitar has alot of sustain and note bloom. This one is a player's dream; it has \"the\" tone.
