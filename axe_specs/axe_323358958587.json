{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "We are offering a VERY limited edition Dean Guitar, produced in the 1980\u2019s. This listing is for one guitar only (the Budweiser) guitar is being offered in a separate listing. Neil Young recently announced that he is selling off a number of items from his personal collection, Trains, Cars, and guitars! One of the guitars he is selling is his Budweiser Dean guitar. It\u2019s said that Neil partly got the idea for his song \u201cThis Note\u2019s For You\u201d from this guitar! Now that\u2019s pretty cool! The neck is straight, the tuners are tight like new. Guitar Dean Busch:The Dean Busch guitar was released around the same time as the Budweiser guitar. Being a less popular beer, the guitar was produced in even smaller quantities than the \u201cBud\u201d version. Very rare indeed. Condition: There are a few marks here and there, but nothing distracting. See photos for close ups. The neck is straight, the tuners are tight like new. This guitar should be set up before playing. There is no hard shell case for the Busch guitar and I have NEVER seen one. It does come with the original DEAN cardboard box, which it has always been stored in. Over all in excellent condition. I\u2019ve kept this guitar stored for years in its case in a tempeture controlled atmosphere. More photos can be available upon request for serious buyers.
