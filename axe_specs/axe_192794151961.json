{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is in excellent condition. There are a few light scratches on the body on the back of the guitar. They are hard to see unless you look in the light. I took pictures but they do not show in the pictures. The neck has a 24 fret ebony fingerboard. I added roman numeral DECALS on the neck to go with the appearance. You can scrape them off if you choose. The guitar actually does not have position markers with the exception of a symbol that covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th frets. The guitar also has dual EMG 81 pickups in both the bridge and neck positions. Strap locks are included but not the actual strap. There is nothing wrong with the guitar. I actually hate to sell it, but I also need to trim my collection. The guitar does not include a case, and I will nor ship overseas. Thanks for looking.", "ItemID": "192794151961", "EndTime": "2019-01-20T18:09:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-17T15:55:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-M-Vampire-Bio-Tech-Strat-Style-Electric-Graphic-Guitar-2013-/192794151961", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Scranton, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927941519618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cosAAOSwVXdb9s0J/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mSEAAOSwctJb9s0o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VaAAAOSwM6Fb9s0q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XAMAAOSwkHxb9s0r/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "18512", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rakas04", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 279, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 370.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 370.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 86}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP LTD M Vampire Bio Tech Strat Style Electric Graphic Guitar 2013", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}]}, "HitCount": 37, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
