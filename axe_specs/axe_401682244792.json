{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a wonderful and loud sounding rare 'Marwin Super' Arch Top acoustic guitar made by Harmony guitar company for 'KAY' Guitars between 1935 - 1940. Marwin models were made only between these years. This guitar has a tobacco burst finish with faux flames sides and back with a tight grained Solid Spruce Top. The top has a very fine mill fabric on thee entire surface and the back too has strips of heavy cloth to put off cracking. There is an old repaired crack on the back with 2 cleats that appear to be done very well. 25 1/2\" scale. Upper bout measures 11 3/8\", waist measures 9 1/2\" and the lower bout measures 16 1/4\", all approximate. The neck is unadjustabe but in very good straight condition with slight relief (see pics) as to play very well with low action and there is a lot of adjustability in the beautiful boned saddle bridge. It has real bone on the bridge saddle very unique and a real bone nut. The sound on this arch top is unbelievable. I've had other old arch tops in the past and this one is by far incredible for the sound. Many people who have played it says its like an electric plugged in. Because of the bone nut and boned bridge they say when you tap on the bridge it sounds like tapping on an electric pickup, very resonant. The neck joint is solid and secure/well built guitar. My daughter has a 1908 Larson Brothers Mandolin and it has thee exact same purfling that this guitar has, via Chicago built back then I believe. The top & bottom are both stamped with the number 2655H1459. Looks to have thee original tuners but I believe the pick guard has been replaced. The pick guard side bracket is very rough but solid (see picks). The finger bourd appears to have been surfaced and new jumbo frets installed previously and I believe that's why it has a good action and plays sweet and fast. I tried to adjust the bridge down closer but got string buzz so I adjusted it to where there is about 5/32 at the 12th fret(Pretty darn good in my book). I had a brand new jumbo arch top case modified to hold this guitar properly (see pics). Please ask any questions you may have before bidding and or purchasing.
