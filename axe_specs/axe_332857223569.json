{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Custom Area Zero Fender/Squier Stratocaster - Walnut Custom Area Zero Stratocaster (Fender and Squier parts) This was a custom project that manily only used the original basswood body and neck from a Fender Squire Strat. The body and neck were stained dark walnut. The nut was changed out to bone. The fretboard was given an ebony nitro cellulose thin laquer. The tuners were changed out to higher quality tuners. the saddles were replaced with fender saddles. And all the electronics were swapped out and pickups were upgraded. A lot of work went into this beauty and she plays great to show it! There are some knicks and imperfections on the finish as the pictures show. The original bridge on the body was installed slightly askew even though I swapped out the bridge for a better quality one one can see from the picture its not perfectly straight. This is only cosmetic however and does not affect playability. The hardware upgrades were birdge, tuners, pickups, switchplate, electronics, strap buttons, string trees, nut, volume/tone buttons, and tuning machines. The original holes from hardware swap outs are filled in as you can see from the pictures. This is your change to own a great looking custom guitar for a great bargain!
