{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ibanez RG7421, modified with a white Seymour Duncan Sentient & Nazgul set, a \"blow switch\" and pearloid tuner buttons. For those that don't know the blow switch, when in the on position, bypasses all the other controls and sends the signal from the bridge pickup straight to the output jack. Not only is it convenient, but not running through anything else opens up the Nazgul and makes it sound even better. I also had the fretboard edges rolled, the neck feels and plays great now. All work was done by a professional luthier. This is a really great guitar, none of the normal Indonesian made Ibanez issues. There's no nicks, scratches, dings dents etc. anywhere on it. I'm just not playing 7 strings anymore and have too many guitars so it's got to go.", "ItemID": "233107614785", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T13:59:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T13:59:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-RG7421-7-String-Electric-Guitar-W-Seymour-Duncan-Sentient-Nazgul-/233107614785", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Centreville, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331076147858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDUwWDgwMA==/z/ZZgAAOSwEVlcScOc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/B6MAAOSwiKdcSkOS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gAYAAOSwSfJcSkOY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yqsAAOSwQ5pcSkOm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UAMAAOSwPWtcSkOu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "21617", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "killswitch-wylde", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 258, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 14}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez RG7421 7 String Electric Guitar W/Seymour Duncan Sentient & Nazgul", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ibanez RG"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 358, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
