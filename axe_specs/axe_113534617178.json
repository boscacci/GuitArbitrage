Sustains...Wide strap included plus soft case. Check out my other auctions also.Happy Bidding! Start me up!! No; This is Not Kieth\u2019s guitar. - But definitely inspired by it. I bought this on EBay exactly as is shown,10 or so years ago. I don\u2019t smoke nor burn my guitars. The distressed look is an affectation. Street cred for a Street fighting man... No, you can\u2019t always get what you want - But you can try sometimes... ;) P. S. Has push/pull vol knob to tap humbucker to single coil with 3 way switch. As on many Fenders, the electronics can use some cleaning up. Needs a good capable tech. Pots can get scratchy. I don\u2019t play it enough to be bothered. Sold As is. It\u2019s how I got it too. Here\u2019s some G.A.S. Porn: The Fender Japan reissue of Keith Richard's \"Sonny\" is an incredibly rare instrument. Mostly known for his blonde 1953 Fender Telecaster, this was the other famous Keith Tele that does not get talked about much (maybe due to the fact Fender USA never reissued it?). Named the TL67-65SPL, these guitars used a nice heavy Asian Ash (Sen) body with a nice 67 type Maple D-shape neck, gold bridge and Japanese made Gotoh style tuners. Spec sheets would indicate a 324mm Scale, 7.5\" radius fretboard, 21 Vintage frets, 42mm nut width. The perfect guitar for a Keith fan or a modern player looking for a hard hitting humbucker filled tele! The neck is dead straight, truss rod fine and plenty of life left in the frets. Structurally and electrically sound. No issues at all. No breaks, repairs and is obviously factory routed for the humbucker. It is in superb condition for the age. Like all of these mid 80's White Ash 52's, it\u2019s a hefty old lump and weighs in at 4.7kg. But what a great playing Tele, great action & the pickups are both outstanding and work well together.
