You are looking at a Vintage 1966 Baldwin Burns Vibraslim Semi-Hollow Body Guitar. Originally designed and built in England by Jim Burns a visionary guitar builder that was one of the very first boutique guitar manufacturers. It is said that while Leo Fender concentrated on mass production, Jim Burns was more of an artist hand building his line of guitars. He sold the Burns company to the Baldwin Piano company and it was renamed Baldwin Burns with Jim Burns staying on as a designer/consultant. The Vibraslim is a beautiful guitar. Based on a Gibson 335, it is a beautiful thinline semi-hollowbody guitar. This beauty has the scroll headstock and is armed with two Burns-Designed pickups and controls, Mahogany C-Profile & Rosewood Fingerboard. Tremolo Bridge with Trem Bar. If you are looking for an affordable vintage guitar and you like the sound of a Semi-Hollow, you can get a AWESOME guitar for just a fraction of what a Gibson 335 would cost you. Whether your into Blues, Rock, Country or Jazz this Baldwin will get the job done. Our luthier did a complete setup. Everything Functions and works correctly. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Nut Width: 1.62\" Weight: 6.55 lbs. Complete Package with Hard Shell Case Included! Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. Cosmetics: Good Condition. The main issue is there are a couple of holes that have been filled with wooden dowel plugs. They are both near the input jack. The first one is on the back of the guitar near the edge of the lower bout. (See picture #11). The second one is right next to the input jack. (See picture #12). There are some light strumming scratches on the pickguard. There are cosmetic Lacquer cracks running vertically on both sides also. They are cosmetic only. NOT Structural. Lacquer checking is also on both sides. Wherever there is wood you will find the checking. Neck and fretboard in good shape. Lots of street cred. Very Authentic. Dripping with \"Mojo\". It is used. Not perfect. Good Condition. Overall, a really nice guitar. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story.
