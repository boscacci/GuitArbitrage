{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I got this with only the body/neck and pickups. Serial number 86756. I would assume this is a late 60's. All other parts are non original. That would be tone/ volume pots, knobs, tuners, pickgaurd, bridge and tailpeice, strap buttons.The original 1/4\" input jack was intact with the body. The route for the Burns vibrato is covered by the tailpiece. It plays nicely up and down the neck. It sounds like a Gretcsh. I know because I have owned a few and the Hilo Tron pickups sound as they should and wired to original Corvette schematic. The headstock appears to have been painted over as evidenced by the Gretsch decal area. View photo. After close examination there is no repair in that area and no neck repairs but it does have cracks in the finish and chips. Neck joint is solid and the neck is straight and not twisted.Please view photos carefully and ask questions. All work was done by a professional lutherer not a do it yourself job. Not a collector's item but a nice player. This is being relisted as a result of not being able to complete the transaction with buyer. Please be serious if you intend to buy it.", "ItemID": "173691288458", "EndTime": "2019-01-15T00:22:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T15:52:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Gretsch-6135-Corvette-/173691288458", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Gates, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736912884588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/oGcAAOSw-HRcCq9T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/ntMAAOSwVEFcCq~U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/nPsAAOSwNYtcCrBe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/GSwAAOSwZupcCrCC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/pLYAAOSwsDZcCrDC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/vsAAAOSwC9hcCrDp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/vmsAAOSwrZBcCrEP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/TVoAAOSw8MxcCrE9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/1UUAAOSwq6VcCrGK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/CMoAAOSwkelcCrGk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/6RgAAOSwFURcCrH0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/6YkAAOSwFURcCrIf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "97346", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "clazarus", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1202, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 775.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 775.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***-", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Gretsch 6135 Corvette", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 677, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
