{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Overview:For sale is a like-new, custom-made Ernie Ball Music Man Luke 2 in Candy Red; one of 35 examples worldwide delivered to original owner in 2009. It comes with an all-rosewood handle, EMG-85 humbucker bridge and EMG custom SLV single-coils in the middle and neck. The guitar comes with all original accessories shown in the photos, and the guitar was almost never played except on rare occasions for family or friends. An additional Vox adaptor and tuner are included with the original box. As a Ball Family Reserve edition ordered in October of 2008, this guitar was purchased as a collector's piece and has no blemishes or defects of any kind. Because of a moving schedule and lack of space, this guitar is being sold without reserve to a new owner who will appreciate the instrument. I will ship via USPS Priority, or if you're in the San Diego area, I can arrange for a pickup. Happy Bidding!
