Using the Custom 24 as a platform, this guitar adds a low-B string to offer increased versatility to the player who wants more tonal range. Whether you're playing rock, jazz, or metal, this guitar provides extended low-end growl, increased chordal variance, and a greater ability to embellish standard chords.The SE 7-String features a beveled maple top with flame maple veneer and mahogany back, a 24-fret, 25\" scale length maple neck with rosewood fretboard and bird inlays. The electronics package pairs SE HFS and SE Vintage Bass pickups with a volume, push/pull tone, and 3-way blade switch. The SE HFS and SE Vintage pickups were designed to mirror the Maryland-made pickups of the same name (used on the Custom since 1991). Originally meaning Hot, Fat, and Screams, the HFS was the evolution of the original Standard treble pickup. The HFS is a powerful pickup with a balance of aggression, clear highs, strong mid-range, and strong bass. Likewise, the Vintage bass is the evolution of the original Standard bass pickup and has a warm high-mid sound that is excellent for many musical styles.SE Custom 24 7-String Model SpecsBodyTop WoodBeveled Maple Top with Flame Maple VeneerBack WoodMahoganyNeckNumber of Frets24Scale Length25\"Neck WoodMapleFretboard WoodRosewoodNeck ShapeWide ThinFretboard InlaysBirdsHardware/ElectronicsBridgePlate-Style, String-Thru-Body BridgeTunersPRS Designed TunersHardware TypeNickelTreble PickupSE HFSBass PickupSE Vintage BassPickup SwitchingVolume, Push/Pull Tone, 3-Way Blade Switch", "ItemID": "273671448781", "EndTime": "2019-01-29T22:23:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T22:45:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-SE-Sunburst-Flame-Top-7-String-Electric-Guitar-Gig-Bag-/273671448781", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Huntsville, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736714487818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FS4AAOSwPGtcQ6hU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/53QAAOSw-FRcQ6hW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2OoAAOSwe7ZcQ6hY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GVIAAOSwmFxcQ6hZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jqQAAOSwcf9cQ6hb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x0UAAOSw~2VcQ6hc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1KwAAOSwJtJcQ6hd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "35801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "1957xlsp", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 408, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 65}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS SE Sunburst Flame Top 7-String Electric Guitar (Gig Bag)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["7BC"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 121, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
