{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "VNice Original Ibanez SA320FM Purple Flame Electric w Bag ser# W751312, made in Korea. Those of you who have played them know how incredible these little beasts are :-)) Ibanez matches one of the lightest and thinnest bodies to an ultra thin ( wizard ) neck, pops in great sounding pickups and straps a temelo on for good measure. Ours is used but as the pics show, it is sweet !! Finished in a rich purple stain flame top with matching head stock veneer and cool brown binding. This beauty has never been abused and has only light wear (surface scratches and tiny dings). Looks great from any angle. The neck is straight with low non buzz action and the frets are excellent. Just cleaned it and strung it with D\u2019Adario XL9\u2019s and it plays easy as can be. Electronics are clean. Looks to be all original except missing the tremelo bar. Includes the shown gig bag to keep it warm and happy :-)....
