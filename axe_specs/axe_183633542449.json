{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2004-2005 Fender Stratocaster MIM This is a great playing Fender Stratocaster. From the serial number, I believe it to be a 2004-2005. The pickups are the HSS configuration. This gives it great versatility. I believe it to be stock. It has a lot of character and just enough patina for a cool vibe. It has some dings and a few finish cracks that are common on the MIM models. I have tried to photograph them. It features a rosewood fingerboard. These will get harder to find and more expensive due to the CITES treaty issue. It has freshly polished frets. The first few frets have some minor dents that didn\u2019t photograph well. They do not interfere with playing. I will include a light gig bag that is not pictured. The back plate has the image of the original sticker that comes on the plastic cover. Shipping to lower 48 US states only please. Below is what Fender sent to me regarding this guitar: *MZ4137290/ 0134700580/ FEND STD FAT STRAT RW AWT/ 08-12-2004.
