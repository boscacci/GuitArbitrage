{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, an Eastwood Airline '59 Town & Country in exceptional condition and in perfect working order. An uncommon and discontinued reissue of the original Airline-branded model produced in the 1960s for Montgomery Ward, this Eastwood version is a clever modern spin on what made the original so visually and tonally unique. This guitar features a chambered mahogany body, bolt-on maple neck, and rosewood fingerboard for a wonderful combination of tone, sustain, and resonance. Acoustically, notes jump out of the guitar and the instrument has a cutting and rumbly voice. When plugged in, the Town & Country screams and sparkles with a classic sound thanks to the Alnico Hot-10 bridge humbucker and the Airline Vintage Voiced Single Coil (VVSC) pickups in the neck and middle positions. These humbucker-sized single-coils produce a resonant tone that is on the verge of hollow and microphonic for a time-machine type of experience and will go anywhere from glassy clean to punchy and in your face roar. This guitar responds exceptionally well to dirt and fuzz as well as carrying on the legacy of unique tone for which Airline Guitars are known. This Airline weighs a mere 7lbs 8oz and has been professionally setup with 10-46 strings and comfortable action. The maple neck has a big chunky C shaped profile with lots of shoulder and consistent depth as you travel up the fretboard. The jumbo fretwire shows virtually no wear, with lots of meat, well rounded crowns and clear, singing notes in every register. The scale length measures 25\" and the nut is a full 1 11/16\" in width. On the headstock, the original Kluson-style strip tuners turn smoothly and hold pitch well, and the raised \"Airline\" logo is present. The electronics all work as intended, with individual Volume and Tone knobs directly above each pickup, as well as a Master Volume knob and three-way pickup selector switch. The chrome hardware and plastic parts are all in great shape and the gloss Redburst finish has subtle top and back carve to accentuate the otherwise vaguely Les Paul-shaped body. Cosmetic wear is extremely limited, with only a few light scuffs in the clear coat on the body, while the neck profile is free of wear.The Eastwood-branded hardshell case is included.
