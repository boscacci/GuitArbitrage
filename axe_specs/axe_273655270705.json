{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Vintage 1967 swept Wing is a very rare collectors guitar. For a serious guitar collector it is a fantastic one of a kind, art decco from the 1960's. Joe Hall from Bakersfield Ca. worked for Semie Mosley at Moserite factory. Learned how to craft guitars and later struck out on his own, in 1966-67 crafted his swept wing guitars ............maybe 40 of them. But sadly went bust in 1968.Today if you could find one well good luck!!!!!The electronic componets are the best of the best being the highest quality in 1966-67. You guitar players all know from the pickup wire to the pots are superior to todays crappy cheap componets. OK it has a two piece maple old growth neck, Alder body old growth. The neck has a unique zero fret at the nut. The pickups are hand made stereo and the tones are really beautiful from that surf sound to country and yes rock. The neck is super straight, frets are like new has a brazilian rose wood fb very rare! This guitar plays and isn't wall candy!", "ItemID": "273655270705", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T23:59:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-13T19:32:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1967-Vintage-Hallmark-Swept-Wing-guitar-collectors-dream-/273655270705", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Shafter, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736552707058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/S9sAAOSwhEhcO4y9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aBwAAOSwY4JcO4zO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mMAAAOSwcttcO4za/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AwoAAOSwH2RcO4zk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HFQAAOSwb15cO4zx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Oi8AAOSwyTtcO40A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tCsAAOSw0TBcO40T/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/C44AAOSwa1hcO40d/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Eq0AAOSwQ5pcO401/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XN4AAOSwkjJcO41J/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JUcAAOSwNphcO41h/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/W0UAAOSwBPRcO42P/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "93263", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dintheden", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 24, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***6", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4596}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1967 Vintage Hallmark Swept Wing guitar collectors dream!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Hallmark"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Classic"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 101, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
