The bridge pickup has a brass bridge plate. These pickups sound incredible and offer vintage tone and a bridge pickup without the typical shrill that cheaper pickups have. This guitar has a great \"feel\", and the neck is very comfortable to play with a nice sanded back. Setup is nice and fast and frets look great with little to no wear. What you have here is the experience of a Fender custom shop guitar at a fraction of the price. Just a great guitar that's sure to please. Comes with a used vinyl gig bag.
