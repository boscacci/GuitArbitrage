{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a Gibson Les Paul Standard, 2010. Sadly I don't have the time to play it much, and I'd rather sell to someone who can enjoy it rather than watching it go unplayed. I've made a few modifications:- The tuners are Gibson certified vintage tuners- The middle pick-up has been reverse wound. I find it gives the setting a richer tone, and with both volume and tone knobs you can really experiment with the tone. I was inspired to do this by Peter Green's early blues work; if you've heard his playing, that's the tone you'll have reproduced using the middle pickup setting. The wiring can be undone and re-set to factory settings if desired.- Those two things aside, everything else is factory standard, U.S.A. made in Nashville. The headstock was repaired maybe eight years ago. The guitar originally belonged to my father, and one of his cats knocked it over, cracking the headstock. It was professionally repaired, and does not affect playability or tuning at all; the only effect is a barely-visible mark along the base of the headstock. Cosmetically, there is an additional small ding in the body, but other than that the guitar is in great condition. Includes hardcover Gibson case along with pick guard.", "ItemID": "322816164974", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T23:39:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2017-10-09T19:07:54.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Traditional-Electric-Guitar-/322816164974", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Brooklyn, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3228161649748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/29sAAOSwNglZ28iN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ID4AAOSwCmNZ28iL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d8oAAOSwCi9Z28iM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sH8AAOSwgiRZ28iK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eSQAAOSw6HJZ28iL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LWMAAOSwak5Z28iL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/E9oAAOSwjGpZ28iL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11215", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "caio.s.p.73", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 13, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 181}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Traditional Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["LPTDEBCH1", "LPTDLHSCH1"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["LPTDEBCH1"]}]}, "HitCount": 7454, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78642533", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
