The highly figured Flame Maple top gives the Tagliare Custom a look like no other.

This guitar is very comfortable with weight averaging 7.5 lbs.CANADIAN MAPLE NECK The Tagliare Custom features a full 22-fret maple neck with a rock hard maple 12\" radius fingerboard. The two-post floating tremolo system to allow for knife-edge accuracy and great tremolo action. Locking tuners as a standard feature, along with TUSQ nuts and string retainers, allow for maximum sustain and assure you stay in tune. SIGNATURE DZPL SINGLE COIL PICKUPS The Dean Zelinsky Private Label Single Coil Pickups are slightly higher output but designed to still achieve ultimate vintage single coil sound. The reverse-wound middle pickup achieves those classic tones and overtones, while offering multiple noise-canceling positions. Many players reviewing the Tagliare say these are the best sounding single coils they have ever heard. Controls are a master volume, one tone control for neck pickup and one tone control for middle and bridge.
