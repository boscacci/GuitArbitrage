{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ventura V1400 Barney Kessel Electric Guitar - Oh My Goodness! Welcome All! You are looking at a Made-in-Japan, Ventura, Barney Kessel Style Electric Guitar This one will surely not win any beauty contests - but LAWDY WHAT A SOUND! I bought this guitar from a gentlemen whom had bought it as a project guitar and put a considerable amount of time and money into its rehab. If you are looking for an all-original version of this classic guitar this is not it. He has put new pickups in place; a Duncan Jazz in the neck and a Gibson 490T in the bridge (and these sound GREAT) He put new electronics in place; pots, switch and jack from Stew-Mac He put new amber bell shaped knobs from Stew-Mac He replaced the tuners with Gotoh chrome tulip tuners He installed a Graph-Tech String Saver nut (now called Black Tusq) and a German hand made ebony bridge He ordered a custom replacement pickguard for a Gibson Barney Kessel in brown tortoise and a top of the line pickguard bracket What he did NOT do - is cosmetically refurbish this classic player. I will even call this ROUGH. A bit hard to look at but OH CAN SHE SING! Please see all the pics and judge the condition for yourself. Please Note - No Case. Guitar will be securely packed and shipped - I am an EXPERT Shipper! Shipping: $40.00 (will be shipped within 3 business days of payment) USA Sales/Shipping ONLY, PayPal ONLY, NO Returns Thanks for looking. At 64, it is time for me to part with some of my favorite toys! I am a lifelong musician, music major and multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, trumpet, tenor sax) and have had a passion for the guitar since I was a kid. I have performed in most every description of organized musical format from concert orchestras to garage bands, brass quintets to acoustic trios, jazz labs to show bands - and have enjoyed every one. Currently working with a pop/jazzy duo playing guitar and a bit of trumpet - real cool stuff! I grew up a staunch Fender and Gibson man - still have my original 67 BF Fender Super Reverb, but have spent the last 20 years exploring and discovering the delights and joys of guitars and amps of all makes, models and descriptions (more than 100 guitars!). There\u2019s a LOT of great gear out there! I will only sell gear that I feel someone will truly enjoy and don\u2019t want anyone to buy one of my items unless they feel confident it is right for them. I do my very best to describe the items completely and accurately and welcome any questions one may have about a piece of interest.

I\u2019m a good guy looking to put some great gear into new hands!", "ItemID": "163418051812", "EndTime": "2018-12-06T20:43:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-06T20:38:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ventura-V1400-Barney-Kessel-Style-Electric-Guitar-Made-Japan-Mods-/163418051812", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Leesburg, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634180518128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk3WDE2MDA=/z/GRoAAOSwnWpcAAhi/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODkyWDE2MDA=/z/BkAAAOSwWrxcAAiW/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk4WDE2MDA=/z/wLYAAOSw1KRcAAhy/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk0WDE2MDA=/z/RYgAAOSwV3hcAAht/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODkzWDE2MDA=/z/G3wAAOSwgGZcAAho/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODkzWDE2MDA=/z/Bf0AAOSwztVcAAh4/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA0WDE2MDA=/z/kmkAAOSwXgxcAAh9/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODkzWDE2MDA=/z/kcUAAOSw3fxcAAiC/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA1WDE2MDA=/z/xF0AAOSwaPpcAAiH/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg5WDE2MDA=/z/xGcAAOSwaPpcAAiM/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODkxWDE2MDA=/z/DAUAAOSwK1RcAAiR/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODkxWDE2MDA=/z/G3wAAOSwNYtcAAkk/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "20176", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "r-man5555", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 744}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ventura V1400 Barney Kessel Style Electric Guitar - Made in Japan + Mods", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["VENTURA"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["70's"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["V1400 Barney Kessel"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Jazz"]}]}, "HitCount": 3, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Sounds wonderful - Looks rough.
