{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a 2006 MIM Fender Stratocaster 60th anniversary special edition with upgrades including the 920D loaded pickguard with custom shop Fender fat 50's pickups (standard on all USA Stratocasters) with genuine CTS pots and a switchcraft 5 way upgraded switch. If you have never heard these pickups you will be quite pleased as to how musical they sound, in my opinion they are the best sounding traditional single coils hands down. Along with the upgraded electronics I installed Sperzel locking tuners and replaced the stock old style bridge pieces with more modern style alloy saddles which allow for better sustain and tone. Finally the tremolo has been set up to float correctly and does not go out of tune. The body has no noticeble dings or gouges, and the fret wear is normal for a guitar of this age. There is no buzz and the action is set up and intonated correctly. Guitar is very clean and has been kept in my smoke free home. I am including the old saddle pieces, tuners and component labels that came with the 920D loaded pickguard. I don't have the original pickguard. This is a great guitar and the upgrades I have made are more than $350 dollars. This guitar sings and comes with a quality $100.00 gigbag.
