{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale here today is an Ibanez AR300 from the golden era of the late 70s/early 80s. NOT the AR300 of the 90s and beyond. I'll leave sorting the exact year to the experts. Sounds fantastic, and as you can see the build quality is insane. The inlay work has a deep 3D quality to it that doesn't get done justice in photos. This is an abnormally nice top for this series, with deep reds and tight flame. Pitting on the bridge components is normal for these guitars, and is photographed for your consideration. The parts can be replated if you wish, but I'd leave that up to you. The guitar has been played and you can see scratches in the finish that are NOT through to the wood. There is a ding on the back of the neck joint which reaches the wood, you can see this in the pictures. No cracks or breaks. Frets have play wear. I didn't refret it, but you may want to. Frets are a personal choice, so I'm leaving that to the one who is going to play the guitar for the next few decades. Non-original hardshell case included. I'm not trying to make any money on shipping, but I've been burned before eating 100 bucks or more in unexpected shipping. If international shipping costs less than my imagined figure, I'll refund the difference to actual cost.
