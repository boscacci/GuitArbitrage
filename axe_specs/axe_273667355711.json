{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Original 1994 Ibanez Talman Japan electric guitar lipstick pickups Original 1994 Ibanez Talman Japan electric guitar lipstick pickups w/ Ibanez Hard Case, generic soft case, amp. Original condition, just tuned by vintage guitar shop in Annapolis. Nothing messed with just tuned, all original. Serial F420960, made in 1994 FujiGen Gakki Nagano Japan. Includes original guitar hardshell case, soft gig bag, guitar strap and a working practice amplifier. Finish: Black. Model has scarce 3 single coil lipstick pickups. The Ibanez looks and works great with some minor scuffs from use, one tiny chip on side. Overall, nothing major. Very well set up and easy to play. Hard case has normal wear and is very usable, but soft gig bag is sweet. Amp is tested and works fine. Was told Talman was a TC630, but I\u2019m not certain. Could also be a TC530 or similar model. Compare to 2 current auctions for similar Ibanez in last pic over $1100. Guitar with hard shell case costs over $150 to ship, so not shipping.
