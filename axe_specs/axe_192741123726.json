{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson ES-325 1976 ELECTRIC GUITAR - NICE WITH CASE. Case does show wear from age and storage but is still very functional and performs as expected, all clasps shut without issue. Guitar has minor wear, I see no major issues, but I am not a guitar expert, please check photos and ask questions if needed. The guitar looks really nice, it appears to have been nicely cared for. It has been with the last owner for 35 years. Again, I see no major issues with this guitar, cosmetically there are a few minor spots of wear from normal use and aging. I took good pictures so you can make your own assessment. I believe the date stamp is 127634, but it is really hard to read for certain. Be sure to check the photos, the item pictured is exactly what you will receive. I am selling some very nice guitars and other musical instruments this week in auction format. Please be sure to view my other items. A couple of these guitars are very rare and very nice. A great Christmas present for yourself or someone you know. There are no returns on these musical instruments. On Dec-01-18 at 02:41:31 PST, seller added the following information: I will ship this international. Shipping looks to be $200 in a form fitting box (due to international package size restrictions), but it can be done if interested.", "ItemID": "192741123726", "EndTime": "2018-12-07T01:20:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-30T01:20:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-ES-325-1976-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-NICE-WITH-HARD-CASE-AUCTION-/192741123726", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hillsborough, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927411237268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/j7IAAOSwyupa3P3F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/3ykAAOSwtdpa3P3k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/DEkAAOSw7eda3P3r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/pZ8AAOSwswVa3P3y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/4KcAAOSwLpda3P34/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/VVMAAOSwZTJa3P39/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/8GEAAOSwh4Ra3P4D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/7~gAAOSwtuBa3P4H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/X~cAAOSwiURa3P4O/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/WbQAAOSwZ-Ba3P4U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/u3YAAOSwLDFa3P4g/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/GB0AAOSwn4da3P4a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27278", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kennybrooks", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 7269, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.1, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 44, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 18}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson ES-325 1976 ELECTRIC GUITAR - NICE -WITH HARD CASE - AUCTION !!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["ES-325"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1976"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}]}, "HitCount": 550, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=243534", "StoreName": "Kenny Brooks Estate Treasures"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Case does show wear from age and storage.
