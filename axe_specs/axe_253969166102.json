Yamano Music is a distributor in Japan that is known to buy only the finest quality of Gibson guitars. Each one comes with a special Yamano Music Certificate. Unfortunately, we do not have the original Gibson COA. This guitar is in very good condition and in perfect working order. There are some light scratches, dings, tarnish to the gold hard-wear, and some wear on the back. Overall, I would give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 condition. Everything on the guitar is original. There are no cracks, repairs, or major issues. The neck is straight with no issues. The original frets are in excellent condition with only minor wear. There is no buzzing or dead spots.
