{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hohner OSCII HSH Electric Guitar. QUALITY INSTRUMENT from lesser-known German company. Mid-2000s and was $679 new. Sounds amazing! The Tesla Plasma pickups in HSH configuration with a push/pull for coil taps make a ton of very usable sounds. Flame maple top with Ash body. Looks more like a Gibson but makes Fender sounds too. Sorry, no case at this price. The OSC line was intended to be a guitar made from the best qualities of a Stratocaster and Telecaster and packaged in an innovative design. And this guitar truly is a great combination of the two guitars. It plays great and has incredible versatility of tone. You play anything from rock and roll to funk and jazz. The natural finish on the guitar brings out the beautiful solid ash wood and makes this guitar a real looker. Ask body with maple top. Archtop singlecut.Maple neck with rosewood fretboard. Really nice bolt-on neck joint.25\" scale length.24 frets. Grover tuners. Tesla Plasma pickups are amazing! This guitar is used but very nice and priced right! You seriously will not be disappointed! Great tone and playability. Don't be put off by the cheap price... I'm practically giving it away. It's a quality instrument.
