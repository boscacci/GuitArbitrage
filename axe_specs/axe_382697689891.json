{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hollow body D'Angelico Guitar, With the D'Angelico case it came in. Guitar has some scratches and has some difficulty with feedback, if you're trying to have a heavier tone. It's more of a jazz guitar than anything. The pickups on the guitar are a bit weak but they get the job done. The guitar case has some dings as well, Both still work perfectly fine. The strings coming with it are ernie ball pinks. It's a beautiful looking guitar and would also work as a collection piece. The guitar case has \"Thunder Butt\" Written in yellow Sharpie right next to the handle, I've done my best to get it out but If you really don't want any remnants of \"Thunder Butt\" Of your guitar case, You may need fo buff it out a bit. The guitar has locking pegs, It comes with the strap in the pictures, It's very high quality and made to last. The bridge is inside of the Case storage space, the guitar needs it's intonation adjusted. You can just bring it into a shop, or if you're a guitar engineer and want to just soup the whole thing up. That'd probably be the move", "ItemID": "382697689891", "EndTime": "2019-01-03T22:13:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-27T22:13:21.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/D-Angelico-Excel-Electric-Guitar-Hard-Guitar-Case-/382697689891", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3826976898918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ekAAAOSwaPNcJUp9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pwUAAOSwMKxcJUp~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FCsAAOSwdhdcJUqD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3KcAAOSwcH5cJUqF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/u8YAAOSwg5FcJUqI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7y0AAOSwGq5cJUqK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BeEAAOSwRDJcJUqM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/baUAAOSwZ2tcJUqO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jH0AAOSw8LZcJUqR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "55418", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lowba-81", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 17, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 501.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 501.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 152}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "D Angelico Excel Electric Guitar, &  Hard Guitar Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["D'Angelico"]}]}, "HitCount": 346, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 511.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
