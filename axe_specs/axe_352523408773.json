I will not ship anywhere else.Most deliveries will require a signature.Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier Affinity Series \"Custom Shack Tele\" with some nice upgrades.. The maple 21 fret neck has near zero fret wear and has had a nice headstock makeover with many coats of clear over the decal. The very cool Butterscotch body has some tiny dings on the edge I tried to show in the pictures and and features a top modern style six saddle fixed bridge. Besides the dings some heavier scratches on the back. The pickups are some nice alnico 5's. I also upgraded the capacitor with a .033uf axial film capacitor. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound killer on this guitar. Action is good and could probably lowered even more. Guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
