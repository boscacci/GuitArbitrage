{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "GRECO EG59-70 CRS Mint Collection Series 1989 Cherry Red Sunburst MIJ Serial #: 9 5782 Wow! Check out this Greco Mint Collection Series EG59-70! Cherry Red Sunburst finish w/1ply cream pickguard. MADE IN JAPAN. 1989 Fujigen manufacture. Mahogany body w/highly flamed maple top, mahogany neck, long neck tenon, and factory stock on the model DRY front and rear humbuckers! It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few small marks on it here and there Has a bit of finish chipping on the body back bottom edge corner other that nothing that I found that I would call significant and overall I'd say that it's fine shape! Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the neck, body, and headstock are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Low E-string tuner has a bit of a bend to the stem but otherwise operates normally. Both plastic pickup rings have thin cracks neither of which I found to affect pickup stability or play in any way. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic! Big beefy tone and loads of power with the DRY humbuckers! Plays great! High flame to the maple top on this one looks awesome! No gigbag. If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Shipping inside of the USA is $55 by USPS Priority Mail which is registered, insured, and trackable. Please allow 2 to 3 days for delivery.
