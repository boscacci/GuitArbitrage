{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Gibson Chet Atkins Country Gentleman is from the latter part of the era when Gibson had won Mister Guitar's coveted endorsement, after his definitive relationship with Gretsch (to which the Atkins estate later chose to return). It's beautifully appointed, with matching tortoise shell pick guard and arm guard, and gold hardware that includes a Bigsby with the bent handle that Chet loved so well. This guitar practically comes alive in your hands, supercharged with potential, and able to handle any exotically-woven chord progressions or willfully obscure lead lines that you can throw at it. (Our tests indicate that it also responds well to relatively primitive rock 'n' roll.) This Gibson is in excellent condition, with only minor scratches, and an estimated 80% remaining fret life. Had issue with pickup selector switch so it was replaced. Has been checked out by qualified luthier. Hard shell original case. Check out how Gibson honored the legacy of one of music's finest guitarists! Free shipping insured to lower US. 30 day returns for refund. Buyer pays return shipping. Check out Paul Yandell playing like model on youtube. This item is also listed locally so first come first serve.
