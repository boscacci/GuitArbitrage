{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is an awesome Made in Japan Fender Santa Rosa. It\u2019s a great little short scale guitar that sounds and plays amazing. The unique body shape and design features 24 frets, an active Piezo pickup with volume and tone controls. This is great for either live or studio players looking for a way to get a good acoustic tone without all the feedback. Get the look and sound of an acoustic with the playability and feel of an electric. It\u2019s also super lightweight (around 5 pounds) so very easy on the shoulders. The guitar is in great condition with just minor signs of wear - assorted dents, scratches and marks throughout the instrument- front and back. The only mentionable flaws are two minor dents/chips (see pics 9 & 10 for details). One on the back of the headstock and the other at approx. the 3rd fret on the back of the neck. Neither effect the functionality of the guitar. Other than that, most of it is typical play wear - light scratches and markings on the body, neck and headstock. All of the electronics function as they should. Comes with the original Fender hard shell case. The case itself is functional and in decent condition. All the latches work as they should, but the back hinges are a little wonky (loose) and the interior has that weird chemical odor that a lot of the plastic cases made in the 80\u2019s-90\u2019s have. A couple of hours out of the case airs the guitar out fine. Since Fender only made this guitar for two years, it\u2019s one of the rarer MIJ guitars out there. They have a bit of a cult following, and coupled with the limited production run, they don\u2019t come up for sale very often. Here\u2019s your chance to get a great Fender Japanese made guitar without the hassle of the import taxes and fees. Sold as is, so please review pictures carefully for details and condition.
