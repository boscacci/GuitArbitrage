{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "RARE 1967 Silvertone hornet model 1451 Black Speckled finish guitar project. Condition is Used. Shipped with UPS Ground. This is a Rare Silvertone 1451 Hornet guitar (amp not included), this is very rare and were only produced for a limited time in 1967. Priced to sell due to needing some work and adjustments. Features: *Classic lipstick pickup *Slimline body *Black Speckled Paint Job ALL ORIGINAL. Please look closely at pictures. I consider this guitar a project guitar. the frets buzz, and the action needs to be set. I don't know if that means something is up with the neck and it needs to be adjusted or it needs new frets. The neck look straight when set on a table and inspected. The tuning mechanism works great, and the internals are very clean, all original. the pickup works as it should. UPDATE****: I tuned upp the guitar and just wanted to clarify the issues as to why his is considered a \"project\". The strings ring (like a sitar not like a buzz and not like they are muted, it actually plays better than I thought it just might be that the nut is worm and that is the issue otherwise the tuners are in great shape and the string distance looks just right, it might just be a little close not he first fret that causes the ring, see new pictures. Also not he back there is a bolt missing where the next meets the body, I don't know if the affects anything, but you might want to replace in order for the guitar to be complete.It has the potential to be a great solid vintage everyday player for someone with just a little more time than me to clean it up. Cosmetic Condition is Good. Working Condition is Fair. It has some wear, nicks not eh paint. I can answer any questions you may have, and local pickup is available in the Milwaukee/Chicago area. Shipping a Flat $60.00 anywhere in the lower 48 via UPS.
