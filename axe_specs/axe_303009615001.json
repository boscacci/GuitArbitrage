{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here we have a beautiful Custom Fender Telecaster. The body is a gorgeous swamp ash in sunburst. The Neck is a 50's C shape maple, de-glossed to look vintage. The body and neck are made by Fender. The bridge is the high quality Gotoh with compensated Gotoh brass saddles. The tuners are vintage style from Gotoh. The pickups are Rio Grande Muy Grande made in Texas. These are a little fatter and hotter sounding than standard tele pickups, with no ice pick highs, and perfect for blues or any style of music. The pickguard is anodized aluminum in matte black. This guitar has a great pro setup with low action and the intonation set. There is no fret wear and everything works perfect. Take a look and listen to the Rio Grande's on youtube. This is a fabulous guitar. I will include a padded gig bag. I have over $800 invested and am starting the auction at a low price. Please ask all questions before bidding. I accept PayPal only and ship to only PayPal confirmed addresses in the lower 48 United States. I pack well and ship within one business day. Thank you for looking!

Pictures always seem to enhance reds.If anyone wants to see the bruise on the back edge, let me know, and I can send you a picture.", "ItemID": "303009615001", "EndTime": "2019-01-04T00:00:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-28T00:00:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Custom-Ash-Maple-Telecaster-Rio-Grande-Tele-Guitar-50s-C-Neck-/303009615001", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Vergennes, Vermont", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030096150018080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1BUAAOSwTSlcJF0H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/O5oAAOSwnKFcJF1Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5b4AAOSwWrNcJF1B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bwQAAOSwIbtcJF2J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/86QAAOSwG49cJF21/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cC8AAOSwsRVcJF4I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9AcAAOSwG49cJF45/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/W3EAAOSwTEZcJF5z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wqMAAOSw8R9cJF5-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bL0AAOSw8a9cJF72/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kSsAAOSwg5FcJF7l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4PsAAOSw4m9cJF9J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "05491", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bassicallyfender", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1504, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 409.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 409.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 953}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Custom Ash Maple Telecaster Rio Grande Tele Guitar 50s C Neck", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst Ash"]}]}, "HitCount": 343, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 414.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "New build in excellent condition!
