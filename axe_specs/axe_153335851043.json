{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Supro Americana Series Belmont Vibrato - Poppy RedPlayed very little; there is a dent in case from tremolio; it was that way when i got it and i didn't think it was worth the hassle of returning since it did not damage the guitar ; The case is just a tight fit . Decided to save up for a expensive guitar so a few have to go ; no issues, like new except maybe a little dusty . Strings are not even stretched in yet . This thing plays great and has a certain sound to it . Not like any other guitar I have owned . More like a Gretsch but different . Even if you do not get this one , try one .
