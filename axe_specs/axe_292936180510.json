{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage Peavey t-60 guitar with case. Condition is Used. I have owned this guitar for years, but it isn't getting played, due primarily to the number of guitars I own. I bought all of the parts/pieces of this guitar individually and assembled it. Prior to assembly, I sanded and refinished the body. I know one switch is not original, but do not remember if the pots are original. The pickups are original, and they work. Look closely at the picks and ask any questions. Please note that the pickguard has a crack in it. Buyer should think of this guitar as a project. It will need new strings, as well as a crown polish. It is not perfect, but can be made into a decent player. Hard case is included. Shipping to CONUS only.", "ItemID": "292936180510", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T18:44:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-27T18:44:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Peavey-t-60-guitar-case-/292936180510", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929361805108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/LV4AAOSwaEdcTfn1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/YYkAAOSwjF9cTfn8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/soAAAOSw8PJcTfnq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/ns4AAOSwJ4hcTfnq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/JE4AAOSwDgJcTfoL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/ccQAAOSweshcTfoR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/KzsAAOSwZKlcTfoV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/cNIAAOSwx3FcTfnr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/e1cAAOSw6IdcTfoc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/LP8AAOSw-tdcTfns/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/d2AAAOSw-iZcTfoi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28277", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mojowilson", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1427, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 321.55, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 321.55, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 288}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Peavey t-60 guitar with case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 783, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 326.55, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
