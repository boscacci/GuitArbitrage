{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For your consideration is a black and white Epiphone Flying V Custom with a hard shell case. This is in excellent condition with no nicks, dings or dents and with just faint scratches from play and handling. The tips are perfect with no damage. This guitar is all stock with no alterations that I am aware of. It even has the plastic on the pickups that I left on while I decided if this guitar was for me. This is a B stock guitar. I talked to the refurbisher and was told that the only issues were electrical and it was all corrected. The guitar plays fine with no problems. The only things I can see cosmetically was that there was some residue in the neck bolt holes and behind the through-the-body string ferrules. This was kind of waxy so I imagine it was polishing the guitar. The paint is not perfect around the screw heads and ferrules but you really have to look for it to see it. As you can see, I like to describe my items as thoroughly as possible so there are no surprises or disappointments. The case was used when I got it and has some slight damage to the bottom front right corner and some spots on the finish. The inside is perfect. I\u2019m a short guy and this guitar is just too large for me. It\u2019s really cool to look at but I don\u2019t have a large playing area and I\u2019m always worried about bumping the tips when playing. Time to pass it along to someone who can get better use of it. The only shipping option I have in my town is the USPS. I am estimating the shipping cost based on past experience with other guitars I have sold. If I am high in my estimate, I will REFUND the excess shipping amount rounded up to the nearest dollar. I hate overpaying for shipping! I will also pay for insurance out of my pocket to make sure that if something does go wrong,that neither the buyer nor seller will be out any money. I will accept returns with the buyer paying return shipping. Please note that I have 100% feedback rating as a seller so bid with confidence. I will ship to the continental United States only and I will ship within 2 business days of receiving payment.
