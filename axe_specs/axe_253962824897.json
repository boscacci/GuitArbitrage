{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Rickenbacker 12 string (2008 FireGlo)Very little play time, never used for shows or tour, no visible fret wear, and does not have any dings or blemishes in the finish, other than what you would expect from a lightly used instrument. It is a 2008 model based on the serial number and documentation in the case. It has that 60's \"Jingle-jangle\" sound that you can only get from a true Rickenbacker 12 String. The guitar was recently gone through by a Rick tech and strung with new THOMASTIK-INFELD Flat Wound strings, which cost $350 (see last pict for details). Comes complete with original RIC hard shell case. the Please email with any questions before you bid. Shipping higher to Alaska and Hawaii. No International shipping. PayPal payment is expected within 48 hours or the item will be re-listed.On Nov-05-18 at 13:21:51 PST, seller added the following information: A point of clarification:The new flat wound strings themselves cost around $62.00. The $350 mentioned in the description was the total cost for the strings and labor for the RIC guitar tech to go through it, install the strings, and set it up for studio/recording. The guitar was originally purchased for my daughter who is an artist (Google Anna Clendening), it has less than an hour of playing time on the new strings. It plays really well with these flat wounds and sounds just like when Roger McGuinn was laying down Tambourine Man.", "ItemID": "253962824897", "EndTime": "2018-11-06T04:52:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-03T04:52:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rickenbacker-330-12-Fireglo-EXCELLENT-CONDITION-/253962824897", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2539628248978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/SeEAAOSwlAFb3SQV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/~ycAAOSw~29b3SQX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/tAcAAOSwcQpb3SQZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/wvkAAOSwdr1b3SQb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/LXwAAOSwNe9b3SQd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/FroAAOSwMjpb3SRH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/AvsAAOSwm-Fb3SRK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/k5wAAOSwZs1b3SRM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/OHkAAOSw7PJb3SRO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DMwAAOSwDrpb3SRP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/KdsAAOSwihVb3SRR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/dJkAAOSw--xb3SRT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27516", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "buysellcisco247", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 137, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5310}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rickenbacker 330/12 Fireglo  EXCELLENT CONDITION", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Rickenbacker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2008"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["12 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["330/12"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Fireglo"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 306, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
