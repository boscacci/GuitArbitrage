{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Don\u2019t let the excessively worn looking neck fool you, the frets are still in like new condition, and all that fretboard wear and rolled edges makes the neck feel very inviting to play. The action is superb, and the intonation is spot on. Oh, and an extra fret (fret 22) was added to the end of the fretboard. The original wiring has been upgraded to include a 3-way toggle pickup selector, instead of the original rotary switch, a 3-way mini tone switch for half and full tone roll off, or none in the center, and a push-pull coil tap volume pot. Even though this is a fairly new guitar, every requisite ding, wear make, cigarette burn, non-destructive corrosion and rust, was added to ensure that what you get feels like an old friend using a very meticulous process. Look at all the pics to see the details!! You know you\u2019ve wanted a cool relic\u2019d guitar, but didn\u2019t want to spend $$\u2019s to get one. Now\u2019s your chance to own a luthier approved relic for a fraction of what you would expect to pay!! Comes with semi-rigid guitar case shown in the pictures. Bid with confidence. Thanks for looking and good luck bidding.

Not only has it been relic'd, to look 50 years old, but it has had various upgrades as well including, a new SCN stacked Fender single coil pickup in the neck, and a Seymour Duncan distortion chrome humbucker in the bridge position, new, and relic'd old. The original plastic nut was replaced with bone. The original top load bridge was replaced with a much better quality, and heavier, string-through body bridge. On the headstock you will notice an authentic 1948 \"Fender Broadcaster\" decal in place of the original black stencil \"Squier 51\" logo, with an old string retainer in the \"correct\" location.
