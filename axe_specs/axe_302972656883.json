{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is my Vintage Electra X130 Phoenix guitar. These guitars are well known for their great quality and value. Built in Japan and imported by St Louis Music this ash bodied guitar with a nice maple neck, hot mmk humbuckers, brass nut, bridge, a three way switch, and another switch to split the coils. This finish is sharp and I think it is harder to find than the others. This guitar has been played and has light blemishes, and the fingerboard has play discoloration on the 2nd and 3rd frets-- there is no indentation. Frets have plenty of life left in them. This is completely original and an excellent representation of this model. It is solid as a rock and holds tune well. Attached is a video of a demo of this same model https://youtu.be/0wR9GUDLe_o", "ItemID": "302972656883", "EndTime": "2018-12-01T00:17:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-26T00:17:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Electra-Phoenix-X130-Guitar-/302972656883", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Columbus, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029726568838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uM8AAOSwOWdb9KPe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WLYAAOSwcZ1b9KPg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LNsAAOSwL49b9KPi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XdoAAOSwRfxb9KPj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PWEAAOSwIKNb9KPl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kQEAAOSwqnVb9KPo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8ikAAOSwpwBb9KPp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hmIAAOSw9ipb9KPr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jRYAAOSwJtJb9KPt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dxgAAOSwlfNb9KPv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/26YAAOSwqS5b9KPy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "43207", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pam8260", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 646, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 279.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 279.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 315}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Electra Phoenix X130 Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Electra"]}]}, "HitCount": 68, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 284.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
