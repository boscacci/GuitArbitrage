{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2002 USA Gibson Crescent Moon SG Special - Limited edition model. GOOD- The guitar is in good used condition with light scratches and dings from years of play. The volume/tune knobs have chips and a couple are missing the silver face but they\u2019re fully functional. The neck is great. Very straight with low comfy action. Tuners keep tune just fine THE NOT SO GOOD- So here\u2019s the rub...This SG has a very well repaired old head fracture. It\u2019s been over 10 years since the accident and repair. The crack is nearly invisible unless you\u2019re looking at it closely in just the right light. I can\u2019t feel it with my fingers but can vaguely feel it if I run my fingernail over it. It was very well done. Low price reflects this issue. Don\u2019t worry. This one still rocks it! It plays and sounds like the beautiful Gibson that it is.
