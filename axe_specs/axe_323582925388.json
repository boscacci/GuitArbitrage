{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Epiphone's Les Paul Plus Top Pro/FX has all the great features and looks of a Les Paul but adds a double-locking Floyd Rose tremolo and coil-splitting for an amazing combination of crunch and versatility. In the neck position is Epiphone's Alnico Classic humbucker, which provides warmth and subtle tone with a full, even response that doesn't hold back when you need that classic humbucker crunch. In the bridge position is the Alnico Classic Plus humbucker. A perfect companion to the Classic, it is overwound for a slightly higher output without sacrificing its rich, vintage tone. Both feature Alnico-II magnets, enamel wire, and are double vacuum waxed. 4-wire output on each pup allows for coil-tapping, and this Les Paul guitar takes full advantage of it with push/pull potentiometers on both volume controls. Combined with the 3-way toggle, these give you 8 killer tones in one great Les Paul guitar. The Epiphone Pro/FX guitar features a Floyd Rose Special nickel-plated tremolo. The Les Paul body is routed out in back of the tremolo to allow for pitch raising up to 2-1/2 steps while the downward range is wide enough to get the strings slack. It's combined with an R4 locking nut for improved tuning stability. As with all great Epiphone Les Paul guitars, the Pro/FX features a solid Mahogany back with a highly flamed maple top and a solid mahogany neck that's hand-fitted and glued into the body for excellent neck-to-body contact. The neck features a SlimTaper \"D\" profile that's both comfortable and fast. Other features on the Epiphone Les Paul guitar include quality Grover machine heads, LockTone Tune-O-Matic/stopbar, and Epiphone's own StrapLocks.
