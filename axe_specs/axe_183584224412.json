{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here's a really sweet G.E. Smith Telecaster - Custom model. Limited run #143. They don't make these anymore! The GE Tele has a wonderful reputation - deservedly so - the 9.97k Nocaster bridge pickup is the same pickup that has become super desirable over the years as the \"10k Nocaster\" pickup. The neck pickup is clear, yet full sounding. This particular guitar is rare in the it is FEATHERWEIGHT at only 7.1lbs. Many of these guitars were a fair bit heavier....but here we have a spanky resonant piece of premium ash with a beautiful Nitrocellulose Lacquer finish. The neck is a big \"U\" with very cool lap steel inlays. The whole guitar just plays and sounds like a great old Tele. Condition is excellent - there's a tiny bit of edge wear in one spot (pictured) and a few dings on the board - not thru the finish (pictured). Otherwise this guitar has seen very little use and has been stored in its case in a smoke-free home. I changed the cap to a paper-in-oil, but the original is in the case. Comes with original tweed case and all the paperwork and case candy unopened.

E. Smith who, among a number of other musical jobs, has been the director of the Bob Dylan Band as well as the director of the long running Saturday Night T V Show Band. He teamed with Fender to create this unique guitar. Mounting the bridge pickup to the body eliminates squeal and allows louder volume levels before feedback. A fatter neck gives a darker, fuller tone and the dual vintage single-coil pickups give a true classic Tele tone. Limited edition Run.
