{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "ESP E-II Horizon made in Japan. Neck through construction. This guitar is like new no scratches or dents or dings, mint condition. These are not usually even available in the USA but I found one ESP dealer that had one. These are very unique being white with an off white binding around the neck and body. Sorry I do not have the original ESP hard case but I have a Caparison hard case that is also new, included. Guitar has an original Floyd Rose tremolo made in Germany that is upgraded with big brass block and noiseless springs. I will include the back cover for the tremolo (not pictured). Seymour Duncan pickups, I can't remember exactly which ones, I think it was a JB and 59. Also the volume is push/push to split coils. Three way pickup switch. Ebony fretboard. Ash body. The guitar is perfect. Sounds great and plays great! USA buyers only please. No international buyers. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "333036198808", "EndTime": "2019-01-30T03:31:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T05:29:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-E-II-Horizon-hard-case-mint-condition-made-Japan-E-S-P-Floyd-Rose-/333036198808", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Spanish Fork, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330361988088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/NkUAAOSwmqZcS-xC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/PF8AAOSw9g1cS-xD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DowAAOSw97hcS-zM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/NiUAAOSwXFRcS-xE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/KFUAAOSwjW9cS-xC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/VRYAAOSwpRxcS-xC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/HVIAAOSwtutcS-xE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/dbEAAOSwpLdcS-xC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/7IIAAOSwYEVcS-yG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/IyYAAOSwfMlcS-xE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/UAwAAOSwjYVcS-xE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/l44AAOSwKV9cS-xE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84660", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kesronx", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 479, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 712}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP E-II Horizon with hard case mint condition made in Japan E.S.P.
