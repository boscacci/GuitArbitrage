{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2005 Gibson Custom Shop 1957 Les Paul Model Historic Reissue Goldtop Gloss EXC Excellent used condition. Serial number 7517xx. Goldtop Les Paul Standard reissue with desirable Madagascar Rosewood fretboard and tightly-grained, flatsawn Mahogany body. Madagascar Rosewood is now listed on both the CITES Appendix II and IUCN Red List. Finish is very thin and hard and not soft or sticky feeling, and has nicely shrunk and sunken into the pores of the wood like an old finish does. Unusual in that it has the black Les Paul Custom style plastic hardware instead of the typical cream color. Neck is big and round, not mammoth, but certainly not small. Weight is 9.0lbs. This is a gloss finished guitar and not an artificially aged or VOS model. Overall condition is excellent with just a few light cosmetic marks that are very difficult to photograph, mainly a few light dings from normal light use that do not break the finish on the back, but the top and neck are nearly flawless. The plastic jackplate has been upgraded to a nickel plated metal replacement. It has a little bit of natural hardware patina - all from age and normal handling from typical at home use. This guitar clearly has not been played a whole lot. Fresh setup including intonation, medium action with 10-46 gauge nickel round wound strings. Nut slot is evenly spaced and probably not quite slotted deeply enough, but the new owner can have it final slotted to preference. Neck is straight. No fretwear or playability issues. The reissue case is also in nice condition inside and out and includes the lock key. This guitar has alot of sustain and note bloom. This one is a player's dream; it has \"the\" tone. It is simply an exceptional instrument that will please even the most discerning player or collector. All photos were taken indoors with an inexpensive digital camera with no additional light or fancy photo editing. What is shown and described above is exactly what you are bidding on. $59.99 FedEx insured shipping, CUSA only. Package tracking included. Will ship in a proper guitar shipping carton and have a U-Line \"shockwatch\" (rough transit/handling shock detector) attached. Sale is final to winning bidder. PayPal payment only.
