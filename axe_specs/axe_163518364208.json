{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2016 Gibson Explorer Electric Guitar This is a previously owned 2016 Gibson Explorer Electric Guitar. The guitar has been tested and is in good, working condition. It is used and shows some middle wear. There is a pretty obvious check at one corner of the body as well as some checks on the head stock. There are light scuffs and scratches on the body from common wear and tear and some mild buckle rash on the back of the guitar. The middle knob is loose and can be moved, along with the electronics attached, inside the guitar. The knob still functions but there is an issue there that may required a repair. Please note the price is set to address that this guitar may need a little work and will most likely need a setup. There is no major damage to the instrument, just signs that is has been regularly played. Unfortunately I do not have a case for the guitar. Please look closely at all photos. A signature will be required upon delivery. Thank you! 310276-11 Thank you for taking the time to check out our listing. The vast majority of our items are previously owned and used.
