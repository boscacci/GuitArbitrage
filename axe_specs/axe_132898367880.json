{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a 2013 Gibson sgj in White. This is a factory finish. This guitar is in good condition and functions as it should. It has a few scratches and dings here and there as well as pick scratches. (pictured) The pickups have been changed to a covered Gibson 490r, and a Lindy fralin pure paf. The only issue with this guitar is it has a small crack near the control cavity on the back which is also pictured. It doesn't affect the guitar in any way and will probably never get bigger. Comes with a new Roadrunner molded plastic sg case.", "ItemID": "132898367880", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T05:16:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T21:24:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/GIBSON-SGJ-2013-SG-Hand-Rubbed-White-/132898367880", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Morton, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328983678808080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9YsAAOSw1IhcGBdw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Cx4AAOSwQZVcGBdz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O8UAAOSwiJZcGBdt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lM8AAOSwYj9cGBds/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8xgAAOSwdxVcGBdt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1NkAAOSws0pcGBdt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Wv8AAOSwwqVcGBdu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N8IAAOSwDuxcGBdt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j80AAOSwF7lcGBdx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vI4AAOSwgotcGBdx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eSsAAOSwZtRcGyEs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HN8AAOSwXItcGyEs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "61550", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wheely_joer", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 193, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1107}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "GIBSON SGJ 2013 SG Hand Rubbed White", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 104, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
