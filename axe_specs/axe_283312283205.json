{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a pretty rare bird... And I do mean PRETTY! 1975 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe, with a custom-order only natural finish AND custom order mahogany neck (they were typically maple necks during this era). This guitar rocks. Period. Part of a pro studio collection, and folks ALWAYS gave that little head nod and sly smile we all know whenever they played her... Paired with our 1965 Marshall JTM45 you could hold your own at Crossroads with this thing. Currently outfitted with a pair of Gibson P90 custom shop pickups from an R6 reissue. Barks, honks, face melts, or throw it on neck pickup only and find your new favorite rhythm tone... I'm pretty sure God intended Les Paul's to have P90's in them, but somehow the message got mixed up early on when PAF's kicked butt... BUT, not to worry, if you dig the original 1970s Pat # mini-humbuckers, they're included too (I'll even install them if you'd like, but seriously-- you wanna hear this thing with P90s first!). Gorgeous aged natural maple cap... Beautiful mahogany grains throughout the rest. I'm effusive about her, 'cause I love this one that much... And because of my emotional attachment to how she plays I'm probably overlooking a ding, or wart, or two. But I say this because I don't want her to end up spending the rest of her life hanging on a wall somewhere. Great guitars should be played NOT stared at!!! She needs somebody who'll play her in bars, and clubs, and with the dials at \"10\" on a stage somewhere! Buy it quick before I change my mind... (We're thinning out a pro studio collection... See our other auction for a 1956 Strat repro that was custom-built for Jeff Shepherd/Sheptone pickups). Comes with original case, with the original pick guard and mini humbuckers inside. Happy bidding! >>>Keep an eye out for other guitars and amps coming up for sale soon, all from our studio collection: 1966 Gibson ES-330 (sunburst)... 1975 Fender P-bass (sunburst), 1968 Epiphone Rivoli bass (sunburst)... 1937 Gibson \"Recording King\" Class-A 2x6L6 combo amp (Charlie Christian special - mahogany cabinet)... 1963 Fender Deluxe non-reverb amp... 1954 Fender Tweed Deluxe...<<<", "ItemID": "283312283205", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T16:46:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T16:46:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1975-Gibson-Les-Paul-Deluxe-custom-Mahogany-neck-body-P90s-Mini-buckers-/283312283205", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833122832058080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5t8AAOSwHGxcHRRi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QY4AAOSwdzhcHRR5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b4EAAOSwC9hcHRSL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pj8AAOSwyRdcHRSl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5tsAAOSw8U9cHRSz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4SkAAOSwHexcHRS9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eTwAAOSwe9VcHROl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QAYAAOSweiFcHRRT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HwkAAOSwypZcHRT4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SrIAAOSwIsdcHRTv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "20902", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "vintagepop", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1292, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2452}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1975 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe, custom, Mahogany neck & body - P90s & Mini-buckers", "HitCount": 564, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
