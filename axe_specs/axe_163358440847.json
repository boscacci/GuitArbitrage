EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE LOW ACTION WITH NO BUZZING NO PROTRUDING FRETS FROM THE EDGES. ELECTRONICS WORK PERFECT VERY MINOR FRET WEAR AS PICTURED. STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW NECK. POSSIBLY NOT THE ORIGINAL BRIDGE BUT IT IS INTONATABLE THE WORST FLAWS ARE PICTURED. BADLY REPAIRED SCAR ON BOTTOM EDGE BELOW F HOLE. 3.5 INCH LONG HAIR LINE FINISH CRACK ON UPPER BOUT NEAR F HOLE. A FEW OTHER TINY DINGS AND VERY LITTLE HAIR LINE SCRATCHES.
