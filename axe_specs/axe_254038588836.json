{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The Guild Starfire III is outfitted with a pair of smaller, hum-canceling LB-1 \"Little Bucker\" pickups. Originally designed in the 1960s, the Little Buckers were an alternative to single-coil pickups. The output sits somewhere between a single-coil and a vintage-style PAF humbucker, offering more jangle than a PAF, but a little more warmth than a traditional single-coil. Factor in the 3-way pickup selector, and you'll discover how good the Starfire III can sound in just about any genre. Many electric guitar players are curious about hollowbody guitars for their unique tone but may consider them too big or bulky compared to most electrics. If that sounds like you, you'll definitely want to check out the thinline body of the Starfire III. Slightly less than 2\" deep, the hollow Starfire III has the warm, resonant sound you'd expect from a hollowbody, while being much more comfortable for guitarists used to thin electrics. Also, the thinner body is less prone to howling feedback from your amplifier than traditional hollowbodies.
