{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a vintage 1965 Gibson SG Special which i bought at a guitar show years ago. It has been modified to use humbuckers and has a pair of early 70s dearmond HBs installed they really sound fantantic also there is a coil tap for the bridge pickup. The back control cover has been made by a previous owner and ive never picked up a new one. The tuners have been replaced with vintage schaller machines and there is some cracking from the tuners screw holes but not shown any signs of becoming a problem Nothing wrong with this instrument that affects playability it is a real rare beauty and sounds fantastic There is a beautiful piece of wood behind the tailpiece that is very well done I assume made to cover the spot where the original vibrato was. Instead of a bridge/tailpiece the instrument has an adjustable wraparound LEO QUAN BadAss bridge. due to the modifications i am pricing this to sell fast so act quickly. Shipping to US only will be packed well in included hardshell case. thnx and enjoy!
