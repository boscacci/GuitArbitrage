A note about open-grain satin guitars. Go to Guitar Center, play a satin, open-grain SG and compare with a Poly or even a thickerNitro finish traditional. The difference in sound is amazing! Acoustically, the satin SG is more lively, louder and more dynamic ... more musical. You can also hear the difference through an amp! Shipping: Continental USA only. Local pickup Detroit area.
