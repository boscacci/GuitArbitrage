{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "USA Custom Guitars (out of Washington state) Stratocaster. Koa body with incrediblewood grain.Also has a roasted maple neck with locking tuners.No issues whatsoever, plays great.It comes with Seymour Duncan's favorite humbucker combo: a JB (bridge) and 59 (neck). Original Fender bridge, saddles and neck plate. Callaham all-steel block. No trem arm. I never bought one for the Callaham block because I only use it as if it were a hard-tail. The trem arm that fits the block is a drop-intype that can be bought easily and cheaply from the Callaham website. Comes with a gig bag (never had a case). I'm the second owner. The original owner is the one who ordered this beautiful custom guitar to be made.It has no issues whatsoever. It plays great. I just have too many guitars (Guitar Acquisition Syndrome) andit's a bit heavy for my old geezer back at just over 8 lbs. It's a bargain at the starting price but the Buy-It-Now is a bargain too (disappears after the first bid).Everything works well. No dings, pucks, buckle rash... Guitar has been cared for I've set the opening bid at the absolute lowest I'll accept. If only one person bids then that bid wins. For sale within the continental USA only. NO RETURNS. I've described the item as accurately as possible and provided a number of photos from different angles. I'm a private person, not a shop or anything. These are my personal items.Check my feedback and know you can bid with confidence. Please write with any questions. I'll try my best to answer them.I've guessed the shipping based on experience. If it is less than I've charged for shipping + insurance, I'll refund the difference. The shipping is used to cover the costs. That's all.
