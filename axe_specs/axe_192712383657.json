{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fernandes Vertigo in very good used condition. This is one unusual looking guitar but it has quickly grown on me, but I think I am going to get one of the Elite models with a Floyd Rose and neck-thru construction. Visually, it reminds me of a stylized Gibson Thunderbird. With its tune-o-matic bridge set up and clear, high-output factory humbucker pickups, the tone is more reminiscent of a Gibson SG. It does very well through a Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier fwiw !) This guitar has a nice feel and a very solid weight. The body is mahogany and the neck is maple with a rosewood fretboard. There are some dings and pick scratches on the top that are hard to see in these photos. The tuners are very stable & the frets have at least 90% of their life left. The fit and finish of Fernandes guitars continues to impress me in every way. If you haven\u2019t played one lately, you should really check them out. You will not be disappointed with this one. - Sixstringspaceboy All original / unmodified. No case included. Flat rate shipping to lower 48 United States only.
