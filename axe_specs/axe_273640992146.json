{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a Classic Original Sixties Kay K-400 Electric Guitar with 2 of the infamous \u201cKleenex Box\u201d Barney Kessel Pickups. The guitar is in fabulous playing condition. The pickups, switch, and controls are working properly with no static or buzzing, and sound incredibly powerful.The action is nice from one end of the fretboard to the other. The adjustable neck is straight, the truss rod is working, and the frets are in excellent shape showing very little wear. The finish has a few of the typical marks that you would expect to see on a guitar this old, but nothing major, just your average scratches, dings and dents, and checking in the finish. There are no breaks, cracks, or repairs, and is in excellent condition for being 50 years old. The Synchro-Sonic Bridge is original, and the tuners are the original Kluson Deluxe. Included is a felt lined case that may or may not be the original. I have tried to show as much in the photos as possible.
