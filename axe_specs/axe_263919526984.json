{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I have for sale a Danelectro DC3 guitar in a sparkle finish. The guitar works just fine and is in fair condition but could use a good setup. The neck is straight and the frets have some life left with a bit of typical wear on the first few frets. As it sit now the strings are too low and buzzing a bit on the frets. Please note: This guitar is missing the saddle height adjustment screws for the high E string. There are a few cosmetic flaws I\u2019d like to point out: -The pick guard is lifting up a bit on the bottom side of the guitar (Shown in photos). -There is a small indentation on the back side of the neck from being bumped into something (Shown in photos). -There is a mark on the neck close the neck heel (Shown in photos). This sale will include the guitar as well as a generic gig bag. The gig bag is a little dirty but only included to act as a protective measure during shipping. I will ship this item within one business day via USPS Priority Mail. If you have any questions feel free to send me a message and I\u2019ll respond ASAP. Please check out the video clip to get a little better look at this guitar. If you\u2019re using the mobile app it won\u2019t play, just open this listing in your browser.
