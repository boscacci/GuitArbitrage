{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction: 1 SpruceHill Aluminum body Telecaster style electric guitar. One owner! I purchased this guitar direct from SpruceHill back in 1982. I traded a BMW motorcycle and cash for this $3000 handmade aluminum bodied Telecaster style guitar. This guitar has less than 50 hours of playing time on it and it\u2019s barely broke in. Tuners are Schallers, humbucking pickups are Seymour Duncans made for Sprucehill. It is wired up same as traditional Telecasters. The pickups have extra lead for custom coil splitting if desired. Guitar is autographed in the neck pocket. It is a great playing and sounding guitar. It resonates well and is almost as loud as my Telecoustic, unplugged. Guitar comes with a nice FeatherLite case. Please ask any and all questions before bidding. Shipping is $55 CONTUS! More on Sprucehill guitars. Marty/SpruceHill was the original manufacturer of aluminum bodies for Fender Stratocasters. Same as with the Harley Davidson Strat and the Freddy Trevara Strat. Many guitarists have SpruceHill custom guitars ranging from Eric Clapton, Keith Richard on down. Travis Tritt played Fender Strat/alum body by Sprucehill in the 1994 Super Bowl.", "ItemID": "273559845874", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T16:34:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T16:34:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/SpruceHill-Aluminum-body-Telecaster-style-electric-guitar-excellent-condition-/273559845874", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Elkhorn, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735598458748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RfUAAOSwRjxb7E4T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gOUAAOSwHu5b7Et0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Dw0AAOSwtjhb7Et3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zeAAAOSwH0Vb7Et5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ye8AAOSw~odb7Et7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qa0AAOSwmUFb7Et9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BEcAAOSwC8pb7Et~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ks0AAOSwTxhb7EuD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~QQAAOSwo3Fb7Euf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1hAAAOSwlkpb7EuH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53121", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "oldprop75", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 320, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1230}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "SpruceHill Aluminum body Telecaster style electric guitar, excellent condition!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["SpruceHill"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Aluminum"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2003"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 219, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 720.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
