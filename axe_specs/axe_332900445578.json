To carry the tradition further, they added Bob1's \"Whip It\" guitar to the Devo Signature Model Lineup! This Eastwood guitar is modelled after the original guitar that was customized by Bob1 during the time DEVO was working on their \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d album in 1979/1980. While Bob was not a professional guitar customizer, it is interesting to note that these unique instruments were \u2018Frankensteined\u2019 by guys who were - like their music - just inspired to do something different than the norm. Bob1's original \"Whip It\" guitar was basically a solid body guitar modified with the lower horn cut off and flipped over. It is a 24 3/4\" scale guitar, mahogany body with maple top, set maple neck, dual humbuckers, dual volume and tone controls with a stop tail and a dark cherry finish. I have had this guitar in my personal collection for a year, but haven't given it the attention it deserves.\u00a0 It's time for me to cut down my collection so this one is for sale. \u2028 Features: \u2022 Mahogany Body with Maple Cap \u2022 Set Neck with Bound Fingerboard \u2022 24 \u00be\u201d scale \u2022 Medium \u201cC\u201d shaped profile \u2022 Dual Humbucking Pickups \u2022 Dual Volume Controls \u2022 Dual Tone Controls \u2022 Gold Hardware \u2022 Nashville Tune-o-Matic style bridge \u2022 Stop Tailpiece \u2022 Case:\u00a0Gig Bag Included!", "ItemID": "332900445578", "EndTime": "2018-12-27T21:12:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-24T04:08:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Eastwood-Whip-It-Guitar-Devo-Signature-Solid-Body-/332900445578", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Courtenay, British Columbia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329004455788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OnEAAOSwOWdb9xaz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/urMAAOSwZ3pb9xaz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iL4AAOSwzThb9xaz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xdcAAOSwG25b9xaz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DzkAAOSwxgNb9xaz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3XcAAOSwOzpb9xaz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "V9N 3J9", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sandy_martinuk", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 37, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 377.1, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 30}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Eastwood \"Whip It\" Guitar - Devo Signature Solid Body", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Eastwood"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Whip It"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup", "Gig Bag"]}]}, "HitCount": 171, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
