{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a 2002 Epiphone by Gibson Special Model electric guitar in a two tone sunburst. The finish has light scratches, a few dings, a few scuffs and scrapes, but is in overall good condition for a 16 year old guitar. Keep in mind my pictures are taken with lights and angles to show flaws. The guitar actually presents nicely. Dings on the headstock could be easily touched up with a drop or two of black lacquer or nail polish. I have cleaned and polished some, tightened screws, installed new volume pot, adjusted the truss rod, adjusted intonation, adjusted string height, adjusted pickup height, cleaned and oiled fretboard, installed fresh Ernie Ball Slinkys, stretched strings, and played for awhile through my little 1x12 Blackstar tube amp. This Epiphone is playing low and fast and easy.....and the overtones are ringing like a good Les Paul. This is heavier than the new ones and often some age on wood is good. My experience with most Epiphones has been good. If you give them some TLC and get the harmonics ringing and get your knobs tweaked on a good amp they sound great, like sometimes you really don\u2019t need to spend a fortune on an electric guitar. The weakest link on this guitar is the tuners, which is typical on this model. But they are holding the guitar in tune. Check out pictures and ask questions you might have. Check our rating and feedback. Sell the guitar stuff. I\u2019d be happy to send more pictures if needed. All sales are intended to be final.
