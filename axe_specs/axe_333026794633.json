The 57 Champ Fender sells now is priced at a grand and doesn't have tremolo or low-power feature so you do the math! Small superficial water stain the size of a quarter on right side which I made myself trying to clean a speck off! -------------------- A special model with unique features including a '50s era output tube bias tremolo with a \"throbbing\" pulse.The tweed Fender Champ amp of the late 1950s is a terrific practice amp, prized by countless pro players for its great sounding, low output, easy-to-record capabilities. Guitarists often turn the amp's volume up high, and manipulate the guitar's controls for a variety of sounds from pristine clean to swampy overdrive. Rock legend Eric Clapton, who recorded some of his biggest hits with a tweed Champ, still uses one today. Eric requested a special model with a couple of unique features: '50s era output tube bias tremolo, with a more \"throbbing\" pulse than later Fender tremolo circuits; and a switchable power attenuator to reduce the speaker's output if desired. The Fender Eric Clapton EC Signature Vibro-Champ 5W 1x8 Hand-Wired Tube Guitar Combo Amp is designed and built to EC's exact specifications. This interesting variation of the '57 Champ amp is a must for Clapton fans, tone seekers, and for any player seeking the ultimate in low-powered, top-quality tube performance. throughout.
