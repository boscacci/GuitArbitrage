{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1982 Ibanez Iceman IC50. This is a 1982 Ibanez Iceman IC50. Color Blue. I'm selling some of my guitars and this is one of them. This Guitar is 36 years old and is in very good condition considering its age. It has some chips, dings but not too bad for its age. There is a crack in the paint near the neck pocket. \"Paint only\" (this is not a structure issue). There is also a chip near the input jack and some on the edges. Please see pics. Neck pickup does not work. I \"think\" it\u2019s a problem with the 3 way switch but I am not an expert and you will have to make your own assessment. See pictures to see some of the issues listed here. This guitar does not have a case. It will be packed VERY well and Insured for shipping. ITEM SOLD AS IS, NO RETURNS, SO PLEASE ASK ALL QUESTIONS PRIOR TO BIDDING or BUYING. INSURED SHIPPING: (Due to eBay charging a final fee on shipping costs as well as the item cost, I must charge more than I have charged in the past when eBay did not take this money.)
