{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a early 80's Kramer Voyager made in USA rare guitar. Sounds and plays as it should. Neck plate states Kramer Made in USA. It appears to me to have had a small repair completed where a chip or slight crack was on the side of the neck heal. This does not effect its functionality or play in any way. The neck heal is shown in one of the listing pictures. The guitar will be shipped safely. There is one or more small scratches in the paint of the body. Each appear as small white dot/tiny line. I believe there are two or three very small white spots or nicks on body. On the front and the back. Feel free to ask questions etc....Matching back cover comes with guitar not pictured but matches the color scheme exactly.
