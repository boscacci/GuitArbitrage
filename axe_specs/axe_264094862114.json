{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "~ IBANEZ ROCKET ROLL II ~ Thanks for taking the time to check out my Ibanez Rocket Roll II guitar. Chances are you are already familiar with this guitar's history and are knowledgeable about its reputation. If you're not, these guitars were built to replicate the Gibson Flying V and after a lawsuit challenging the first Rocket Roll, the Rocket Roll II was born. The major changes were the headstock and the appearance of the body wood/color and hardware. This guitar is priced significantly lower because the original bridge was replaced with a Kahler tremolo system many years ago. As a result, the body was routed for the change. In one of the pictures you can see a bit of routing where part of the fixed bridge used to be. This guitar has a basswood body with chrome hardware. As you can see in the pictures, this classic axe is in fair condition. It appears to be mostly original, with the exception of the installed Kahler bridge and possibly the pickups, and plays and sounds awesome! It has several minor scratches and dings you would expect to see on a guitar of this age including several nicks on the edges where you can see the wood and a couple of neck pocket finish cracks. I've done my best to show these in the pictures. If there is anything that you'd like to see just ask and I'll send you some pics. There is some light to moderate oxidation on the bridge, which is quite common on these guitars. The playability is superb...neck perfectly straight, neck angle is perfect... frets show some wear but have plenty of life left. Pickups sound great! As you can see in the pics, the original case looks good, but has some damage /separation where the side wall meets the bottom panel at the bodies end. There is wood damage and separation at the joint. Overall, the case is fully functional and all of the latches work properly. Shipping: I will personally pack and box the guitar myself. I know how to properly ship a guitar. The guitar will be shipped using FedEx and it will be insured for the final selling price. I will also require the buyer to sign for the guitar upon delivery. Unfortunately, I will not ship outside of the continental United States.
