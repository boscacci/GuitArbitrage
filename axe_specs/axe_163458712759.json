{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here we have an interesting early piece of Japanese acoustic guitar history, re-listed for sale for genuine reasons These were imported into the UK from Japan by the famous Stentor music company, made by top men in the Terada facility, a genuinely hand made piece. She hails from the late 60's, at time before the modern X bracing was widely used, this one has the old school style of ladder bracing and sounds fabulous! So, this is a good value vintage with a fair bit of roadwear and weathering of the finish shown in photo's. Lightly refurbished by our luthier and player ready We have reset the playing action to factory standard. And it must be said, our bench time for this would be double the value of the thing! The action is low (2.7mm at 12th) so is now great to play Plenty of room on the newly installed bone saddle to alter to your preferences. Nice UK made strings fitted and some nice USA made ebony bridge pins installed So she's more than ready for the next 50 years. Player grade classic anyone?
