{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is an 80\u2019s Arbor Stiletto headless electric guitar. It is in good playing shape but has some repairs to it. Mainly, the wood seam between the mahogany neck and ash side wing was cleanly separated half was down the body and then glued. It\u2019s apparent but totally solid now. The tuners are newer chrome replacements. The Nut is missing the hanging loop often seen on these. Solid ash and mahogany construction. The frets are in great shape showing some minor wear. The neck has a very slight forward bow. The russs rod operates to remove some of the bow giving a medium action. I dont want to turn the truss rod any more in fear of breaking it. The guitar still plays pretty well and there are no dead notes. The action is just a little higher than I normally play so it doesn\u2019t suit my preferences. All electronics are checked and sound great. I will ship well packaged in a proper box.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "192776699021", "EndTime": "2019-01-04T18:37:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T05:49:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/80-s-Arbor-Stiletto-Headless-Electric-Guitar-Trans-Red-/192776699021", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927766990218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/814AAOSwy2pcKv11/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KVMAAOSwHAxcKv2B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~BoAAOSw4sNcKv16/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v0kAAOSwwFNcKv15/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZcMAAOSw2xlcKv12/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lqYAAOSwt~1cKv18/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cMYAAOSwmE5cKv2A/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/etAAAOSwIvBcKv19/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/koEAAOSwusdcKv1-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rxgAAOSw~KNcKv2C/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q0wAAOSwUMBcKv2E/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6611, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 786}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "80\u2019s Arbor Stiletto Headless Electric Guitar Trans Red", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Arbor"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Headless"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 152, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
