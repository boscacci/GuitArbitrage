{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 1964 Barney Kessel Regular Model. The \u201cRegular\u201d models were only made for two years 63 and 64...in 64 only 141 were produced making this a truly rare jem. The serial number is 175077. This is one of the last with a book matched arched spruce top with very vibrant intact Cherry Burst finish. I mention this because quite a few have the dye draw out of the cherry. Not this one!! This was also one of the first with the very sought after small neck heel that joins at the 17th fret opposed to the earlier ones that joined at the 14th fret. It is a 17\u201d long scale beauty with a 1 11/16 nut. They got slimmer soon after. For players this is the ideal year for this model. Now let\u2019s get down to nuts and bolts. This one is AMAZING!! The flame maple on the sides is unbelievable! Very thick and active tiger stripes. The maple back has a lot of activity as well, it is almost a plain top in some light and angles but comes alive in others. I have tried to capture in pics but they don\u2019t do it justice. All original down to every screw. The pickups are pictured, one patent number sticker and one blank however still very original. Anyone who knows PAF\u2019s and Patent # pickups know these early ones are basically the same. This jewel still has a full set of unopened shielding cans for the controls. Original gold reflector cap knobs, original wide bevel pickguard, wide bevel Bell cover. It has the original kluson keys that are still very, very clean and the gears are as tight as new and hold tune remarkably. Original Brazilian rosewood adjustable bridge. It\u2019s all there and in unbelievable condition. A few bumps here and there, a few small nicks but still a solid 9 of 10 in my opinion. Original case is also in great shape. This is a real find for the Gibson jazz player or Gibson collector alike. You will be blown away once you get it in your possession and lay you hands and eyes on it FOR SURE!!", "ItemID": "132898237503", "EndTime": "2018-12-27T02:29:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T18:02:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1964-Gibson-Barney-Kessel-Regular-Guitar-/132898237503", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Leonard, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328982375038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i5YAAOSwtida3MjE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vaMAAOSwo1pa3Mpm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HeEAAOSwx4xa3MqU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EJwAAOSw-YZa3MrY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzA5WDUwMg==/z/FP8AAOSwv4Fa3Msk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDIyWDU2OQ==/z/~foAAOSw2QJa3Mso/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Rp0AAOSwyCla3M00/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6KgAAOSwFqNa3MzP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QhAAAOSwVaZa3Mxy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JpEAAOSw2u1a3Mvz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5iIAAOSwVGha3M7S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1dwAAOSwvMFa3M-Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "75452", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "athasaxes", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1080, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 166}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1964 Gibson Barney Kessel Regular Guitar ", "HitCount": 69, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
