{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2011 Fender Pawn Shop '72 in Surf Green. Semi-hollow Strat-style body with an f-hole. Tele-style neck and headstock. I'm listing it as \"used\" because I'm not a dealer, but it's in like-new condition. This was bought new for my collection that I'm now downsizing. It's been stored in an air conditioned, smoke-free home since purchased. The guitar is \"Crafted in Japan\", serial number T012075. It still has the protective film on the pickguard. It was professionally set up for low actionwhen I purchased it. The pictured tweed hard shell case is included The shipping rate shown is good only within the \"lower 48 states\" and includes insurance. Here's information about the guitar from the Musician's Friend website: The Pawn Shop series instruments draw inspiration from strange and storied pawn shop finds of the 1960s and \u212270s, and emerge as all-new Fender guitars with a bold element of eccentricity \u201dguitars that never were but could have been\". The Pawn Shop Fender \u212272 has a semi-hollow Stratocaster\u00ae body with an f-hole, a Telecaster\u00ae style neck, two humbucking pickups, and dual-knob chrome control plate with mastervolume and pickup blend-a creative alchemy of diverse Fender components.
