{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful Ibanez George Benson LGB30 hollow-body jazz guitar. Great tone for jazz, blues, rockabilly, etc. This instrument is set up beautifully with a straight neck and smooth action and plays wonderfully. The wood grain in the spruce top is beautifully rippled and the tiger-striping on the maple back speaks for itself. It has never left my smoke free home and has always been stored in the original high quality Ibanez hard-shell case (included). There are no electrical issues or playing issues with this guitar. Two minor things of note, there is a small rub on the back where my strap touched the body at the strap pin, and there is a small line in the clear coat just above the bridge that has always been there since I purchased it. Neither are deeper than the clear coat, and barely noticeable. Check the photos please. Also included is the original owners manual, the optional wood saddle and hardware, and the neck adjustment wrench. I'm selling at a very reasonable price, I need money for tuition or else I would keep it. As you know, these are stunning, positively reviewed guitars that sell for well over $1000 new. Ibanez builds high quality guitars and always has.Take a close look, watch some YouTube videos and please ask all questions before you bid. Lower 48 states only please. Free shipping and PayPal only, will ship as soon as PayPal receives funds. No returns.
