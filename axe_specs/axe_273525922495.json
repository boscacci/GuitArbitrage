A master of melody, layering and texture, Marr has brought his own instantly identifiable genius to the proceedings ever since, in stints with The The, the Pretenders, Modest Mouse and the Cribs\u2014to say nothing of his solo career and innumerable guest appearances. The Johnny Marr Jaguar is a fantastically non-standard model that is as distinctive as the sounds he wrings from it.

Custom Neck ProfileIn an especially authentic touch, the neck on this signature model has a comfortably broken-in custom profile (the shape of the neck in cross section) based directly on Marr\u2019s 1965 Jaguar.\u2028 Bare Knuckle Single Coil PickupsFor specially voiced tone worthy of such an inventive and versatile guitarist, this Jaguar is built with \"Bare Knuckle\" Johnny Marr single-coil custom-wound neck and bridge pickups.
