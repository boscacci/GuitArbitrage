{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Squire Stratocaster SSS Condition is Used. Shipped with Expedited Shipping This is my favorite of all my squire strats as it is made so well. It has a nice thin neck and plays so well.The Squire Standard models made in Indonesia were made with so much more attention to detail. I am the second owner and I have taken extremely good care of it. Comes with a gig bag and will be very well packed.This guitar is hands down the best squire strat I have ever owned. The maple neck has some nice slight aging to the color. All 3 pickups are the SCN(Samarium cobalt noiseless) pickups that came with guitar originally.The SCN logo is on the pickups. They have a nice rich tone. I hate to part with this one but its time to start reducing my guitar collection.US sales only, Paypal only and you will absolutely LOVE this guitar.I ship same day or next day after payment is made.I hope a real guitar lover/player gets to be the new owner..Never been on the road, only played here in studio.You won't be disappointed!!...She's a beauty!!
