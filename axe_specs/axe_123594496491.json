{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is not the cheaper Squier version. These are a discontinued collector\u2019s items. I had Mike Koontz at Koontz Guitar Repair in Ferndale set this up. He does work for famous artists like Kid Rock and Rod Stewart when they come to town, so least to say, he has it playing smoother and better than out of the box. Seymour Duncan invader pickup is massive and fat sounding. If you know what you\u2019re doing with your amp you can dial in the classic blink tone or you can drop the tuning and shred some metal. Couple marks on top of guitar which I included in picture. I also had Koontz Guitar Repair put strap locks in. The top one is a little loose, (zoomed in on 3rd picture), but I still play it standing upright and you could fill that in easily if you want to. Will include hard carrying case with guitar.", "ItemID": "123594496491", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T23:09:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T18:13:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Tom-DeLonge-Stratocaster-Surf-Green-/123594496491", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Detroit, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235944964918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/amoAAOSwW4tcPM9U/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J0oAAOSwLX5cPM9q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/T5kAAOSwptZcPM93/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48207", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "balloonknot725", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 11, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 289}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Tom DeLonge Stratocaster- Surf Green\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Artist Series"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Surf Green"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 66, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
