{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Steinberger Spirit GT-Pro Standard Electric Guitar Steinberger Spirit GT-Pro Standard I don\u2019t think they make this model anymore, with the single-coil in the neck position. This comes with the original Steinberger Spirit gig bag (dusty), tremolo arm, large and small adjustment allen wrenches, and a hard case that isn\u2019t really a guitar case. The hard case is a Game Winner case for a take-down double barrel shotgun, but it works great for this guitar. I bought this a few years ago, to have a full-scale travel guitar, but it seems like I never have room to take a guitar with me or time to play it when I travel, so I have hardly used it. Condition: Excellent. Only noticeable scratch is on the back, near the strap button \u2013 may be a scratch of just a black scuff mark from something black rubbing across it. Plastic still on the rear cover plate. I have tested it to make sure there is no scratchiness in the pots or static in the switch \u2013 sounds like brand new. The manual with it is actually for a Steinberger Synapse and the 3 extra sets of string are years old (older than the guitar) so I wouldn\u2019t count on them to be good replacements. The guitar is in great shape and plays and sounds great.", "ItemID": "332977275848", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T00:00:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-26T00:00:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Steinberger-Spirit-GT-Pro-Standard-Electric-Guitar-/332977275848", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Frankfort, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329772758488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg0WDEzMTk=/z/vHoAAOSwA3xcInxy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc1WDExNzA=/z/dBQAAOSwq6VcInx-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODcwWDE0NzI=/z/SmYAAOSwhrpcInyG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzczWDEwMzA=/z/d0cAAOSwPg9cInyP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzE4WDExODA=/z/jGgAAOSwjoFcInyU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk0WDE0MDk=/z/3LYAAOSw5i5cInya/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTg2WDEyMjA=/z/XgoAAOSwmvpcInyh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDg2WDEwMjA=/z/QE0AAOSwkHFcInyu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "40601", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "brenn0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1193, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 265.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 265.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 231}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Steinberger Spirit GT-Pro Standard Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["GT Pro Standard"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Steinberger"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["GTPROSBK1"]}]}, "HitCount": 191, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 270.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78631289", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Only noticeable scratch is on the back, near the strap button \u2013 may be a scratch of just a black scuff mark from something black rubbing across it.
