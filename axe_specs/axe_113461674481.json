{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling an\u00a0AMAZING Custom Parker Fly Deluxe - sounds glorious, looks fantastic: It came from the factory as an emerald green \"pre-refined\" Fly Deluxe - original\u00a0electronics and pickups were removed, and it was upgraded with: 1) Vintage Vibe P-90 single coil bridge pickup\u00a0 2) Vintage Vibe Charlie Christian single coil blade magnet neck pickup 3) Fishman Powerchip piezo system with stereo jack 4) Free-way 6-way pickup switch (think of it as 2 3-way selectors, one tilted on left side, one tiled on right side) provides you with neck pickup, neck and\u00a0bridge in parallel in phase, bridge pickup, and both pickups in series in phase, both pickups in series out of phase, and both pickups in\u00a0parallel out of phase. I will include the custom wiring diagram. 5) Controls are master magnetic volume, master magnetic tone, bridge pickup\u00a0volume (this helps provide variations of sound when bridge pickup is selected along with neck pickup), piezo volume, 6-way as listed above, and a piezo/both/magnetic selector switch (original Parker Fly issued part). 6) Custom knobs. Incredible sounding\u00a0and looking Custom Fly with very cool custom pickups. Wired specifically for this Fly to have a great tonal range from warm vintage to big bold rock tones.
