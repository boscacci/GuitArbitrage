{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a light-aged Bill Nash S-67 large headstock Strat-style guitar with 3-tone sunburst, Alder body, Lollar Strat Special pickups, and fatback maple neck with 6100 frets. The headstock has a sticker of the Japanese god of thunder Raijin. This is a gorgeous guitar with perfect worn-in feeling, lightly aged by the man, Bill Nash. I bought it in 2009 and gently played it only a few times throughout the years. It's like a closet classic of a closet classic! The frets have absolutely minimal wear, if any. Never gigged. No issues with play-ability at all. Setup remains as Bill shipped it. Strings with super-low action. All marks and dings are only from Bill Nash's handiwork. Nash guitar case included. Please send me any questions. Happy Bidding!", "ItemID": "283275222079", "EndTime": "2018-12-01T22:02:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-25T02:30:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Bill-Nash-Strat-style-S-67-God-Thunder-3-tone-Sunburst-Light-Relic-/283275222079", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Glendora, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832752220798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/p9sAAOSwVRBb7ntc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/E9cAAOSweX5b7ntv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/D8sAAOSw-rxb7nt9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91741", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "robceb11a", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 224, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1170.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1170.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 542}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Bill Nash Strat-style S-67 God of Thunder 3-tone Sunburst Light Relic", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 74, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1195.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
