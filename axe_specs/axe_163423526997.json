{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Squier's Vintage Modified '72 Telecaster Thinline evokes the popular second incarnation of that era's stylish Tele model. The original late-'60s version was updated in 1972 to include two great-sounding Wide Range humbucking pickups for a distinctive sound and personality, and that's exactly what Squier gives you here, along with gorgeous semi-hollow aesthetics and smooth playability. FEATURES Semi-hollow ash body with \"F\" hole Maple neck with \"C\"-shaped profile and 21-fret maple fingerboard Dual Wide Range humbucking pickups with three-way switching White pearloid pickguard Strings-thru-bodyTelecaster bridge with six stamped saddles I bought this guitar 2 years ago and have barely played it due to being too busy. But the guitar plays incredibly and has a beautiful sound. No scratches, dents, or wear. Sad to see it go but need to make some room for the Christmas season. It still has the original strings from Guitar Center (obviously I can throw in a fresh set of Ernie Balls)On Dec-11-18 at 16:54:52 PST, seller added the following information: I WILL SHIP THE ITEM!
