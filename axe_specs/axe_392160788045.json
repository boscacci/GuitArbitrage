{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding decided to offer this at a $.01 start true auction instead of a buy it now and let the market determine its value-- i called Gibson and after awhile found a sales tech who told me these are very rare--in the shop he said they refer to them as the Ghost or the Angel-- the light maple board with the pale natural top is over the top unusual and beautiful--i never really cared for the maple neck on the black Customs like they did in the late 70s but on a natural wood body--which is chosen for the quality of the grain because then it doesn't need a finish applied--it is surreal--and the mahogany on the back as you can see from the last scan is also stunning-- But really the guitar is a rock and roll and blues and metal maniac--it completely changes personality when plugged in--from a rather refined looking--almost delicate shy beauty it turns into a true legend from the very first licks--really--this is a professional guitar that will increase and broaden any player's tonal palette. It's also a Custom Shop Edition--comes with the original truss rod wrench and the paperwork/combo for the case--it is authentic and rare-- the front is almost mint--a bit of tarnishing on the hardware--the back has a slight amount of nearly invisible worming in one small spot but is otherwise excellent--the neck is perfect and the action is low with great frets and no buzzing Any apparent anomalies seen in the photos are from reflections--the finish is still so bright and reflective it was hard to get subtle lighting even in the shade.Weight of Guitar: 9 1/2 lbs please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value--i will not make money on shipping--ever-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392160788045", "EndTime":
