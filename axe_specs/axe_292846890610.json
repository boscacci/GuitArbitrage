{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1965 Gretsch 6117 Double Anniversary Hollowbody Electric GuitarSelling my 1965 Gretsch 6117 Double Anniversary Hollowbody electric guitar. The guitar is pretty original except for one replacement tuner peg, the period correct leather aftermarket strap, and a replacement pickup switch. I had it looked over and setup by the guys at Guitar Repair of Tampa. They replaced the strings, polished the chrome, adjusted the bridge, oiled the body, cleaned the fret board, and also cleaned out the pots and master volume control. The guitar sounds awesome and looks the parts as well. There are a few issues that they identified that I want to make known: The guitar (at some point in its life) was neglected. Due to this it picked up a slight twist in the neck which can be seen in one of the pictures. The guitar is still super playable but it makes for a slightly lower action on the high E string. The fret board looks like it has been removed and repaired at some point by a non-professional. There is also a hairline crack that runs up most of the back of the neck. The guys at the shop said that it is fine and should be left alone since it does not run through the peg head. The binding is starting to get brittle in a few areas and has flaked off as seen in a few pictures. The body is in great shape apart from one small split where the tail piece is anchored. The top and back are gorgeous. The peg head has some checking in the finish but is not cracked. Other than the above mentioned issues, this guitar is awesome for anyone who is looking for a sweet sound from a real vintage guitar. I would consider this guitar to be in fair condition. The guitar wears its scars well which only adds intrigue into its 53 years of history. The guitar comes with a nice non-original hard shell case. I can send more pictures of specific things on request. Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have. These guitars in good condition are selling between $2100-$2500 and over $3000 in excellent condition. The guys at Guitar Repair of Tampa said that for $400-$600 they could fix the issues, which would put this guitar in the good condition category making its value well over $2000. I am willing to deliver within a few hundred miles of Central Florida for the shipping price.
