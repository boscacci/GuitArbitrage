{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FENDER JAPAN STRATOCASTER ST62-TX OCR 2015 JD-SERIAL Serial #: JD15005697 Wow! Check out this Fender Japan ST62-TX Strat! Old Candy Apple Red finish w/3ply mint pickguard. Alder body and USA Texas Special pickups! It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few small marks on it here and there nothing that I would call significant and overall I'd say that it's in fine shape! Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the body and neck are only camera flash and light reflection. Neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard no problem with play. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic as these do! Loads of cutting edge attack and drive with the alder body and Texas Specials! I found this one to be a great player! If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Comes w/Fender gigbag and tremelo arm. Shipping inside of the USA is $45 by USPS Priority Mail which is registered, insured, and trackable. Please allow 2 to 3 days for delivery.
