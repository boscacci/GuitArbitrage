It was manufactured in 1982. It was made 36 years ago. I sold a lot of the electric guitars in eBay. And I always feel so. Vintage Greco and vintage Aria proII and vintage Epiphone japan are very similar. Vintage Tokai and vintage Burny are very similar. However, I feel Yamaha is not similar to any brand. YAMAHA is characteristic. This is a very old YAMAHA Les Paul type. I always think about the all old YAMAHA. I think the quality of wood is high anyway. It can consistently say to the old YAMAHA. That can be said for low price SL-380 too. High quality wood is used for this SL-450S. I think that you can understand immediately. Making is polite anyway. Current, Some High end model guitars are made in Japan, but others are produced in Yamaha's own factory in China. It may be the cause, but currently in Japan, Yamaha's electric guitar is not popular. This is a Yamaha guitar of a very popular era. Produced by Kasuga musical instrument manufacture. Kasuga musical instrument manufacture was producing acoustic guitar, banjo, violin. Representative brands are \"Heerby\" \"ELECTRA\" \"Gaban\" \"Ganson\" \"RK Herby\" \"The KASUGA\" etc. Currently, it is all evaluated as Japan Vintage. This SL-450S has dignity of vintage guitar. About guitar play, Current state, the space between the strings and the frets is standard. I think the pickups is excellent ! I feel very good distortion sound. Of course, Clean sound is very well. I recommend Heavy Metal Music or Hard Rock music !! This SL-450S has dignity of vintage guitar. Old YAMAHA is Great !! It is cleanliness. I polished with guitar exclusive polish, so it is in a very clean state. I after the finger board cleaning, painted beeswax. The aim is moisturizing and and protection. Current neck condition, very good ! roughly straight ! There is no problem with the Truss rod and it can be adjusted. Remaining the frets are 74% on average. You can play immediately after it is delivered to you. I was set new strings. Regular tuning. ( Inch : 009, 011, 016, 024, 032, 042 ) All is working well. It is in a very good condition.
