{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered for your consideration we have a super clean, 2000 Gibson Les Paul Classic Gold Top. Plays great, sounds even better. Overall in excellent plus condition, showing very little play wear, considering it's a 19 year old instrument. I believe the previous owner installed the pick up covers and changed the pick up rings as well. Although, the original pick up rings are included. Killer guitar!! The original hard shell case is included. It appears a previous owner forgot the combo, and had to \"break into\" the lock on the case. So, it's been somewhat repaired as shown. The case and latches still functions properly. JUST FOR FUN, THIS BE AN OLD SCHOOL, NO RESERVE AUCTION.
