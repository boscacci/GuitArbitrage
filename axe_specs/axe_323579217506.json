{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "G&L INVADER , CUSTOM SHOP MADE GUITAR. THIS GUITAR DOES NOT HAVE A SERIAL NUMBER. I BELIEVE THIS WAS A EMPLOYEE MADE GUITAR. THE BODY APPEARS TO BE MAHOGANY WITH A 1/8\" CAP OF SPALTED FLAMED MAPLE. THE NECK IS NICELY FIGURED MAHOGANY WITH A EBONY FINGERBOARD AND NO FRET MARKERS EXCEPT BLACK ONES AT THE 12TH FRET. THE FINISH IS RED BURST AND LIGHT RED BURST. THE NECK HAS A SATIN FINISH AND THE BODY HAS A GLOSS FINISH. ON THE NECK HEAL AND IN THE NECK PICKUP CAVITY ARE HAND WRITTEN FINISHING DETAILS AND POSSIBLY THE PERSONS NAME THE GUITAR WAS BUILT FOR OR THE PERSON WHO FINISHED THE GUITAR. THE PICKUPS ARE SEYMOUR DUNCAN STK-S1N IN THE NECK POSITION AND SEYMOUR DUNCAN SH-1B IN THE BRIDGE. THE TUNERS ARE SPERZEL. ALL CONTROLS, PICKUPS, TUNERS, JACK, SWITCH, BRIDGE, ETC WORK GREAT WITH NO ISSUES. THE GUITAR IS IN VERY GOOD COSMETIC CONDITION . THE GUITAR DOES HAVE A FEW SMALL DINGS, FINISH MARKS IN THE FINISH FROM NORMAL PLAYING AND CLEANING, SOME WEAR TO THE BRIDGE FINISH FROM PLAYING. THE FRETS ARE STICKING OUT PAST THE FINGERBOARD FROM SHRINKAGE BUT ARE STILL COVERED BY THE NECK FINISH AND THERE IS ALSO FINISH MISSING AT THE END OF THE NUT. THE GUITAR DOES PLAY WELL WITH COMFORTABLE ACTION BUT, THE NECK HAS VERY LITTLE RELIEF. THE NECK HAS ONLY A SINGLE ACTION TRUSS ROD. THERE IS VERY SLIGHT BUZZING IN POSITIONS 1-4 WHEN PLAYING AND COULD BENEFIT FROM HEAVIER GAUGE STRINGS. THIS GUITAR IS LISTED AS A PROJECT BECAUSE THE NECK NEEDS SOME WORK. THIS IS A VERY NICE GUITAR AND WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO ORDER FROM THE G&L CUSTOM SHOP TODAY. THE GUITAR COMES WITH THE ORIGINAL G&L HARD CASE. THE SHIPPING PRICE IS LOWER 48 USA ONLY. OTHER LOCATIONS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. SELLER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO RE-LIST THE ITEM IF NOT PAID WITHIN 3 DAYS OF END OF AUCTION. NO ITERNATIONAL SHIPPING. ITEM IS SOLD AS-IS.", "ItemID": "323579217506", "EndTime": "2018-12-09T15:57:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T15:57:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-L-INVADER-CUSTOM-SHOP-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-USA-SEYMOUR-DUNCAN-SPERZEL-PROJECT-/323579217506", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235792175068080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4N1g0ODg=/z/gXsAAOSwqnVb8Xr7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/fFkAAOSwolpb8Xsl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/RVoAAOSwIw1b8Xs~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/fp4AAOSwHjtb8X1S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4Y0AAOSwzd9b8Xt4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/kyUAAOSw~2Vb8Xub/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/C6EAAOSwlfNb8XvZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ACIAAOSwvYRb8XwD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/YBwAAOSwUm5b8XyO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/jC8AAOSwHORb8Xy0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/1doAAOSwZUFb8X1A/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2MzQ=/z/rBIAAOSwYUZb8X7N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "89131", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kasvegas145u3", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 748, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 364}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G&L INVADER CUSTOM SHOP ELECTRIC GUITAR, USA, SEYMOUR DUNCAN, SPERZEL, PROJECT.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple", "Ash"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 240, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 320.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78630529", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
