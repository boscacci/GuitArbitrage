{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I do ship international. Available here is your chance to finally own an awesome Waylon-style leather-covered Telecaster! Here is a 2013 Fender American Special Telecaster that I have covered with one of my custom, hand-tooled Western-style Waylon covers. The cover is made from Hermann Oak premium leather and then hand-tooled and laced by me. I put many hours in the detail and visual appeal. The guitar is a Fender Facotry original American Special Telecaster. The specs are: Maple neck with \"C\" profile9.5\"-radius maple fingerboard with 22 jumbo fretsDual Texas Special\u2122 single-coil Telecaster pickupsThree-way pickup switchGreasebucket\u2122 tone circuit (rolls off highs without adding bass)Vintage-style string-through-body Telecaster bridge with three brass saddlesA very high-end Fender Tele with USA components! The cover is brand new and completed about a week ago. It is set up with .010 gauge strings and sounds and plays incredible. The look is pretty self-explanatory. Pay close attention to the photos to appreciate the attention to detail and depth of the tooling work. I also installed a Schaller Banjo D-Tuner for the low E string, just like Waylon's. This particular Waylon cover is a bit different from the typical black and white color option. It's also the \"Dukes Of Hazzard\" pattern (the one found on the Tele he plays in the intro of the TV show). This one is a 3-color cover. It features a light blue base color, instead of black. I also added what I call the \"Worn Waylon\" look, where I purposely added a smoke black stain gel to enhance the tooling detail and it gives the cover a sort of worn-in look as opposed to the typical super-white pattern. It is still white, but the smoky gel makes it look very cool, with almost a vintage appearance. It even has the same effect to the back's detail. I must admit, I prefer this look over the all-white version. The back features a bookend variation of the front with the Fender logo behind it in silver! This one is very unique! I used black lace and the black/whie/black original pickguard to tie-in the whole color scheme. It really stands out! I also sell these on a commission basis. This is a chance to get one already made! It's also outfitted with an exquisitely detailed leather cover that will help increase it's value! You will be hard-pressed to find a Tele like this, with this much detail in the leatherwork, for this price. Most covers like this will run you $1500-$2500 for the cover alone. A Fender Deluxe Gig Bag is included. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to do so. Shipping in the USA is FREE!
