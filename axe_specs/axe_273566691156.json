{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Again, this is what you hope to find when you come to Ebay. This is a Fleck semi-hollow electric guitar with one volume control and two tone control knobs. In the second picture you will see a top vent on the guitar which allows for unreal tones to be heard. If you Google Michael Fleck you will see he ran his own guitar building and repair shop for 21 years in Anchorage, Alaska! He would occasionally make guitars and when he did he skipped on nothing. This guitar looks and sounds incredible. I feel in love with it the first time I saw this guitar several years ago. Like many guitar players, I go back to the same 3/4 guitars and I'm just not playing this beauty. I paid $3,900 for this custom one off. I know I'll never get anything close to that but, this guitar deserves to be played and enjoyed by someone. ***If you are interested, please make an offer.
