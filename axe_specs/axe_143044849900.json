{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a stunning and very rare 1995 Fender Stratocaster special edition made in Mexico. These guitars were only made for 3 years and are very hard to come by. They are much nicer than standard MIM strats. This one is all original and is in near mint condition with the only imperfection being 3 small dents at the very top of the headstock. It\u2019s as if it was saved in a time capsule and unopened until now. It hasn\u2019t been played for the last 15 years and has been well kept in a hard case. Strings have been replaced but as any older and used gear, could/should use a set up to fit your specifications. Neck is very straight. It was made in 1995 which is the Golden year for MIM Fender and was made in the Ensenada factory. I purchased this from the original owner. The pickup configuration is HSS with a switch instead of tone knob, which is factory and sounds amazing. Great collectors and players guitar. The hard case has seen better days but case interior is great and latches closed. This case is not the original hard case. The color is stunning. It\u2019s an aged white/cream color and shows wood grain through the paint. Some have called the color \u201cwhite burst\u201d. This is the rarest color combination. Most come in black or with maple fretboards. White with rosewood fretboards are almost never on the market, considering these were only available for 3 years and the least produced color combination. These guitars retailed for over $600 new and are only worth more now. Please bid with confidence. I have detailed and photographed this guitar to the best of my ability. Please see photos. Returns are not accepted as this is a vintage guitar with parts that are easily replaced, swapped and removed. Happy bidding!", "ItemID": "143044849900", "EndTime": "2018-12-15T22:25:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-08T22:25:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-1995-Fender-Stratocaster-Special-MIM-near-Mint-/143044849900", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Santa Clarita, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430448499008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FxIAAOSwvfpcDEJt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iqkAAOSw0EpcDEJo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3OFgxNjAw/z/MmgAAOSwnCdcDEJj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QaAAAOSwtcRcDEJw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-GkAAOSwlLlcDEJy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDMw/z/McoAAOSwoDFcDEJh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RxMAAOSwo1lcDEJ0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/r~4AAOSwVEFcDEJq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/w2QAAOSwztVcDEJ2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BBYAAOSwsRVcDEpY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/egwAAOSwHSdcDEpq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkwWDE2MDA=/z/60oAAOSwgbdcDEJu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91390", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "janewalch", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 21, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 18, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 404.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 404.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 231}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rare 1995 Fender Stratocaster Special MIM near Mint", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1995"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Special Edition"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 871, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 409.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
