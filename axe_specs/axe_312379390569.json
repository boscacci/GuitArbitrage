{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "PLEASE, Read the ENTIRE auction! Very Good Condition - played very little, I know there are some slight player blemishes, nothing major with exception to pictured ding, but take that into account. Sounds and plays good. You can get a lot of unique sounds, 24 inch scale, hardtail, Play as is or set up to taste. Hate to let it go but I'm getting married. It has the the kind of weird Jaguar switching demos all over youtube, All electronics could use cleaning. It is a 9 out of 10 and the case is a 9 of 10. GREAT Guitar. A little hard to come by. I believe it is the Japan model, but will have to check. Returns only for gross misrepresentations.
