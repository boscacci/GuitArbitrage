{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are bidding here on Jeff Shepherd's (from Sheptone pickups) personal, custom-built 1956 Strat replica. I picked it up from him when I was living back in Seattle, running a studio there. Custom wound pickups specifically outfitted to this guitar, by Shep himself. He went so far as to tell me he designed/wound them specifically to go with the maple neck/fretboard, a little different than his stock Strat pickups. He described them to me as essentially \"hot vintage\"... Quoting his explanation to me, \"they are 7K plus with formvar wire. That would be in the neighborhood of 9000 turns or 12% over vintage. The N/M are proportionally wound for position, it\u2019s just what I do. There is a Callaham steel plate on the bridge too...\" He actually at my request wound a more vintage set, but after replacing the bridge pickup and comparing the tone, I realized \"okay yeah, he's the expert...\" The ones he wound for this specific guitar just sing... Roll the volume back and get beautiful vintage woody Strat tones, and put it to 10 and try to out-Clapton yourself... Great tones. (Paired with our 1963 non-verb Fender Deluxe, this was one of the favorite recording setups in our studio!) He had a friend and luthier from British Columbia actually build the guitar itself, and it's gorgeous... The neck is sort of a cross between a \"U\" and a \"soft-C\"... A bit on the shallow side but with with nice, deep curvature where it meets the fretboard. Beautiful relic'ing... It LOOKS like a 1956 Fender would... The nickel and chrome all really turned out fantastic looking. Comes with the trem arm, but no back plate (same as how I got it). Just a great guitar. Sad to see it go, but I'm not really a Strat guy and this was a purchase for our studio collection (which is being sold off - check our other auctions for a rare 1975 Gibson Les Paul in natural, with mahogany neck and body). Comes with a brand new G&G brown \"vintage-style\" case, that was only purchased for a move to the east coast, then stored away. Still has the key. Happy bidding! >>>Keep an eye out for other guitars and amps coming up for sale soon, all from our studio collection: 1966 Gibson ES-330 (sunburst)... 1975 Fender P-bass (sunburst), 1968 Epiphone Rivoli bass (sunburst)... 1937 Recording King Class-A 6L6 combo amp (Charlie Christian special - mahogany cabinet)... 1963 Fender Deluxe non-reverb amp... 1954 Fender Tweed Deluxe...<<<", "ItemID": "283312245504", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T16:03:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T16:03:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1956-Fender-Stratocaster-Strat-replica-Sheptones-own-custom-built-guitar-/283312245504", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833122455048080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Tq8AAOSwdrdcHQqL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J-UAAOSwkDtcHQql/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UdUAAOSwAopcHQlv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4LIAAOSwdUJcHQrE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/a-UAAOSwRs5cHQrf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MksAAOSwG25cHQq0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/l-wAAOSw5i5cHQrm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fG4AAOSwlfNcHQlh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g-IAAOSwCWNcHQlj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ka8AAOSwnWpcHQll/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "20902", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "vintagepop", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1292, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 677.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 677.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 925}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1956 Fender Stratocaster/Strat replica - Sheptone's own custom built guitar", "HitCount": 241, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 687.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
