{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This SG was made in Korea 10/97 it seems the best of these Korean Epiphone SGs were made around this time. The guitar was in such clean condition a massive upgrade was made to the electronics a brand new set of Probuckers were put in with the complete harness and the coil splitting pots pull the volume knob up for single coil sound push it down for full probucker sound. The neck was straightened leveled crowned and polished than cleaned and oiled. New D'Addario NY XL !0/46 strings were added and then there was a complete setup done and it plays and sounds amazing This guitar will be wrapped well for shipping in a real nice gig Bag for extra protection. Please look at the Pictures any questions Just ask. Thanks for Looking!
