{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for bid is this 2007 Gibson Les Paul Classic Electric Guitar, Heritage Cherry Sunburst finish w/Bigsby tremolo tailpiece. Comes with original hard shell case. As seen in the pictures, this guitar has a few nicks & dings. Make sure you want this guitar before bidding since there are NO RETURNS. I can't be paying shipping to someone who thinks this guitar will look new. This is a used guitar, 11 years old. The Bigsby tailpiece is not factory installed. I installed it as I have with several other on my guitars. All electronics work fine. Guitar has great action so plays nice. Any questions, feel free to ask. I am only selling because I need money to pay my year end property taxes, & I have several other guitars to play. Overstocked in Les Pauls. This is a 1960 style guitar, neck & body type. Shipping only to the lower 48 United States. Thanks for looking. Free local pickup. Save the shipping fee.Will throw in a new set of GHS light guage .10 to .46 strings. ***** (Answers to previous questions) I do not see or know of any cracks or breaks & not aware of any repairs, although I have only owned this 11 year old guitar for a few years. There is a hole where the previous stop bar was. It is not covered. I replaced the previous bridge with the B-7 Bigsby tremolo. As advertised, there are nicks & dings, so this does not look like a new guitar. Make sure you are not searching for a new looking guitar. This guitar is nice, but does not look new. This guitar is being sold AS-IS, NO RETURNS.On Dec-02-18 at 12:25:07 PST, seller added the following information: It has been called to my attention that this guitar is a 2000, not a 2007, & that Gibson's serial number system changed on the Les Paul Classics. The serial number is shown on the picture of the back of the head of the guitar. I found one article that agrees with that, so selling this guitar as is, 2000 or 2007. You be the judge.
