{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Guitar Peak In the North Georgia Mountains 706-896-7738 678-314-1240 ***Fender 50s Telecaster w/ Bigsby*** We're offering this Fender 50s Telecaster w/ Bigsby in the gloss \"butterscotch\" Natural finish over a beautifully grained Ash body. These rare limited edition Crafted In Japan (CIJ) Telecasters were intended for the Japanese market only - not for export - and are no longer available new. Japanese Fenders, in this case made between 2004-2005, are high-end instruments considered by many to be equal to or better than the USA product. This Tele is no exception, with great vintage features throughout. They're much sought-after due to their vintage-specification design and excellent fit and finish. The 25.5\" scale one piece Maple neck/fingerboard, with Walnut \"skunk\" stripe, has 21 vintage frets and dot inlays. Dual vintage Tele pickups single coils deliver vintage tone with volume, tone and 3-way switch. The Natural finish is nicely set off by the all matte-black single ply pickguard. The neck profile is a soft V \u2014 not a baseball bat or exaggerated V profile. A comfortable union of the rounded U and a V profile that plays exceptionally well. The tuners are single line vintage style tuning keys and the Fender \"F\" logo Bigsby tremolo tops it all off. It's in very nice condition with a few tiny dings and very light surface scratches. Plays/sounds/looks great - a really beautiful Telecaster with killer tone and vibe. This model originally shipped without a case/bag from Fender but this one includes a good used Fender hardshell case. Please ask any and all questions by phone or e-mail before purchasing.
