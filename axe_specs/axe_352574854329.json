{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FENDER JAPAN STRATOCASTER ST57-66DMC BLK 2007 S-SERIAL Serial #: S008216 Wow! Check out this Fender Japan Dimarzio Collection ST57-66DMC Strat! Black finish w/1ply white pickguard. Maple fretboard and Dimarzio DCS-3 Full Range Impact pickups! It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few marks and scratches on it here and there nothing that I found that I would call very significantly major White glare areas on the body and neck are camera flash and light reflection. Neck is straight and in solid condition. Fretboard fine. Frets have some wear in a few spots nothing that I found to affect play in a majorly significant way but please take notice as it may bother some players. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds great! Plenty of cutting edge attack and and a fuller beefier than average tone with the DCS-3 pickups! If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Comes w/Fender gigbag and tremelo arm.
