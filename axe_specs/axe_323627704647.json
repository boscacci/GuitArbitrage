{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I know there are many who are quick to poo poo the Chinese made guitars. Rightfully so in many cases. The truth is that the Chinese have gotten a lot better at doing what they do. Is it a rip off of a great American guitar company? Of course. Do you get what you pay for? Not necessarily. Not everyone has $1600 to drop on a guitar. This one plays, feels and sounds really good! Finish and detailing are pretty great! Very bright twangy sounding pick ups. Nice condition with no wear, scratches or damage to speak of. Cool binding on body and neck. It\u2019s near new. Straight neck. The fender logo and custom shop on the head are not decals. They\u2019re under the clear coat and look good. I went ahead and sanded off the \u2018made in USA\u2019 from the head. That just wasn\u2019t right. Again, This is not a true USA Tele. No case. Ask ??
