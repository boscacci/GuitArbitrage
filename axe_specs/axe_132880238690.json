You are looking at a Vintage 1954 Gretsch 6186 Clipper Hollywood Hollow Body Archtop. This was the entry level Gretsch at that time. If a White Falcon was a Cadillac, the Clipper Hollywood was a Corolla. Paired with original chrome G pointer knobs and a slender 1 3/4\" body depth, this Clipper is a simple, straightforward, and surprisingly versatile vintage Gretsch. The tone is spanky and clear acoustically, and through the pickup there's a distinct twang to the top end and sweetness to the lows. The neck has a medium C shaped profile with a thick slab Brazilian rosewood fretboard, and original frets which are in excellent shape. The stock frets have plenty of meat and height left with well rounded crowns and virtually no wear. The bone nut measures a full 1 11/16\" in width and the headstock retains the original truss rod cover, \"Gretsch\" waterslide decal, and stock open gear tuning machines. These tuners turn smoothly, and hold pitch as they should. The simple electronics work well, and a pair of original Gretsch G pointer knobs. The original floating compensated bridge, chrome Gretsch tailpiece, and pickguard are present as well.The original Gretsch hardshell case with blue/gray speckled exterior is included. Even a original hang tag (case candy) is included. Our luthier did a complete setup. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Serial Number: #11721 Nut Width: 1.67\" Weight: 6.75 lbs.
