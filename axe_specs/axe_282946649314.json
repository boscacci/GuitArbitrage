{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Plays, sounds, and looks great. Not sure what kind of pickups are in it, I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019re super expensive but they sound very good. I have another SG-310, and I prefer the sound of this one. A few paint chips, cracks, and scratches here and there but from a few feet away guitar looks fantastic, The red really pops! There are cracks in the paint where the neck meets the body, but they do not effect playability whatsoever. In fact, this is the 3rd SG-310 I have owned and all 3 have had cracks so I don\u2019t think anything of it. Other than the blemishes, it\u2019s in good shape, very minimal buzzing even with moderately low action. I have pictures of all the little dings and cracks besides the other side of the neck pocket crack, but the side I have pictured is worse than the other. Any questions, shoot me a message.
