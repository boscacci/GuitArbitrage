{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx only,no post office boxes .I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone Custom Shop Limited Edition Les Paul Junior in a Gloss White finish with some nice upgrades. First I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on.Then I replaced the stock pickup with a nice Duncan Designed HB102 Humbucker pickup . Next I upgraded the tone control with a push/pull tone control so you split the humbucker to a single coil. I also upgraded the capacitor with a .015uf mylar film capacitor. Sometimes I change the caps and I don't hear a big difference, this time the change was quite noticable. Sounded very full on clean tones and has a nice snarl once you add some gain. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock.The guitar is in very good condition,just mild surface scratches. I replaced the cheapie closed back tuners and installed more vintage looking Kluson Style Tuners,[you can still see some of the holes left from the old tuner screw holes on the back of the headstock.]These tuners came frome from China so don't believe the logos on the back of the tuners. Guitar plays,looks,and sounds great! A classy looking guitar that wants to kick some butt. Guitar looks great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea of the condition. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody,instead of working. Most deliveries will require adult signature.
