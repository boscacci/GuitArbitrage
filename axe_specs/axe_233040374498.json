{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1979 IBANEZ ST100 Studio Guitar 24 Fret Set Neck Original Excellent Ibanez made some really great guitars in the 1970s and this is definitely one of them. It has an ash body, maple set neck, and a rosewood fretboard. The hardware is original and nickel plated. The tuners are the originals (Patent Pending) with adjustable tension. The humbucker pickups are very versatile. The Studio ST100 has very similar electronics and hardware to the AR Artist series guitars from the era. Condition is very good. Everything functions as it should and it plays great with low action. The frets are original and have light wear in the lower 3 frets. I'm not sure about the Treble/Bass trim ring on the pickup selector switch, but everything else is original. There are several chips in the clear finish around the edges, so be sure to check the pictures before you make an offer or buy it now. It is currently set up with .010 D'Addarios, but upon the request of the buyer, I will install a new set of strings, buyer's choice on gauge, optimize the setup and adjust the intonation with a strobe tuner prior to shipping. Check the photos to see the the excellent condition. Message me if you would like to see more pics. No case, but it will arrive safely. I have shipped 100's of guitars safely. All Sales are Final.
