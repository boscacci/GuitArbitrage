{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here's a chance to own a Player's grade 1983 Kramer Baretta! Original owner was an Eddie Van Halen nut! Guitar was previously taped up like Eddie's. Has long been removed but you can still see the lines up close. wouldn't come out in the pics.He also slightly enlarged the pickup cavity to slightly angle the treble side of the pickup away from the bridge,like Eddie did, to limit the treble. can be put back if you want. Pickup is a Seymour Duncan Invader. Sounds great and looks cool! The \"C\" in the serial # denotes 1983. Probably late in 83. Guitar has a im going to call a \"hairline\" coming from the locking nut hole. If you look,its there. NOT a concern!! The floyd is pegged all the way back. You can dive but not pull up. adjust it if you want! Frets are great! Slim neck on this one! Comes with the original case which is in Excellent condition! Has the case keys! Original bill of sale and Kramer hang tag included. Action is low,plays great but who knows when the last time it got a set up. thats up to you! Great guitar!", "ItemID": "264131015218", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T09:16:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-11T15:11:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1983-Kramer-Baretta-w-OHSC-/264131015218", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Phoenix, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641310152188080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zqAAAOSwmaJcOKgz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vqwAAOSwlINcOKkE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rjEAAOSwCXxcOKiT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/R0sAAOSwl7dcOKjW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mxYAAOSw~odcOKlN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PkgAAOSwsQJcOKlw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v9YAAOSworNcOKnl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zCgAAOSwhEhcOKo1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Zd0AAOSwLgpcOKpk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QG0AAOSwohVcOKrH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GTkAAOSwVN1cOKsG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5MUAAOSw6~pcOKtN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "85006", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "miked_heirguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1716, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1698.98, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1698.98, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 510}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "Europe", "CA", "JP", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1983 Kramer Baretta w/OHSC", "HitCount": 142, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Changed pickup.Hang tags,Original Bill of Sale!Case Keys!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
