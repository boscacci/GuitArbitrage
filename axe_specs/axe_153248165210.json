{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a really cool Chapman ML3 BEA guitar. There are a few minor scuffs but it is an excellent overall condition. The case has a few dings on the outside, but it does the job well. The plastic is still on the back plate. Plays great, sounds even better. You can't really find these things used because they haven't been on the market that long; so save yourself a bunch of money compared to a new one. Let me know if you have any questions. I will not ship internationally. On Nov-11-18 at 13:30:58 PST, seller added the following information: In regards to the scuffs, I can't really find anything on the front of the guitar that isn't as it was new. The back has some very minor belt rash. The bottom has a few pin head sized marks but I'm really having to zoom in to capture those in the picture. On whole, this is in excellent shape.", "ItemID": "153248165210", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T21:49:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-05T21:49:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Chapman-ML3-BEA-guitar-w-hard-shell-case-/153248165210", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Rustburg, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532481652108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gtoAAOSwszFb133n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wdsAAOSwRK9b133m/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PhYAAOSwA29b133l/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z5sAAOSwB5lb133m/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iZUAAOSwTVlb133m/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GskAAOSwG1Jb6J8M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZnQAAOSw9h9b6J8R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "24588", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "joshpsalm27", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 152, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 91}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Chapman ML3 BEA guitar w/ hard shell case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 302, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
