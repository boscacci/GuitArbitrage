Item Description The SCT-607B starts with a rather traditional shape, but then takes an abrupt turn into one of the most powerful guitars available for contemporary music styles. It's a seven-string guitar, with neck-thru-body construction at 27\" baritone scale. That means this instrument can handle extremely low tunings, while still maintaining the string tension needed for expressive playing and excellent tones. It offers a comfortable alder body and a three-piece maple neck, with an unadorned ebony fingerboard. Components on the STEF-T7B include a TonePros locking TOM bridge with string-thru-body design for excellent sustain, and a pair of versatile Fishman Fluence SRC Signature active pickups. Each pickup has multiple voicings; use the push-pull control on the volume knob to select the one you want. On the middle alnico pickup, push down for &ldquo;Modern Active&rdquo; tone or pull up for &ldquo;Modern Passive Attack&rdquo;.
