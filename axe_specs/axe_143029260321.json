{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This \u201872 Classic Thinline Reissue is extremely clean for a used guitar. First I\u2019ll tell you what it doesn\u2019t have: All the typical signs of wear of a player\u2019s guitar, like buckle rash, chips on the bottom or upper and lower bouts, scratches on the pickguard, simply doesn\u2019t have them. I took special care to keep it on a stand, or in the case at all times. I finger-pick, which is why even the pickguard is clean. The fit and finish is exceptional, looks almost like a new guitar with natural gloss finish, ash body, and maple neck. All original \u2018cept for the tuners, VGC overall, electronics work perfectly. The only imperfections are clearly shown in pictures #10, #11 and #12. #10 shows a couple small (1/8\u201d), shallow nicks on the very end of the headstock, which is unnoticeable from the front, and actually difficult to see at all unless you know they are there. Photo #11 shows some fret wear on the first 5 frets that a simple fret dressing should clean up, allowing you to really lower the action. Still, as is it plays beautifully with mid-low action. Photo #12 shows the holes left by upgrading the tuners to Fender brand locking tuners, which is a big improvement over the original \u201cashtray\u201d style tuners - probably the weakest original component. I bought it this way, and it\u2019s a shame the person who installed these didn\u2019t take the few minutes to fill the extra holes using the old \u201ctoothpick-fill-method\u201d detailed in several YouTube videos which would have completely fixed this strictly esthetic issue. Of course, the Fender branded locking tuners are the perfect upgrade, improves pitch stability, and makes for quick string changes. Let\u2019s see what else, there is minor rust on a few of the pickguard screws - I\u2019m reaching here - just going for full disclosure. I have describe the particulars of this instrument. You can read the gobs of online reviews about this model, all of which are stellar. Personally, I love it, it is my favorite electric, but I need the money and I am first and foremost an acoustic player, so this is a luxury that right now I can\u2019t afford. It needs to live with someone who will play and love her as much as I did. Enjoy! Comes with the pictured, old, beat up, yet completely serviceable, plywood and tolex case. All hinges and latches work, and the case will keep it safe during shipping. Way better than the cheap gig bag that comes with the new ones for $900. Disclosure: Preowned gear will have signs of use; including, but not limited to marks, scratches, scuffs, oxidation, dust, rust, etc. All sales final. No refunds. No returns. Unless it doesn't perform as described, in which case I will make it right. Just please contact me first.
