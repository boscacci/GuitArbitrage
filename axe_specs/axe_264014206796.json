{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I bought this new in 2015 it hasn\u2019t been played much as I am a drummer first! I have always played around with guitars so time to sell a couple. This was the first of the historic collection from Gibson. Where as they went back to everything built with this guitar as to 1959 correct build. Long tenure neck hide glue and on and on! As we all now know what went into these guitars. Also big bucks now too! This is a chance for someone to get a Beautiful guitar at a reasonable price. These are now getting new 7590.00 and on.On Nov-03-18 at 11:58:36 PDT, seller added the following information: Just thought I would add to it, ok one thing I really liked is Gibson went to the one piece fret board rose wood! Like all les Paul prior to that 13 historic build they used two pieces over lapped. Like if you want to make sure you are holding a real r9 in your hands is to check the dye it will be seeping into the plastic moldings all up and down the neck and body of the guitar. This ax just won\u2019t go out of tune and plays like no other. I have owned many les Paul\u2019s over the years and this one as all my bud\u2019s say is KEEPER! I hate letting this one go as I will miss it terribly..But it\u2019s time to let go. I have a few laying around. Maybe later on you might be auctioning on another of my ax\u2019s. Good luck on this one!", "ItemID": "264014206796", "EndTime": "2018-11-06T10:26:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-30T10:26:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2013-Gibson-Custom-Shop-Historic-Collection-1959-Vos-Les-Paul-Standard-/264014206796", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Palm City, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640142067968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NDI=/z/uUMAAOSw~jxb2Cjx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5XAAAOSwMO9b2Cjp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UuwAAOSwC9hb2Cj2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UBMAAOSwCtNb2Cjs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AugAAOSwRBVb2Cjw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/3vAAAOSwmUBb2Cju/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/d38AAOSwC~Bb2CkP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xLIAAOSwy2pb2Cj0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/avIAAOSwVYhb2Cj4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/daMAAOSwEVtb3MAw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34990", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bradandalfy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 213, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3506.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3506.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 574}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2013 Gibson Custom Shop Historic Collection 1959 Vos Les Paul Standard!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany", "Maple", "Rosewood"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Bourbon Burst"]}]}, "HitCount": 676, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 3556.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
