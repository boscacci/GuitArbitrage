{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "History:This guitar will make many players happy. I purchased it new in September 1992. The serial number on the neck indicates that it could have been manufactured either in 1991 or 1992 during the early years of Mexico production (rumored with some American parts back then, but uncertain). It has received very light practice use, and has never left the (clean and smoke-free) home for any public play. The weight is comfortable at around 7.4 pounds or so. Body:The body is in fine condition, with only a few scuff marks, which are probably quite difficult to see in the photos, and also very difficult to see in-person. Neck: The rosewood neck is in fine condition, smooth and straight, and with only minor blemishes. Frets are in good shape. Held onto body with four screws. Original Fender tuners. Electronics:All electronics function including switches and knobs. I typically kept it set at a volume of 10. If you are the type who will change volume with the knob continually, you may eventually want to replace its potentiometer as those don't last forever in this model. Shipping:I will ship it in the case shown, packed carefully with some foam for protection. The outside will be wrapped in some cardboard.
