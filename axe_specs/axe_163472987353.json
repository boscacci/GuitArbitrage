{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This 24 year old guitar is in very good (+) condition. I try to describe the condition and capture any/all defects as best as possible(please review pictures). There are some mild scratches, and a couple of cracks in the finish. Also, there are two~ 1/8\u201d diameter chips. One of them is onthe top of the guitar and one is on the side. This guitar still looks, feels, and plays great. The Body of this guitar is constructed from solid mahogany with a figured maple top, deep cutaways for easy access to the highest fret, special forearm and ribcage contours allowing reduced weight, proper balance, and maximum playing ease. The finish is polyester/urethane finish, which is mar and weather resistant. The select rock maple neck is crafted to provide unmatched rigidity and freedom from warpage. Additional reinforcement is provided with a steel torsion rod. The adjustable torsion rod features rolled threads for improved strength and freedom from breakage. The two humbucking pickups are tuned for maximum tonal response, as well as fully shielded and wax-dipped for ultra-low noise operations and resistance to microphonic feedback.
