{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Telecaster HMT 1990 * original hard-shell case included Fender, the HMT, or Heavy Metal Telecaster. The name and sleek black looks make it obvious what Fender was going for here; a Telecaster that appealed to the Metal scene of the late '80s and early '90s. With Grover tuners and a pair of humbuckers, this guitar is capable of some great metal sounds, but with the added style of a thinline body with an f-hole. As is the case with most Teles, this guitar is very versatile and is not limited to its named genre. The HMT thinline series was made in Japan in the early 90's. There was a steel string with piezo and silverLace Sensor, a nylon string with only a piezo, and fretted and fretless P-basses with silver Lace Sensor and piezo. On the steel string and bass, the controls are volume, TBX tone, and pan. The nylon string has volume and TBX tone. There is a for the preamp. The bodies are made of mahogany with a spruce top, although the bass in the picture below has a curly maple top (may be veneer, but not fotoflame). They are quite light and comfortable to wear around your neck all night.", "ItemID": "254009086248", "EndTime": "2018-12-09T19:54:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T19:54:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-HMT-1990-/254009086248", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "New York, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540090862488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gNwAAOSwNpRb8b~e/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c64AAOSwwZxb8b~f/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oTAAAOSwK5Fb8b~d/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQ2/z/8i0AAOSwcttb8b~Z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/iC8AAOSweXFb8b~X/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "10011", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sofiamalamute7", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 9, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 421.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 421.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 944}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster HMT 1990", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990"]}]}, "HitCount": 200, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 426.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
