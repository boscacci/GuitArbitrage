{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a used 2006/2007 First Act GarageMaster VW edition electric guitar. Each guitar was available only to those who purchased one of select Volkswagen's during the fourth quarter of 2006. You can see the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the back of the headstock. This promotion was originally the result of a collaboration with Volkswagen of America, Inc. for a guitar that would also be able to play through the car-audio system of some Volkswagen models. The guitar has the traditional Volkswagen logo and \"V Dub\" inlay, VW knobs, and a prominent blue indicator light for the on-board preamp. A small analog amp-modeling circuit is housed under the lower pickguard amid the tone and volume controls. This preamp is powered by a standard nine-volt battery housed in a snap-open plastic compartment in the back of the guitar. Augmenting the normal volume and tone controls are three sliding switches. They control preamp on/off (with an adjacent blue LED to indicate status), tone shift (treble cut/boost), and choice of output-clean or distortion. A separate master volume knob controls output only when the preamp is engaged.Pickup configuration 2 Alnico V humbuckersVolume control, tone control, 9-volt amp-modeling circuit, master volume control, distortion/clean switch, high boost/cut switch, preamp on/off switch, three-way pickup selector toggle switchItems included with this guitar: The hard to find 3 VW/First Act logo guitar picks-medium thickness, a Super-cool VW/First Act embroidered heavy-duty seat belt material guitar strap with leather ends and black VW/First Act embroidered padded nylon gig bag.
