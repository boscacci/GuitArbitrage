{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1999 DeArmond X-155 17 Inch Hollow Body Korea MIK w/USA Gold Tone Pus From the 1998-2001 Fender Owned Guild inspired DeArmond line of nicely done Korean made guitars with USA made pickups, in this case a copy of the Guild X-155 jazz box with Gold Tone humbuckers. These earlier (1998-2000) models have a wide vintage Guild like headstock with the double hump at the top and a Guild truss rod cover with model name on it. The later (2000-2001) guitars had a narrow Gretsch Duo Jet like headstock with a single hump at the top. Fender was developing it's relationship with Gretsch at the time and the Dearmond line reflected that. It's probably also why the DeArmonds were discontinued, as they competed with the Gretsch Electromatic line. 17 inches wide. 3 \u00bc inches thick at the bindings. 4 inches at the center. Laminated maple body. Maple neck. 24 \u00be inch scale. Hardly played. No fret wear. No buckle rash. Very minor player wear. Includes gig bag.
