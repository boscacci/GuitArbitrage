Guitar is in absolutely fantastic shape for it's age, no major blemishes at all. Only a small amount of corrosion on two of the bridge saddle springs and a very very small crack on the face of the bridge pickup at the end of the rail that you can barely see. Guitar is nearly perfect outside of that, it has been a well-loved instrument. Neck pocket is perfect, no play. Never gigged. You won't be disappointed with this guitar! These guitars are renowned for their great action and playability. The satin neck finish and large radius make this thing a dream to play as far as Strat-style guitars go. Build quality of a G&L is night and day compared to a Fender, this thing has been a rock for me nearly 19 years. Never one problem. Take it away before I come to my senses.", "ItemID": "142355915248", "EndTime": "2019-01-26T19:42:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2017-04-20T16:19:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-G-L-USA-LEGACY-SPECIAL-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-SWAMP-ASH-BLADE-PUs-DFS-VIBRATO-CASE-/142355915248", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Georgetown, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1423559152488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDU0MA==/z/MNIAAOSwXYtYwNG9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDU0MA==/z/~ocAAOSwTM5YwNHJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDU0MA==/z/g5MAAOSwOgdYwNHQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDU0MA==/z/ABgAAOSwTM5YwNHV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDU0MA==/z/vn8AAOSwax5YwNHX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/NsEAAOSwXYtYwNHc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/rfYAAOSw2gxYwNHf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01833", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "swipe079", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 53, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 212}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 G&L USA LEGACY SPECIAL ELECTRIC GUITAR SWAMP ASH BLADE PUs DFS VIBRATO CASE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Items Included", "Value": ["Case"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Legacy"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["NATURAL SWAMP ASH SOLID BODY"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 10017, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
