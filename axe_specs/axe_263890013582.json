{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Nuno Bettencourt / Extreme / Mourning Widows / Dramagods NOTE - Case in pics is no longer included. This is a players guitar! Great neck with low action. Has Buzz Feiten Tuning System, Grover 18:1 tuners, original Washburn and Bill Lawrence pickups. Guitar appears a tad darker in pics than in person. All electronics work as they should, and includes the original whammy bar. (sorry no pic, but mint condition) Guitar has had very little use and has been stored inside a case most of its life. The one and only flaw is a very small impact mark that is very hard to see and obviously doesn't affect play-ability at all. (see last pic) Stays in tune and has a great warm tone. (I reserve the right to decide carrier UPS vs USPS) NOTE - By purchasing this guitar, you understand that if for some reason you want to return this guitar, buyer is responsible for return shipping costs, plus full insurance. NO EXCEPTIONS!! (If you can't agree to this, than please don't buy) I've sold many guitars over the years with 100% satisfaction, and this is a great guitar! You won't be disappointed in how this plays!!! Serial #09030130 I specialize in rare, vintage, unique, retro and unusual items, so please visit my store for more FUN! Thanks for looking, and have fun Treasure Hunting!", "ItemID": "263890013582", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T19:30:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-08-20T17:41:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-N2-Electric-Guitar-NUNO-BETTENCOURT-Buzz-Feiten-Bill-Lawrence-Grover-EX-/263890013582", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Beaverton, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2638900135828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WsgAAOSw8W1bevXw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6asAAOSwiv5bevYS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eBQAAOSw2q1bevdR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9zoAAOSwGCNbevZ2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j2sAAOSw7FJbevcL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ADYAAOSwR0pbevZb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dLkAAOSwVAZbevbY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iJsAAOSwjKJbevav/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "97006", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "general331", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2713, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 4}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn N2 Electric Guitar NUNO BETTENCOURT Buzz Feiten/Bill Lawrence/Grover EX", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["N2"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Strat"]}]}, "HitCount": 799, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=2314047", "StoreName": "McFlys Antiques and Collectibles"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM"], "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
