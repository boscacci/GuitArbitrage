{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I believe this is a 1985 or 86 Fernandes limited edition. When I bought it 3 years ago it was in rough shape cracks in headstock a crack in the body. I glued it all back and refinished it. Now it plays and sounds amazing. The neck is really cool with a vintage amber stain and tru oil finish which feels really nice. There are some blemishes. The headstock has some crack lines where it was repaired and some filled in spots where it had been dinged. There is a line that show through the paint, but overall I think this is a really cool guitar. I would keep it but I have to many. These guitars in excellent condition can bring 1000 dollars or more. All parts are original except the pick guard tone pots and saddles of course paint which is the original color", "ItemID": "113597811663", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T20:29:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-25T20:29:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fernandes-Vintage-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar-/113597811663", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Spotsylvania, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135978116638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EToAAOSwfTlcS2rr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nCUAAOSwFFVcS2rm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BbwAAOSwHptcS2rp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FHYAAOSwmo1cS2ro/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ACEAAOSwzEVcS2rt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4MAAAOSwFs1cS2rl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "22553", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "skdbk", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 441, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 856}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fernandes  Vintage Stratocaster Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fernandes"]}]}, "HitCount": 287, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
