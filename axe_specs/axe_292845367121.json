{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great used condition! **PLEASE READ BEFORE BIDDING** I purchased this used as a 1996 USA Custom Shop with no COA. The serial number does not authenticate online. I asked my local luthier that I\u2019ve dealt with for years about it and to look it over. He and I both agree this is an authentic Fender guitar. From what I\u2019ve been told and read, Custom Shop guitars are difficult to verify without a proper COA and going through other certificate processes that I neither have the time or desire to do. With this in mind, bid accordingly. I do NOT 100% guarantee authenticity. Regardless, this is a killer guitar with HOT Roswell pickups in the neck and bridge. There are no dings in the guitar, but some of the binding has become discolored. There is no pickguard installed. This guitar is NOT a true bright white. It is an aged white/light cream color.
