{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Jackson js32 rhoads guitar. In very good used condition. Guitar has normal use knicks and scratches, the only two bigger ones are pointed out on pictures. The sleek, offset-V Rhoads is the legendary heart from which the Jackson Bloodline is pumped. The JS32 Rhoads with FLoyd Rose Electric Guitar features an alder body, rock maple neck, and a 24-fret compound-radius rosewood fingerboard, two high-output Jackson CVR2 humbucking pickups, and a Floyd Rose-Licensed JT580 double-locking 2-point tremolo. Compound Radius Fingerboard A feature unique to Jackson that lets you shred like no other. It is rounder near the nut \u201c perfect for fingering crushing chords and deadly riffs. Then, as you climb the neck, the fingerboard flattens out, making it perfect for effortless warp-speed shredding and the widest string bends known to man. 24 Jumbo Frets The 24 jumbo frets are superbly finished and easily accessible on all models. When combined with Jackson's compound radius fingerboard, this feature ensures effortless string bending and super-fast shredding all the way up to the 24th fret. Distinctive Shark Fin Inlays Undeniable, unmistakable, and 100% Jackson. This instantly recognizable feature makes our guitars stand out from the crowd. Jackson guitars not only play better \u201c they look better, too. High-Output, Custom-Voiced Covered Jackson Pickups Painstakingly voiced for full, rich tone while providing maximum overdrive and sustain. These bad boys also clean up nicely when rolled back, which isn't always true of high-output pickups.
