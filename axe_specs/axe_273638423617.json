{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this pretty rare dark blue made in China Squier By Fender Showmaster Stratocaster Guitar with a factory Floyd Rose Tremolo Bridge. This guitar has the HSS pick up configuration which offers a wide range of tonal versatility. This is a 22 Fret shred machine. There is very little info on the web about these guitars. From what I can tell these were made in the late 90\u2019s time frame. The Tremolo bridge on these guitars look to be a Unbranded Gotoh bridge and are very high quality with hardened steel plate and saddles like the original German made Floyd Rose Bridges from the 80\u2019s & 90\u2019s, not like the Floyd Rose Special crap being offered today on most Floyd Rose Tremolo Guitars. There is no case or Tremolo arm. This Guitar is used and does show signs of use but is still a solid guitar. The body and finish do have some chips, dings, and scratches (see pics). However these are only cosmetic and do not affect the function of this guitar. Some would say it has character or Mojo. Matter of opinion I guess. This guitar will need a set of strings and a set up to your liking. This guitar will come with a used gig bag. No hard sell case just a used gig bag. This guitar is in excellent shape for being almost 20 years old. Please review all pics as they are part of the description. Please ask any and all questions before purchasing as I do not accept returns. I only ship to the lower 48 states of the USA. That means that I do not ship to Alaska or Hawaii. I do not ship internationally so please don\u2019t ask. I do not ship to PO boxes or APO addresses. I only accept PayPal payment. This item will be packaged safe and secure and insured so that it arrives to you in the exact condition it leaves here. Please review my feedback and buy with confidence. This guitar is in fully functioning condition as are all the items I sell.", "ItemID": "273638423617", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T18:56:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T19:55:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squire-Fender-Showmaster-Floyd-Rose-Stratocaster-Guitar-Dark-Blue-Gig-Bag-/273638423617", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fredericksburg, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736384236178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eZEAAOSwWrxcLmSY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8z8AAOSwHSdcLmSc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xmgAAOSwCjpcLmSv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fdAAAOSwjMtcLmSf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WEkAAOSwfvtcLmSi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Df4AAOSwnh5cLmSm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mVoAAOSw55FcLmSk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OYIAAOSwnKFcLmSp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lXwAAOSw8a9cLmSn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VI4AAOSwHDdcLmSt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/riQAAOSwLSZcLmSa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fksAAOSwzgtcLmSr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "22405", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rodney6024", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1035, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.2, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.2, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 237}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squire Fender Showmaster Floyd Rose Stratocaster Guitar Dark Blue & Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Showmaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 518, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=299144936", "StoreName": "Happenstance Store"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
