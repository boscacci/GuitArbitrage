{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1993 Fender American Standard Telecaster. Midnight Blue with pearloid pickguard. Guitar was upgraded with Texas Special pickups and a 4-way selector switch. Has a great sound and plays really well. There are some dings in the finish that I've tried to capture in the photos. They are cosmetic only, and don't go through to the wood.\u00a0 I've had the guitar for about 10 years. I just don't really play it. I'm more of a bass player and find that the Tele is just sitting there looking pretty. Would rather it gets used. I'm including the original Fender Hardshell Case that I got with it when I bought it used. The case is not in great condition on the outside, the plastic is dented and the clasps don't line up well. It closes and locks fine though.", "ItemID": "223237144309", "EndTime": "2018-11-25T20:02:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-18T20:02:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1993-Fender-American-Standard-USA-Telecaster-Hard-Shell-Case-/223237144309", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Brooklyn, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232371443098080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jgUAAOSwHnJb1hRi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9MwAAOSwAE9b1hRm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PtYAAOSwELBb1hRn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wFUAAOSw831b1hRk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wNcAAOSw~2hb1hRp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kE4AAOSwxgNb1hRh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11226", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "monkistan", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 87, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 730.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 730.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1415}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1993 Fender American Standard (USA) Telecaster with Hard Shell Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1993"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 440, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 740.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
