{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Washburn SB-8 with hard case. The SB-8 is one of Washburn\u2019s Wing Series. The Wing Series included the SB-8, T- bird, Raven, Falcon, Hawk and Eagle.The SB-8 has the standard no nonsense fixed bridge with brass saddles. It has two volume knobs, one for each pickup and a tone knob. The neck pickup splits into a single coil with the push/ pull volume knob for that pickup.The SB-8 has a bolt on neck like a Stratocaster. The advantage of a bolt on neck over set or through necks is that there\u2019s more neck adjustment possible for fine tuning of the setup if that is needed at any time. So there\u2019s that, and if you ever need to replace parts, a bolt on neck can easily be replaced.The guitar is in very good condition. There are some scratches and several small indentations or chips in the finish. See photos for the best description.It plays and sounds great with low action and the frets show slight wear. There are no dead spots anywhere up the neck.All electronics work as they should and it sounds great plugged in. The serial number is not altered. I photo shopped the last two digits to prevent scammers from using the number for their purposes.The stand in the photos is not included. The later model non original Washburn hard case shown in the photo is included.Ships to the continental USA. Please ask about shipping outside of the continental USA.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. The guitar will be well packed and insured for the selling price.", "ItemID": "302656214690", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T12:32:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-03-02T04:51:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-SB-8-Wing-Series-Hard-Shell-Case-/302656214690", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Harvard, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3026562146908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/y-YAAOSwK7pamNTo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/0H4AAOSw68lamNVf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/UKAAAOSwQglamNWm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/vHAAAOSweRhamNWv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/634AAOSw~fJamNXI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ywwAAOSwLWZamNXg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7K8AAOSw~fJamNYN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/CWIAAOSweD9amNZH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7-UAAOSwGstamNZs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/uL8AAOSwYRhamNa~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/eOIAAOSw9uBamNdN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/xXkAAOSweRhamNeS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01451", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "miller10547", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 288, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn SB-8 Wing Series with Hard Shell Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}]}, "HitCount": 2466, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
