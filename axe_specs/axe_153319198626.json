{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Very clean, players es330 made in 1968. Long neck version. Serial # 970983. This guitar is all original, except for the pickups which are aftermarket alnico by Artec. The guitar is professionally routed for Humbucker\u2019s. (I have pics of the routes if requested i will send them) The current pickups are true single coil and have the look, sound, and fit of the originals. Pickups are RWRP for hum cancelling in the middle switch position. The original case and Pickguard are not included. Excellent newer hardshell case included. All the other parts are original including the tuners which are in great shape, (had replacement tuners at one point) original Nut, wiring harness, pots, knobs, switch, output jack, trapeze tailpiece, Pat# Bridge, Ect. Guitar plays great and has plenty of fret life left, there is fret wear under each string, but plays great. The original finish has nice laquer checking. There is a filled hole where a mini switch was once mounted. Two small pieces of binding around the fingerboard area were replaced. And the binding has some shrinking around the body, although the binding shrinkage has not progressed at all in the last 20 years that I have owned the guitar. The guitar is part of a very large private collection of over 60 guitars, and has seen very little use in the last couple of decades.", "ItemID": "153319198626", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T17:59:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-27T17:59:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-1968-GIBSON-ES-330-SUNBURST-GUITAR-Long-Neck-Version-No-Reserve-Auction-/153319198626", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "White Plains, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533191986268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eWIAAOSw91JcDBew/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tjUAAOSwx9lcDBez/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6zQAAOSw5cZcDBe2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rbsAAOSws99cDBe4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3GUAAOSwZBRcDBe6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Q-wAAOSwMflcDBe8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/muMAAOSw~rhcDBe-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NgEAAOSwUm5cDBfA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VMsAAOSwRrlcDBfC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dNsAAOSwENVcDBfE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2jgAAOSwVCpcDBlh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/us0AAOSwnv9cDBlk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "10607", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "retroaxe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5319, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1970.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1970.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 454}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "VINTAGE 1968 GIBSON ES-330 SUNBURST GUITAR Long Neck Version No Reserve Auction", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-330"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 495, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1995.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
