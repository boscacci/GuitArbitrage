{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "It's time once again for my annual holiday guitar sale. Lot's of people look forward to this each year, so here we go. You are looking at an American made 2005 Les Paul Studio electric guitar, that comes with a Gator Cases hard shell case. It has a tobacco sunburst paint job, gold hardware, and mother of pearl trapezoid inlays in the fret board. The guitar is in good condition, and just shows some minor play wear and some finish dulling. Just cosmetics, but want the buyer to be aware it's not brand new looking. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a cool guitar, that is sure to keep going up in value. Each year I sell off the high end guitars that we have acquired at our pawn shop during the year, and they have been sold to almost every country in the world. We only sell quality products, and our feedback will back that up. All will be sold on a no reserve basis, and no auctions will be closed early or with a buy it now, so bid to buy. Thanks for looking, and please check out my other auctions too.", "ItemID": "183591829403", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T00:24:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T00:24:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Electric-Guitar-2005-hard-shell-case-sunburst-USA-1-/183591829403", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Riverside, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835918294038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QQwAAOSwE~ZcGDzH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NsoAAOSwkjJcGDyX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ElcAAOSwFGNcGDya/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kGMAAOSwsQJcGDyL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vuEAAOSwAbxcGDyQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lckAAOSw9lBcGDye/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lwkAAOSwu4dcGDyd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eDcAAOSwF5hcGDyp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UaQAAOSwkHFcGDyw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FKEAAOSwZ8pcGDyr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lMsAAOSwnWpcGDyn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iSYAAOSwOcpcGDyy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92506", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "inlandjandl", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 691, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 51, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 619.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 619.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "z***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 22}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Studio Electric Guitar 2005 with hard shell case,sunburst USA $1", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Tobacco Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple", "Ash", "Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["LPSANSCH1"]}]}, "HitCount": 1691, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 629.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78627826", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
