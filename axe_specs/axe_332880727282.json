{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1979 Gibson explorer E2 all original. This was refretted by gibson 2 years ago. It is very playable and in great shape. (Gibson just done the fretwork)|\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\|||||| There was a slight back bow in the neck when i got it. I loosened the truss rod and pressed it back in place over the course of about a week. It will probably need to be tweaked on for a year or so in my opinion. (holding by the nut and body and forcing a back bow by hand)I just finishing a quick setup on it.Neck relief with just a slight amount of tension on the truss rod. Holding down on the 1st and 20th fret .10 on a inch measured 7 -8th fret. (standard gibson setup)String height .90 on bass side and .60 on tremble measured on the 12th fret. (standard gibson setup) All the electronics and hardware appear to be original except the bridge but the original comes with it. I took as good of pics as i could get There is some buckle rash on the back The pics don't show it well enough There is a bit more than it looks like but nothing is terribly deep just all over the place on the back.Knicks and dings everywhere as you would expect from a 40 year old guitar. A strap button was drilled in the heel as i took a picture of that as well. The tuners hold tune well but you can feel there age when turning them they are old. Comes with the original hardshell case that is beat and tattered but still works well. There are no examples of the E2 made this early that is completely original i could find.Many people are asking much more for guitars in a lot worse shape without original parts. Weight is just shy of 10 lbs (bathroom scale not the best to use)Ship to the lower 48 only If you have any questions please ask.", "ItemID": "332880727282", "EndTime": "2018-11-23T19:06:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-13T19:06:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1979-Gibson-Explorer-E2-Electric-Guitar-vintage-flying-v-moderne-futura-/332880727282", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Akron, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328807272828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nvsAAOSwZhtbw4De/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/p90AAOSw4M5bw4Dg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rhQAAOSwm1dbw4Dn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/O2gAAOSwty5bw4Dr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/smYAAOSwFvBbw4Du/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dqEAAOSwR~tbw4Dx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8jYAAOSw0NRbw4D3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x5sAAOSwXTJbw4EB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-4gAAOSwVEBbw4YW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/M3EAAOSwviFbw4YZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gisAAOSwIDJbw4Ym/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GP8AAOSwG9Fbw4Y7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44314", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dbc1chesschess", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2116, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***7", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 538}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1979 Gibson Explorer E2 Electric Guitar vintage flying v moderne futura", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1979"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["DSXREBCH1", "DSXREBCH"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["DSXREBCH"]}]}, "HitCount": 1028, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78618135", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
