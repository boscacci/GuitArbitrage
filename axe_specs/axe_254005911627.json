{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I purchased this guitar about 15 years ago. I thought I was going to get serious about learning to play. More money than sense I purchased this and a Martin acoustic. Both are gathering dust. This Montreal is in excellent condition and comes with the original Godin gig bag. Godin is a Canadian company. This guitar was made in Canada and assembled in the U.S. We will have to discuss shipping. It could be more or less than the 100.00 that is on the listing. Thanks for looking! OVERVIEWVoiced for jazz and blues with electro-acoustic flexibility.The Montreal is the latest in a series of dual-voiced electric guitars from Godin that marry the sounds of traditional magnetic pickups with the saddle transducers in the bridge. The 2-chamber body is carved from a solid block of mahogany and capped with a carved solid mahogany top adorned with f-holes and cream binding. The 22-fret mahogany neck is shaped for exceptional comfort by Godin's ergocut technique, which leaves the back of the neck a comfortable modern C shape, while the front, fretboard edge, and frets are angled slightly in. The recessed pickups and bridge plus sculpted bolt-on neck joint make the Montreal Electric Guitar very comfortable. The 2 Godin humbuckers produce an extensive range of sounds thanks to a special 5-way switch that provides 5 distinct tones. Add in the L.R. Baggs transducers loaded in the bridge saddles and the palette of sounds becomes infinite. 2 separate outputs are set up so that the electric and acoustic voices can be blended in the guitar using a single patch cord or at the amp/mixer using both outputs. The Montreal guitar hardware is black and gold.", "ItemID": "254005911627", "EndTime": "2018-12-07T17:02:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-30T17:02:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Godin-Montreal-Electric-Guitar-Semi-hollow-Body-Excellent-Condition-/254005911627", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Melbourne, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540059116278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/3z0AAOSwQXlcAWjp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/7KwAAOSwFAtcAWjr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTUyWDcxMA==/z/ww4AAOSwUPVcAWxD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkxWDE2MDA=/z/~loAAOSwC8ZcAWPX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/Q60AAOSwtvZcAWjr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/JIYAAOSw4m9cAWjq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/o38AAOSw~slcAWjq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/zPsAAOSw8MxcAWjp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/lV4AAOSwnh9cAWjp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDYzMg==/z/b3IAAOSwwPdcAWjq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY3WDEwMDA=/z/cxkAAOSwHAxcAWjr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oLQAAOSwuNNcAWjs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32935", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jsarkb", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 689}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Godin Montreal Electric Guitar Semi-hollow Body in Excellent Condition.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Godin"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 300, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 720.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
