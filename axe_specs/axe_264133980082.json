{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a guitar in excellent condition with no dings, chips, or other damage. It has the usual few scuffs which I can't even get on a photo. There are no buckle marks on the back of the guitar as when I play all my guitars I wear my sweats. Some pick scratches on the pickguard. Basically no fret wear on the fingerboard as it has little playing time on it. I am not a musician and the guitar has never been gigged or left my house. I am just a home hobby player and I mostly play my acoustic guitar as I like to sing old country music. The guitar plays great, sounds great, and there is no buzzing of the strings anywhere on the neck. The premium ash body has some of the best wood grain I have ever seen and it looks great with the aged cherry burst finish. As per photo # 11 you can see that the premium ash upgrade costed $150.00. I also upgraded the case to a G & G case made in the U.S.A. by The Original Vintage Case Company instead of the usual molded case the guitar comes with. The case is in like new condition also as it never went anywhere. The guitar weighs 8 pounds 3.8 ounces on an official postal scale. All the basic specs on the guitar can be seen on photos 11 and 12. It will be shipped UPS as they do a great job for me which is why I am charging $100.00 for shipping which doesn't even cover it especially with the weight of the case. Most ebay hints say to ship all guitars in a gig bag to conserve on the weight but I don't believe in doing that.", "ItemID": "264133980082", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T20:49:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T20:49:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-American-Deluxe-Guitar-2002-/264133980082", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "East Troy, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641339800828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/WaUAAOSwEGBcOlAB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/xJQAAOSwBVdcOlAH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/MEYAAOSw6X1cOlAN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/U3sAAOSwA3xcOlAS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/u34AAOSw8iZcOlAW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/DiIAAOSwjmRcOlAb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/2RMAAOSwCXxcOlAe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/z-AAAOSw9xJcOlAl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/A~0AAOSwa~FcOlAq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/qn4AAOSw~EBcOlAx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/tRUAAOSwxx1cOlA8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/r1kAAOSwNqxcOlBD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53120", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "larryandme97", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 279, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 936.62, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 936.62, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 280}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster American Deluxe Guitar 2002", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster American Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Aged Cherry Burst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Premium Ash"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 383, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 946.62, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent Condition, Aged Cherry Burst with Premium Ash Body.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
