{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I used this moderately for light practice, typically to bring on vacation once/year and as a spare for rehearsals (it was rarely gigged with). It is in very good condition: the only marks are on the very top of the head as shown. At one point the toggle wasn't working properly. I opened the control cavity and made sure none of the wires were grounding out, and haven't had a problem since. This features bird inlays on the fretboard and comes with a PRS gig bag. This item is used but in fine working condition. I pack well, I ship quickly, and I am honest. I have gone out of my way to guarantee customer satisfaction. I am a working musician and I have come to rely on eBay in order to get fair prices for my used gear. I would not jeopardize that by playing games. Item is sold \"as is\" and no warranty or return services are promised or implied. However, if you believe that I have not accurately described this item please contact me and we'll try to work something out.", "ItemID": "113347100960", "EndTime": "2018-11-13T02:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-03T02:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-PRS-SE-Custom-Semi-Hollow-w-Birds-/113347100960", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Berlin, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1133471009608080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xNIAAOSwxxVb3Iko/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDc3/z/iGYAAOSwxx9b3Ikq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TAwAAOSw-tlb3Ikt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/35oAAOSwMBdb3Ikx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MFgxNjAw/z/bHcAAOSwDDRb3Ikz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTA1/z/Ml4AAOSwza9b3Ik3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aH4AAOSw2ptb3Ik6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjgz/z/rB8AAOSwi7Vb3IlL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06037", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sofa-king-great", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 103, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 93}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith PRS SE Custom Semi-Hollow w/ Birds", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 199, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 330.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
