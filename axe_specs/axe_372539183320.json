{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "ESP LTD Elite Eclipse-I EMG Black Flame Maple Top 6-String Electric Guitar Item Description:You are bidding on a previously owned and in good playing condition ESP LTD Elite Eclipse-I EMG 6-string electric guitar. This auction is for the guitar, hard case, and keys you see pictured. Nothing else is included. It comes as pictured. Please take a moment to look at the pictures and get a better idea of what you are bidding on. This guitar has scratches from normal playwear. The majority of the back of the neck is no longer glossy where it looks like the gloss has worn away (see pictures 6,7, and 9 for a better look). None of the scratches are deep, and the neck still feels smooth to the touch. It almost looks like someone gave it a light sanding or it was rubbed intentionally that way. The electronics have all been tested and are in good working condition. The neck is straight. The frets have normal wear and have plenty of life in them. The guitar is in excellent playing condition. It has a flame maple top with a translucent black finish. The case has scuffs and scratches from being moved around. Please take a moment to check out my other great items!
