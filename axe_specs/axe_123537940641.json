{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "INCLUDES ADDITIONAL PICK UP, AND ORIGINAL WARRANTY INFO! COMES IN THE ORIGINAL CASE. Here are some reviews for this beautiful instrument: Sound Quality I've been playing for 42 years--I'm a working pro who plays rock, blues, country, jazz, R&B, and anything else they'll pay me to play! I'm currently running through a Fender Stage 160, and on gigs where I need effects I use a Digitech GNX-2 between the guitar and the amp. I bought the guitar specifically for blues and jazz, but it sounds really good on the other stuff too. I'm not a big fan of mini-humbuckers, but these sound killer--rich, full and bright simultaneously. No, it's not spanky like a Strat or twangy like a Tele, but I have other guitars for that. Imagine a Firebird crossed with a 335 and you'll get the idea... Reliability/Durability The finish is gorgeous--beautifully applied and buffed. As I mentioned, there's pearloid binding on practically every possible surface, and there's no blue in the binding anywhere. Excellent scraping job. Did I mention that the only plastic parts are the knobs, and that the pickguard is curly maple, stained blue to match the body and pearloid-bound?General CommentsA few years ago I saw Robert Lockwood Jr. on Austin City Limits playing a 12-string Blues T-Bone(!) and thought it was one of the coolest-looking guitars I'd ever seen. When 20th Century Guitar ran a review a while ago, I contacted the distributor (see above) and promised myself that if the guitar turned out to be as cool as it looked, I'd get one if I could afford it. 2000 O.N.G. Deviser Blues T Bone Made in Tokyo Japan. One of the most meticulously hand-made and unique archtops ever to come out of Japan. It's just like the one Robert Lockhart Jr plays. It has the cool factor going on for sure, but is also an archtop made to play blues music. The craftsmanship of this guitar exceeds almost anything else. It's a work of art as well as a tone monster. The guitar is in near mint condition, comes with the factory Gig bag. Buyer is responsible for all shipping.
