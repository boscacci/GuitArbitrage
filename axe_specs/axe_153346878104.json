{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Epiphone SG G-400 in excellent condition. I bought this guitar about 12 years ago or so, brand new from the store. At the time of purchase, it had a small \"dink\" in the front, just to the left of the tailpiece (in the last picture, the highlighter pen is pointing to it), which I filled in with black nail polish and is hardly noticeable; from 5 feet away you can't even see it. Other than that, there are no scratches, dings, or \"belt buckle rash\". The case you see in the pictures is NOT included; guitar will be shipped in its box. I changed out the original \"Kluson\" style tuners for some Epiphone \"Grover\" style you see on the head. If you look closely you can see the screw holes left from the changeover. I also replaced the plain black pickguard with a nicer perloid one. And yes, the volume and tone knobs are different as well. Just some small cosmetic changes to the guitar, nothing else. This guitar has seen very little play time; I would estimate less than 50 hours of play. In fact, the last couple years it has been sealed up in a case and not even touched. I bought the guitar on a whim, mostly because the store offered me a great price due to the \"dink\" previously mentioned. I have four other SG guitars on my racks plus a host of others, and now we are looking at moving across the country this Summer, so it's time to maybe weed out a few of the lesser played ones. This guitar is in fantastic condition and plays exactly as it did on day one; no fret wear at all. Shipping will be via UPS Ground service and is a flat fee of $30.00. Ask any questions if you have them.", "ItemID": "153346878104", "EndTime": "2019-01-27T20:47:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T20:47:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-SG-G-400-Electric-Guitar-Black-setneck-upgrades-exc-condition-/153346878104", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tualatin, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533468781048080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3Mlg2Njc=/z/92oAAOSw0vJcRNee/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tY0AAOSwFSNcRNee/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SJUAAOSwk-1cRNee/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p1oAAOSw8zNcRNee/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JWgAAOSwlLlcRNeg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lHUAAOSwIABcRNeg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RswAAOSwlfNcRNeg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "97062", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "trifox", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 500, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 22, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 95}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone SG G-400 Electric Guitar, Black, setneck, upgrades, exc. condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["G-400"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 587, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 205.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78587404", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
