{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1982 Fullerton AVRI \u201862 Reissue Stratocaster in beautiful three-color Sunburst. Serial Number V008495; an early (December 1982) and exceptionally clean example in spectacular condition, a 9.5 and appears to have very minimal play wear. As always, I try to deal in only the best items possible, and this instrument is no exception. Neck date is 12-15-82. The neck is a thin C-Shape profile and is fast! Neck thickness (or thinness) is 20.15 millimeters at the 1st fret, and 21.81 millimeters at the 12th fret. Frets have very little to no wear. Rosewood board is excellent, dark and beautiful. The neck is set up straight with a solid bridge, low action and the guitar stays in tune perfectly, providing lots of sustain and Fender's famous \"Bell Tone.\" Minty headstock and tuning keys. All solder joints look original except for the factory provided 5-way switch, which works very well, and is quiet. Potentiometers are coded R1378226 (CTS, 26th week of 1982). Original tweed \"Duck Foot\" case in excellent condition with original manual, vibrato bar and extra tremolo springs with Fender envelope. All case latches are in good working order. Perhaps best of all, this guitar is a very resonant build weighing only 7.4 pounds with the vibrato arm. All in all, it's a very collectable guitar built to factory 1962 Fender specs. Very difficult to find in such nice condition. These are only going up in value. Some additional \"collector\" features include exceptionally rare factory pin routing at the bass side of the tremolo cavity (as shown in the rear cavity photo). This factory routing is far more rare than the more common, but also rare, pin routing Fender's Reissue Team at times applied to the front control cavity. But perhaps even more rare is the amazing EXTRA-DEEP control cavity routing (which I have only seen on two of these early Fullerton reissues); look closely and you can identify a tremolo cover screw protruding through the cavity route! Amazing and rare. Of course, the \"worm hole\" route is also extra deep on this model. The black-bottom pickups sound beautiful and the guitar is well-balanced. I am only selling this instrument to pay off Federal (and State) tax bills. No reserve auction. Please trust my feedback and bid with confidence. Shipping to Continental U.S. and Canada only. Shipping to USA will be $99.95. Guitar and case included as described. Other items shown in background photos are not included in this auction.
