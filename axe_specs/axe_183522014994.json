{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Mint condition 2016 Charvel San Dimas Pro Mod. Only played a few times in my home, so of course, no fretwear, scratches, or imperfections. The photos don't show it well, but the transparent purple color quilt maple top is stunning against the dark chrome hardware. Selling because I mainly play my acoustics, now. The neck is dead straight and the action is low. It was set up perfectly from the factory and I didn't need to adjust at all. It's still on it's first set of strings. Includes tremolo arm. From the Charvel web page at http://www.charvel.com/guitars/pro-mod/pro-mod-san-dimas-style-1-hh-fr-maple-fingerboard-transparent-purple-burst/ The Pro-Mod series continues upon Charvel\u2019s storied legacy of innovative excellence in high-performance guitar design, offering the latest technology and top-notch features that modern players need.An ideal instrument for dazzling high-speed playing, the San Dimas\u00ae Style 1 HH FR M QM boasts scorching sound, stunning style and grin-inducing playing feel and performance. Featuring an alder body with an elegant quilt maple top, this guitar also has a bolt-on two-piece maple neck with a pair of graphite reinforcement rods to resist bending and warping under environmental stresses. The speed neck profile is designed for lightning fast playing and completely unhindered position shifts while the comfortably rolled fingerboard edges provide the broken-in feel of an instrument with plenty of playing miles on it, and plenty more to go. Its maple fingerboard hosts 22 jumbo frets and black dot inlays, and has a heel-mounted spoke wheel for quick and convenient truss rod adjustments.High-output Seymour Duncan\u00ae JB and Seymour Duncan '59 humbucking pickups are directly mounted to the body, cranking out high-octane rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tone with plenty of sweet overtones. The volume control conceals a push/pull coil split to have even more tonal variations on tap while the No-Load tone control operates like a standard tone control from positions one through nine, removing itself from the circuit at position ten for transparent sound, letting the full natural voice of the guitar shine through. Dive to rumbling depths or add a well-placed rising harmonic without sacrificing your tuning with the Floyd Rose\u00ae 1000 series double-locking recessed tremolo bridge system.Designed with style in mind, the San Dimas Style 1 HH FR M QM is available in a variety of striking and elegant finishes, complete with a Charvel neck plate, sealed die-cast tuners and standard strap buttons.", "ItemID": "183522014994", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T02:30:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-07T02:30:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Charvel-Pro-Mod-San-Dimas-Style-1-2H-FR-Trans-Purple-2966002592-/183522014994", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Andover, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835220149948080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/w2AAAOSwlypbzgFa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/P~AAAOSwAfVbzgFZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VdMAAOSwMxJbzgFa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5dwAAOSw~2hbzgFa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RzsAAOSwrGlbzgFa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01810", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "techbypw", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 413, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 440.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 440.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***4", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4907}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Charvel Pro Mod San Dimas Style 1, 2H, FR, Trans Purple (2966002592)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Pro-Mod San Dimas Style 1"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Purple"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder with Quilt Maple Top"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Pro Mod Models"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["2966002593"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 288, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 445.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
