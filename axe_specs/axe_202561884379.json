{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Jackson RR3 Pro Series Rhoads - Ivory with Black Pinstripes and Carrying Case Product Description 223886fj-x300-GT-A9 Jackson RR3 Pro Series Rhoads - Ivory with Black Pinstripes and Carrying Case The Jackson Pro RR3 is the latest evolution of a classic solidbody electric guitar, striking the perfect balance between a tried-and-true design and modern features. The RR3's familiar offset \"V\" shape will fill you with nostalgia, while Seymour Duncan SH-6 Distortion humbuckers ensure that you'll experience an incredibly flexible high-output tone that renders pristine cleans and snarling distortion with equal precision. The RR3 features a comfortable oil-finished maple neck and a lightning-fast compound-radius fingerboard that are tailor-made for technical fretwork. Topped off with attractive gold hardware and a Floyd Rose double-locking tremolo, the Jackson Pro RR3 is an outstanding solidbody electric guitar. Please see photos for exact condition.
