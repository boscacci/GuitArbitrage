One of the potentiometer shafts had broken so I had the pot replaced. Has been professionally adjusted and setup and plays wonderfully. I don't have the original case, but it comes with a strap with Schaller locks. A beautiful and rare instrument, considered to be the \"Holy Grail\" of American made Kramers. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Condition:Pre-owned; in great condition with light to moderate wear. The body is in good condition with few minor dings, light scratches and normal wear to the finish. The fretboard and frets are in very good condition with light wear. There is minor wear to the headstock with a few light scratches on the back of the headstock. The neck is in good shape with light wear and a minor ding on the back of the neck. There is moderate oxidation and wear to the hardware and tuner knobs. Please see photos for actual condition. Overall, in great condition with average wear.
