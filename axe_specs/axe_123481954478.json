{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Factory scalloped shred machine from my Yngwie wanna be days. I had 3 of these (scalloped) I held out with this one but I don't play anymore. When I took the pictures I ripped it up for a sec and it was sucking me in but it still has to go. I don't remember which rail pick up is in the bridge but I always \"volume match\" pickups so it doesn't sound weird while switching. What can I say? yes it has scratches and etc... Just look at it as an old strat. The hardware looks aged because it is and the neck has seasoned for decades so if it was gonna warp, it would have done it long ago. Its a keeper if I was gonna keep going but thanks for looking at my old strat. This is a real Strat that you don't have to be careful on stage with. That is what they mean by \"players guitar\". Sweat on it and twist that note with that holy grail sound of a real strat from the 80s. Make no mistake, this guitar has turned some heads.", "ItemID": "123481954478", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T05:20:44.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-10T18:03:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-Floyd-Rose-Scalloped-Neck-Stratocaster-1988-Made-JAPAN-/123481954478", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Port Townsend, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234819544788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5BcAAOSwaalb5xZr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nZ8AAOSw1tJb5xaw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GLgAAOSwI~Vb5xbA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9UsAAOSwRK9b5xbJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ubYAAOSwE~1b5xbe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IUoAAOSwR6Bb5xb0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98368", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "toyn_us", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 191, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "4***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 558}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER Floyd Rose Scalloped Neck Stratocaster - 1988.
