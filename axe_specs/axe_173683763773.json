{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a Metallic Black Jackson Pro Dinky DK2HT Electric Guitar. The guitar is in excellent shape and plays/sounds amazing. For the pickups, it has Seymour Duncan JB in the bridge and '59 in the neck - see additional feature details I swiped from the web below. Cosmetically, this guitar is beautiful with the high-gloss metallic black paint and maple fretboard - doesn't even look played. The only thing of note on the condition is a small imperfection in the paint on the back below the electronics cover which I was able to capture in one of the photos - looks sub-surface, maybe from a small ding. All in all, this guitar looks great with a factory mirror finish. Comes with and ships in a Jackson hardshell electric guitar case, which is also in great shape. Also included are keys to the hardshell case and a new set of strings. The Jackson Pro Dinky DK2HT lists for over $1,000 but normally go for around $850 new. This is a fixed price listing, so $425.00 and it's yours! The guitar will be well-packed and insured. This item ships to Continental US only. Check out my other listings for more good deals. Good luck and thanks for looking!
