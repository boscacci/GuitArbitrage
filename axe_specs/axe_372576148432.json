Surprisingly light to hold, the 1987's signature feature is its burled maple sides which are flavored with little explosions of individual style and character that varies from guitar to guitar. With dark walnut stripes running down the middle, our neck-through construction means the body center is an extension of the neck. Neck-thru designs are known to be significantly harder to mass-produce than bolt-on or set-in neck constructions and are primarily found on high-end guitars. We've figured out a way to not only create a guitar with a legitimate neck-thru design, but did so in a way as to meet a certain price point for anyone who doesn't want to have to dig very deep into their wallets to own one.
