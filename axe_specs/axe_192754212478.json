{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Used 1996 Rickenbacker 360 Mapleglo 6-String Semi-Hollow Body. Serial Number: J94795. Wonderful gem of a guitar plays and sounds great. The guitar does have road wear and buckle wear as seen in the photos. There are some surface cracks in some of the clear coat and plastic band as well. The neck might need to be adjusted, as sometimes needed seasonly. The original hard shell case (included) has road wear and it is missing a metal foot from when I purchased the guitar-- I purchased 10 years ago. This is a great 22 year old guitar!
