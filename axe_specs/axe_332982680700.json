{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Esquire Made in Korea MIK Black Fender Esquire made in Korea in the 90's or early 2000's possibly but I'm not sure, I'm not the original owner. Was made around the same time as the Celtic Esquire and the GT esquires. This one is a little fancier than those because it has a bound neck and body. It has a set neck with fairly low action.It has only one pickup and one volume knob. The frets are still in good shape and have plenty of playing time left in them. There is a scorpion inlay at he 12th fret. The original pickup was replaced by previous owner. It has a P90 copy of unknown manufacture installed now. I don't have the original pickup, sorry. One of the string ferrules in back was also replaced and is not the same size as the others (see pics). It appears that it was not professionally installed. Overall there are light scratches and scuffs on body but nothing major. I\u2019m adding this because someone asked about it: I believe that\u2019s a piece of lint or hair in the second picture. However, there are a pair of parallel lines on the surface of the top and backside of the guitar. I suspect that the wood pieces used to make the body were not properly sanded down all the way before finishing. This is my guess, a guitar tech might be able to diagnose better. I will upload two more pics to show this but it\u2019s very hard to photograph it. I will ship in a cheap gig bag for protection. It's good for shipping and storage but not so good for gigging. I will ship to US only lower 48 states I also lowering the shipping cost to $30 because I have been called out of town because of work and won\u2019t be able to ship until Thursday January 10th Please see pictures for condition. This sale is no returns/as is because I'm using the money to..you guessed it..buy another guitar. So please ask all questions before purchase and I will answer as best as I can.
