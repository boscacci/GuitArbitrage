{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You are bidding on a gently used satin cherry 2007 Gibson es-335 with a locking SKB hard shell case. This is an amazing sounding guitar and very comfortable to play. The guitar is in great condition with a few light scratches on the headstock and some very light scuff marks on the body which cannot be felt. It may be possible to buff out the scuff marks, as they are very light and only on the finish, not the paint. All of these defects are included in the pictures. The case is in good working condition with some scuffs and scratches, appropriate for its age. I bought this guitar and case new in 2007, and it\u2019s been a studio guitar ever since, never played out. My guitar collection has grown over the years and I\u2019ve made the difficult decision to part ways with this beauty.", "ItemID": "123593823219", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T07:26:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T07:26:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Gibson-es-335-dot-cherry-satin-finish-w-Hard-Case-No-Reserve-Free-Shipping-/123593823219", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Middletown, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235938232198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk4/z/onYAAOSwpLVcPDIG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QuUAAOSwpLdcPDIJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o9kAAOSwhfRcPDIE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aD4AAOSwLr1cPDIS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MAMAAOSwjfBcPDIN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r0MAAOSwzhFcPDIU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PvQAAOSwvcFcPDIQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk4/z/OzoAAOSwFs1cPDIL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VUUAAOSwH2VcPDIO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ubQAAOSwxtVcPDIH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "45042", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "grinderofaxes", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 45, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 10, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1558.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1558.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 20}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Gibson es-335 dot cherry satin finish w/Hard Case No Reserve Free Shipping", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 892, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1583.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
