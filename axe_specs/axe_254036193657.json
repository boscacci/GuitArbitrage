{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx,no PO Boxes.I will not ship anywhere else. Most deliveries will require a signature. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone SG Junior with some nice upgrades. Guitar is in very good condition overall,very mild signs of wear.I traded out the old closed back tuners for some more vintage looking Kluson style tuners,you can see some of the holes left from the stock tuners. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. Frets show near zero fret wear and guitar plays real nice. Then I replaced the stock pickup with a Hot Black/White Zebra 4 wire Humbucker pickup, output,about 15k . Sounds great in this guitar.I replaced the stock tone control with a push/pull tone control so you can switch the humbucker into a single coil. Next I upgraded the tone capacitor with a Japanese polyester film foil capacitor. Sometimes I change the caps and I don't hear a big difference,this time the change was quite noticable.Sounded very full on clean tones and has a nice snarl once you add some gain. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. A classy looking guitar that wants to kick some butt. Guitar looks great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea of the condition. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
