{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 2005 Rickenbacker 360/12 in near mint, showroom clean condition and in perfect working order. A custom color example and one of Rickenbacker's \"Color of the Year\" limited runs, this Ric is finished in Montezuma Brown and comes complete with all case candy and the original hardshell case. The tone is everything you expect from a Rickenbacker, with chime, sparkle, and shimmer from the 12 string configuration that instantly conjures memories of '60s British Invasion and folk tunes. The chorusing strings jangle with plenty of top end and balanced, focused lows as well. Even though the pickups are dubbed \"Hi-Gain\" by Rickenbacker, their modest single coil output allows for that signature top end to come through with balanced midrange that has just the right amount of cut. The guitar balances well on a strap and weighs in at 8lbs. Professionally setup and strung with 10-47 strings, this Rickenbacker has low, comfortable action and solid intonation.The dual truss rod enforced maple neck has a medium C shaped profile, with a 1 5/8\" nut width that spaces the strings well for chords and lead lines. The thick slab rosewood fretboard is bound and inlaid with pearl triangle markers. The stock frets retain their full height, with perfectly rounded crowns and zero no wear. This guitar is a true case queen and has barely been played. On the headstock, the original chrome Schaller tuning machines all turn smoothly and hold pitch as they should.All of the electronics work as they should, and the guitar has the option of either mono or stereo operation, with the \"Rick-o-Sound\" dual output jacks. Everything is exactly how it was when the guitar left the Rickenbacker factory, with dual Volume and Tone controls for each pickup, along with an additional fifth knob that blends in the neck pickup signal with that of the bridge. The chrome hardware is flawless, and the plastic parts are clean as can be, including the dual-tiered pickguard which even retains the small foil \"Made in USA\" sticker. Cosmetically, this guitar is showroom clean. While we'll conservatively call it \"near mint,\" we can't find a single scratch on the sleek nitro lacquer Montezuma Brown finish. The original hardshell case and case candy are included. Check out our shop \"Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar,\" and please let us know if we can answer any questions!
