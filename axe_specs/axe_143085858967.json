{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you are searching for a more vintage slightly worn looking Les Paul, then you have found it. It's a 2007 and everyone knows the pre-2015 Les Pauls are the ones to get. Weighs in at about 8.9 pounds. It has normal fret wear for its age, minor dings/scratches, and the covers on the pickups look aged. Although it has a plain maple top, it has a gorgeous grain pattern on the back of the mahogany body. Guitar has Gibson 57 Classics and we actually put on a brand new set of Stewart MacDonald tuners that look like the originals since one had an issue. Plays and sounds great. Comes with the original hard shell case. The MUSIC49 Difference: Music49 is an actual independant guitar shop located in Concord, NC. This is the actual guitar we have in stock, it's not a cover photo from the internet. We have actually played this guitar, and gone over it to check all functionality of the instrument, so it's not sitting on a shelf in a non-climate controlled warehouse.....instead, it's in our shop in the same humidity as the custom guitars we build, and we will go over the guitar again with a \"fine tooth comb\" before we ship it to the customer. If you have any preferences for setup or strings, please contact us before shipping because we have the ability to fine tune any of the aspects of this guitar. If we have not had any specific requests, we do our own inspection to ensure quality, and maintain the Manufacturer's specifications.", "ItemID": "143085858967", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T01:45:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T02:00:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Gibson-Les-Paul-Classic-/143085858967", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430858589678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTg=/z/5HIAAOSwze5bvR9p/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTA=/z/BugAAOSwlxxbvR9o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTY=/z/ztsAAOSwjBVbvR9r/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zDEAAOSwa3ZbvR9m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/29wAAOSwVXRbvR9y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1VAAAOSws29bvR9t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QFcAAOSwUlRbvR9w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28269", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "music_49", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 686, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 181}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Gibson Les Paul Classic", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany/Maple Top"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Classic"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 266, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=127722571", "StoreName": "music 49 Inc"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
