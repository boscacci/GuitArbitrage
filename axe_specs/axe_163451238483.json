{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this vintage intermark electric guitar. I\u2019ve had this guitar for many many years and just pulled it out of storage. The guitar when I got it many years ago was painted that color. Not sure if it\u2019s originallyvsupposed to be that color or if someone painted it but it looks really cool. I plugged the guitar into a amp and it still works. There are 2 missing strings and one of the tuning knobs is missing a part on the back as you can see in the photos. the guitar has some other normal wear from being played over the years. Other than that it\u2019s a really cool vintage guitar. If you have any questions feel free to ask.", "ItemID": "163451238483", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T02:00:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-26T02:00:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Intermark-Cipher-2-electric-guitar-1860s-Japan-Rare-Tiesco-Custom-Paint-/163451238483", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634512384838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BHIAAOSw8LZcItr6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KxQAAOSw9z1cItr2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d5EAAOSwi7VcItr~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ut0AAOSwIAJcItr4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pWYAAOSwlx9cItr0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RFcAAOSwctJcItrz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DikAAOSwjthcItsB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y4MAAOSwtcRcItr7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vLsAAOSwlINcItr9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9MMAAOSwUMBcIuCb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yP4AAOSwwZxcIuCd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15212", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ladyluck1981", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 128, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 177.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 177.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 12}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Intermark Cipher 2 electric guitar 1860s Japan Rare Tiesco Custom Paint", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 420, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 180.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
