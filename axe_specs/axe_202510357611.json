{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Superior tone, twang and mojo-vibe! This guitar is in immaculate condition and a real player - better than new... The only thing preventing me from listing her as \"mint\" are just a few minor wear marks. She is stock except for the notable upgrades which greatly enhance playability and intonation/tuning dependability; - Grover Tuners (period and style correct - original tuners and ferrules included) - Custom-shaped rosewood bridge mount and tune-o-matic bridge (original rosewood bridge-mount and aluminum bridge included) - Strap-lock lug on upper boutProfessionally set-up and maintained. I am the original owner, this guitar was gigged locally for about 6 months and since then, she's never been out of the house... Kept in a humidity-controlled room and in the case. The OHSC is in brand-new condition. - Small ding at the top of the head-stock, no visible buckle-rash, the body is blemish and ding-free, like-new and beautiful! Gold plated bridge and knobs have less than-normal wear/patina. Sweetwater Description and Specs below;If you want authentic Gretsch vibe, you need an authentic Gretsch. And what could be more authentic than this spectacular G6120DSW Chet Atkins? Nothing, unless you're among the lucky few who got your hands on the original mid-'50s instruments. This hollow-body is the real deal, with an arched maple top, a single cutaway, twangin' single-coil pickups, and a genuine Bigsby tailpiece (complete with a vintage-approved flat handle, no less). Love those Western-style appointments? They're all here, from the \"G\" brand on the body to the Western-engraved fingerboard markers to the steer's head headstock inlay.
