{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Completely original with Seymour Duncan JB & \u201859 pickups and licensed Floyd Rose tremolo. Very thin, fast 24 fret neck. No bow or twists. No fret wear. No\u00a0dings or dents. No neck pocket cracks. No broken or repaired neck or headstock. No stripped Allen or any other screws. Extremely low action without buzzing or fretting out. Though the string retaining block fasteners are oxidized, the bridge is in great condition, stays in tune, and returns to pitch after using the tremolo bar. Original hard shell case included. About as minty as you can find for a 1990\u2019s guitar in the lower- middle price range.\u00a0Truly, an excellent guitar at (almost) any price. The only guitar that I own (or have ever played) that is a better player, is my 1978 koa shorthorn USA Supreme BC Rich Mockingbird. About $3700 worth of handmade guitar. I\u2019ve owned/played over 25 BC Rich guitars ranging from $700-$4000 and this plays better than 75% of them. Very unusual. \u201dIf it\u2019s so great, why are you selling her?\u201d -due to severe financial/car expenses (over $7000 of engine and suspension repairs in two different vehicles). I\u2019m selling all but one USA BC Rich guitar and one USA BC Rich bass. I\u2019ve also sold my live rig (VHT 2150 amp, Marshall JMP preamp, Marshall JFX processor, Rocktron INTELLIFLEX processor, and a Marshall 4x12). Happy to answer question or requests for more or specific photos. Will include/attach all questions to this auction so that everyone can benefit. Thanks a bunch! *Some of you may have noticed the Buy It Now price has increased by $50. This was done after comparing this guitars condition to the exact same guitars listed here that have starting bids much higher than mine. The auction starting price is NOT changed. This guitar can still be scored for a very reasonable price.", "ItemID": "163466070503", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T18:34:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T18:34:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-DK2M-Pro-Dinky-Guitar-Snow-White-Seymour-Duncan-Made-Japan-NMINT-/163466070503", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "La Habra, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634660705038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExMlgxNjAw/z/OLgAAOSwl5JcLk9w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mLYAAOSwxO9cLk-V/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I-0AAOSw0vJcLk~F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/h8EAAOSwiwZcLk~D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RvUAAOSwF5VcLk~l/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDEz/z/yBMAAOSw5tNcLk~n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-EIAAOSwHEZcLk~p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bR8AAOSwNphcLlAh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tm0AAOSw0~pcLlAg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90631", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ericmetal", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 350, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 460.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 460.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 499}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson DK2M Pro Dinky Guitar in Snow White Seymour Duncan Made in Japan NMINT", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Pro"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["DK2M Dinky"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Colour", "Value": ["Snow White"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 496, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 465.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
