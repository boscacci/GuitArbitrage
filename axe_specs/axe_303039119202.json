{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A 1997 Fender american standard stratocaster left handed with original red label molded fender case. Guitar is in very good condition and was recently restrung, neck adjusted, and set up so it plays very nice. Body still very clean, the headstock has some wear. Includes a right handed tremolo arm that fits the bridge. Was not played much as the protective plastic is still on the pickguard and back trem cover. All other parts/electronics are original except upgraded Schaller strap lock strap buttons. Case is clean but took a hit on one corner. All latches working. Lower 48 USA states shipping is $49 with signature confirmation. USA Return Policy: Once the buyer receives the item, buyer has a 48 hour approval period and must contact me in that time frame with any issues. I will only accept returns for 'not as described' or 'damaged in shipping'. Items sold as 'for parts or repair' are non returnable. I am an individual (with a Job and Family) who has been selling used music related gear on Ebay for over 20 years with excellent service and my feedback reflects that. Before I list an item, I test it to make sure it works properly. I also take the pictures and describe each item as best I can. Since I sell used gear, I will never use the word 'mint' to describe what I am selling. ALL used gear will have imperfections and I describe them as I see them. The descriptor 'mint' is meant for brand new from the factory items and only authorized dealers get to use it to describe their items. If a buyer has any questions, please ask BEFORE buying. I also ask of all buyers to please do their due diligence to make sure they are fully aware what the item is and that it fits their intended application / purpose. If needed, buyer should get purchase approval from their spouse (or significant other) BEFORE buying. I treat my customers with respect and I ask that you do not treat me like the big box stores like Guitr Center. I thank you in advance for your understanding.", "ItemID": "303039119202", "EndTime": "2019-01-24T14:49:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-23T21:55:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Left-Handed-OHSC-/303039119202", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Orlando, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030391192028080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EKQAAOSwsGpcSORi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r3cAAOSw66JcSORu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qQAAAOSwgZlcSOR5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nhkAAOSwN5hcSOSG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Rw8AAOSwc9VcSOSM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fKsAAOSwiKdcSOSV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JOUAAOSwaiBcSOSi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KoYAAOSwHptcSOSu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O54AAOSw16VcSOL6/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iMMAAOSwqrZcSOS7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "32828", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thegrandhour", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2949, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Fender American Standard Stratocaster Left Handed + OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["American Standard Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 87, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good condition, recently restrung and set up.
