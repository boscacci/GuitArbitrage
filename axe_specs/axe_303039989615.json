{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson ES 359 Custom Shop Bigsby Varitone 335 345 355 Les Paul Custom. Condition is Used. Shipped with USPS Priority Mail. Excellent condition, well cared for, smoke free environment ES-359 with all the upgrades. Nice setup with Bigsby trem and Varitone 6 position tone system. Professionally installed at a handsome expense. It has been a Bigsby dream guitar for me, a tone lover's delight. The pickups are '57 classic humbuckers. The Bigsby can easily be removed if you want to go back to a stop tail piece. It has not been drilled into the body, is anchored into the stop bar pole pieces and touches the finish with a thin felt buffer. The neck is a 12 inch radius, C shape. It's not the Gibson thin neck and it's not the thick baseball bat type neck. The neck strap lock, once moved to the base of the neck has been returned to it's original position. A black wood filler repair covers the hole. Plays like silk and sounds amazing. Comes with original Gibson Custom hard shell case.On Jan-29-19 at 07:03:27 PST, seller added the following information: Hi Friends, appreciate all the interest in this guitar. The initial product description is from Ebay and it states the fretboard is eb-ny. Since I am unable to tell the difference between eb-ny and richlite, I called up Gibson this morning. The serial number of CS250693 indicates this is a 2012 model. After 2010, due to the government raid on Gibson and eb-ny wood concerns, Gibson began using a wood resin composite known as richlite. It looks, feels and sounds like eb-ny. The frequency analysis graphs from high to low are virtually identical when the output charts are laid on top of one another. This guitar has one smooth, hard, thick fretboard. This is what I have learned. Other than this, there are many forum articles on the matter. I've noticed there is mostly positive remarks concerning both fretboard woods. The main thing is tone and Gibson did a great job making sure these high end custom shop guitars stayed true to form. A big hat tip to Gibson Memphis and their highly talented craftsmen.", "ItemID": "303039989615", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T19:19:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T19:19:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-ES-359-Custom-Shop-Bigsby-Varitone-335-345-355-Les-Paul-Custom-/303039989615", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cedar Creek, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030399896158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Vz4AAOSwhu9cSg6K/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0oMAAOSwaSVcSg6c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~kYAAOSwWtFcSg6c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ae8AAOSwEvZcSg6b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lvoAAOSwYwxcSg6b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TAcAAOSwQAdcSg6c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qmsAAOSwl1RcSg6b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ve8AAOSwIndcSg6b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/i2MAAOSwQ5pcSg6a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "78612", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aceevins", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 727, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1824.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1824.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": ".***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2163}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CO", "PA", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson ES 359 Custom Shop Bigsby Varitone 335 345 355 Les Paul Custom", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-359"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["HB008M"]}]}, "HitCount": 621, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1849.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78630879", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
