{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Skunk Baxter Firebird 2013 With one of the most jaw-dropping resumes in music, Skunk Baxter has come to know a thing or two about tone. After playing bass in Jimi Hendrix\u2019s pre-Experience band, Baxter became a founding member of Steely Dan, then joined hit-makers the Doobie Brothers in 1974. As a studio musician for over 50 years, he worked extensively with Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Donna Summer, Ringo Starr, Dolly Parton and many others. His go-to guitar? A Gibson Firebird, naturally\u2014and with that kind of background, you just know that his Firebird is going to be something special.The Skunk Baxter Firebird by Gibson USA is built in the tradition of the original \u201creverse-body\u201d Firebird, with its distinctive looks and multi-piece \u201cneck-through-body\u201d construction for superior strength and sustain. However, a radically new set of Firebird Mini-humbuckers (designed by Skunk Baxter and Jim DeCola), while the hottest mini-hums yet, retain the sweet, dynamic tone similar to that of Gibson\u2019s original \u201957 humbuckers. Route three of these powerful pickups through independent on/off and full/split-coil switching for an insane number of variations and combinations, and this is the most sonically versatile Firebird yet to take flight.The high-quality Tune-o-matic bridge, Lyre vibrato tailpiece, and Steinberger\u2122 gearless tuners deliver consistent performance on stage or in the studio\u2014and when it come to looks, the high-gloss Copper Metallic finish, black plastics, white fingerboard binding, and pearloid block inlays make the Skunk Baxter Firebird a visual treat. Don\u2019t miss out: experience this fabulous Firebird today at your authorized Gibson USA dealer. THE HIGH-GLOSS COPPER METALLIC FINISH, BLACK PLASTICS, WHITE FINGERBOARD BINDING, AND PEARLOID BLOCK INLAYS MAKE THE SKUNK BAXTER FIREBIRD A VISUAL TREAT.
