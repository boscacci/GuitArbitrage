{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Rare 1999 Fender American Deluxe Nashville Edition Telecaster Like New This guitar was purchased new by me from Mars Music and used exclusively for studio work in Nashville. It has probably been played less than 50 hours. It has one little ding on the front where a cable end struck it at some point. Other than that there is some scuffing on the pick guard. I replaced the original tuners (which are included in this sale) with a set of locking tuners that did not require any drilling. I had a string guide from my 1973 Stratocaster placed on the 5th and 6th strings. It comes with the original hard-shell case and all the original hang tags. The guitar and case have been well maintained in a cool smoke-free environment. Thanks for looking! This guitar was only manufactured between March 1998 and January 1999. It has 3 Vintage Noiseless pickups and a 5 way Strat-o-Tele pickup selector. It has a rosewood fretboard, abalone dot inlays, 22 med-jumbo frets, a bound contoured alder body, and a deluxe six saddle string through body bridge. It is the three color sunburst model.", "ItemID": "292621972364", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T02:38:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-06-29T02:13:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-1999-Fender-American-Deluxe-Nashville-Edition-Telecaster-Slightly-Used-/292621972364", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Joelton, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2926219723648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAzM1gxNjAw/z/j6AAAOSwUDZbNYiR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7ogAAOSw2FVbNYig/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTMw/z/zzYAAOSwgu9bNYis/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjQ5/z/YcYAAOSwJ89bNYi6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HUEAAOSwivNbNYjy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HIEAAOSwKqBbNYj6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6a4AAOSw-~NbNYjU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAzMVgxNTk5/z/GDEAAOSw9H5bNYk3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzA1WDE2MDA=/z/DeQAAOSwCLNbNYkQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ETsAAOSwDw9bNYkl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzgx/z/lD8AAOSwfHVbNYjK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDMyWDE2MDA=/z/lLoAAOSwL~hbNYkG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37080", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "davidlynn1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 326, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1825.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1825.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***w", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 134}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rare 1999 Fender American Deluxe Nashville Edition Telecaster Slightly Used", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Delux"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 2191, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
