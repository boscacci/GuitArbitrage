{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Left Handed Gibson Les Paul \u201870s Tribute is in good condition. There are, however, minor chips in the paintwork along some edges of the guitar, due to Gibson upholding the true \u201870s vibe and using a satin nitrocellulose finish, which is easier to wear than a thicker gloss lacquer. There is also a chip in the plastic of the lowest tone knob, but it\u2019s not sharp and the knob is still fully functional. In fact, any wear on this guitar is purely cosmetic. The frets are in pristine condition and all the electronics are factory standard. The guitar came with a pick guard which I have since removed, which has left small screw holes where the pick guard was attached to the body. I will include the pick guard with the guitar. The guitar came with a gig bag, which I will ship the guitar in.
