{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Mosrite Celebrity III Electric Guitar Sunburst 3 Tone Vintage 1960's USA Made Plays and sounds great!! Set up and ready to go. Shows some signs of wear and aging with a few dings and scratches. It appears that the bridge and 1 pickup were replaced. Comes with the extra pickup in the pics. The neck was originally a 12 string and it was altered to a 6 string and then painted around it. There was a small pickguard that was on the front that I removed. You can see the screw holes where it was. The Tuners are Kluson Deluxe, but are too new to be original. Pickguard isn't original. The electronics seem newer. Comes with a cheap padded zipper case to protect it during shipment. With all that, it's a good solid player!
