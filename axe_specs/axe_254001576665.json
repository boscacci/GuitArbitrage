{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am the original owner of this great Rickenbacker guitar. I have only played it a few hours since I bought it new this year. I think it may actually have been made in 2018. I never really bonded with it, so I have decided it is time to let it go. It is in nearly perfect shape, no dings or scrapes. There may be a few very, very fine finish scratches from being handled - but honestly they are so faint I am not sure if they are part of the factory polishing, or anything that was cause by the light playtime I gave this guitar. Included is the factory case, and related paperwork that came with it (minus the warranty card). I only want to ship to the USA, and in fact since there is rosewood in the fretboard I don't think I can ship outside of the USA anyways.I will ship insured and signature required (let me know before bidding if that is any sort of issue). I am selling several other really nice guitars, please check my other auctions!", "ItemID": "254001576665", "EndTime": "2018-12-10T03:15:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T03:15:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rickenbacker-330-Jet-Glo-w-OHSC-USA-guitar-original-owner-excellent-shape-/254001576665", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540015766658080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JG0AAOSwI01b~Y9a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DpoAAOSwC~9b~Y9Z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oCUAAOSwEf5b~Y9a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-gIAAOSwtQNb~Y9b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WqsAAOSwm5xb~Y9a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6MoAAOSwF5hb~Y9b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hdcAAOSwqoxb~Y9b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eeQAAOSwVXdb~Y9b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dEcAAOSwuQhb~Y9c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ScoAAOSwPg9b~Y9b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hWgAAOSwEwhb~Y9Z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xG8AAOSw~flb~Y9a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "20910", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "steadfastsixstring", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 757, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 255}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rickenbacker 330 Jet Glo w/ OHSC - USA guitar, original owner, excellent ++shape", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Rickenbacker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["330"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Jet Glo"]}]}, "HitCount": 188, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1324.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
