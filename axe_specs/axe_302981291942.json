{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Epiphone 1966 SG G400 PRO in the Pelham Blue finish. This guitar is marked USED on the back of the headstock. There are slight paint cracks on both sides of the headstock at the nut. I have owned the guitar for nearly 3 years, and there is no change since I purchased it. The SG has not needed any truss rod adjustments since I have owned it. Mahogany body and mahogany neck, Alnico Classic Pro humbuckers with push/pull coil tap at both of the volume knobs. Wilkinson Deluxe Vintage Classic tuners with aged keys, 'Epiphone' and fleur de leis design on the headstock done in Abalone, Limited Edition Custom Shop label on headstock rear. Rosewood fretboard with pearloid trapezoid inlays, 3-ply pickguard and 2-ply truss rod cover. The guitar is in excellent condition, with only some pick swirling on the pickguard and a very few faint buckle rash markings. There are no nicks, chips or edge marks on the body, the horns or the headstock. From my understanding, the USED designation comes from this guitar being returned and sent to a refurbishing facility. After it was inspected, it was stamped and sold again. The SG sounds great with no buzzing or scratchy pots. Included will be an Epiphone hard shell case, also in excellent condition, with keys and a guitar strap. The SG looks and plays awesome-I just have too many guitars to play them all. Never gigged, only played at home.", "ItemID": "302981291942", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T02:00:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-09T02:00:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-1966-SG-G400-PRO-Pelham-Blue-Epiphone-Hard-Case-/302981291942", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Seymour, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029812919428080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HccAAOSwfQ9b-Ti~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TvsAAOSwMjpb-TjY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3IAAAOSwgVJb-Tj5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FbgAAOSwV0Vb-TkU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/s48AAOSw~llb-Tkx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3-4AAOSwEONb-TlO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lrUAAOSwxG9b-Tlo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yZcAAOSwCTpb-TmJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b5oAAOSwVcZb-Tm5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cfgAAOSwPmVb-TnV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nycAAOSwuMRb-Tnv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ovQAAOSwOIlb-ToQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "47274", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "greenholiday", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 415, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 29, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 357.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 357.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1177}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone 1966 SG G400 PRO Pelham Blue, with Epiphone Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG G400 PRO"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Pelham Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 414, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 362.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
