{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a super nice, near mint condition 2012 Fender Limited Edition '72 Telecaster Deluxe in Tangerine Flake. I bought this guitar new in 2012 and it has never left my smoke free home. It has never been gigged or played out. I've only played it in my basement and it hasn't been played much. The neck and frets are in super condition. The body and finish are near mint, excellent condition. The pictures do not do he sparkle finish justice. All electronics work 100% as they should and the guitar is 100% original. The only reason I don't describe the guitar as mint is due to some very minor pickguard scratches and very, very minor fret wear on the first couple of frets. This series was a FSR (Fender Special Run) and only 300 were made. I thought I'd keep this one for ever but it is time to let it go. You will not be disappointing in this guitar! It will ship in a Fender hard shell case. Below is some info I pulled off of Fender's website with more details. Classic '70s Tele with a Limited Edition Sparkle Finish The Fender '72 Telecaster Deluxe Sparkle brings back a classic and distinctive solidbody electric guitar design, with a cool sparkle finish that's sure to turn heads. In the early 1970s, rock was moving into a \"heavier\" era, and players wanted thicker tone and more sustain than most single-coils could offer. The answer was a Telecaster with humbucking pickups designed by the legendary Seth Lover. This '72 Telecaster Deluxe features those Wide Range pickups, as well as a \"C\"-shaped neck with a large Strat-style headstock, hardtail Strat bridge, and cool, period-correct appointments. Only 300 will be made with this special sparkle finish, so don't miss your chance to rock out with the '72 Telecaster Deluxe Sparkle solidbody electric guitar! Fender '72 Telecaster Deluxe Sparkle Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance: \u00b7 A new spin on the classic Telecaster \u00b7 Wide Range pickups for versatile tone \u00b7 Limited Edition Sparkle finish A new spin on the classic Telecaster In the beginning, there was the Telecaster and the single-pickup Esquire. You could get one in the blond finish and that was it. Over the decades, Fender has made concessions to the changing musical styles and the needs of both novice and pro guitarists, which has led to an astonishing array of Telecasters with new colors, special finishes and upgraded electronics. This '72 Telecaster Deluxe Sparkle sports a new look while paying homage to the early-'70s Telecasters, which players began putting humbucking pickups on to get a beefier tone. Wide Range pickups for versatile tone A pair of Fender's Wide Range humbuckers give the '72 Telecaster Deluxe Sparkle a perfect blend of big, rich tone, output, and detail. You'll love the range of classic tones you can coax from this guitar! And with independent volume and tone controls for each pickup, you can fine-tune your tone to suit virtually any style of music. Limited Edition Sparkle finish While the '72 Telecaster Deluxe Sparkle packs the tone and feel you expect from any Tele, only 300 will be made with this special Sparkle finish. It's a great opportunity to get one of the most-played guitars in history, with a special look that will probably be a premium collector's piece someday. And since it's a true Fender Telecaster, we're sure you won't mind holding onto it for 50 years to find out.
