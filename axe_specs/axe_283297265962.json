{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a great sounding and playing guitar built from leftover red cedar from a garage door project. The Cedar is a very light but resonant wood, and the whole guitar weights in at around 6.5 lbs. It has a nitrocellulose lacquer finish, and the guitar has a nice crisp resnonace playing without an amp. I went back and forth on the color but ultimately wanted to see the red cedar on tope with the relic'ed finish around the sides and back. The G&L Asat Tribut neck is, I believe, about 10 years old so it's nice, dry and stable, with jumbo frets. Spertzel Tuners are near new. I also sanded and finished with an amber nitro cellulose lacquer. Right now the back has a nice gloss finish that doesn't feel plastic like a poly finish, but could be lightly sanded for a flat or smoother finish. It's a great playing neck c shape neck that is a bit thicker than a modern C but has the same 9.5 radius. The P90 is from Guitar Madness and measures 8.09k. The Fender Bridge pickup, I believe, came from a Japanese fender and measures 7.93k. They sound great together. Hear a demo of the pickups clean and with a Mojomojo overdrive through my vox vt40 amp. here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC41eSXGArc", "ItemID": "283297265962", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T00:16:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T00:16:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Red-Cedar-Guitar-G-L-Telecaster-Partscaster-Tele-See-Demo-/283297265962", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Francisco, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832972659628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tFsAAOSwgotcDasN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODM1WDEyNDQ=/z/yxMAAOSwpwBcDavQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Pk4AAOSwAx9cDasc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X7IAAOSw-HRcDari/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PyYAAOSwmepcDark/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wrAAAOSwM6FcDarm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UjwAAOSw1IhcDaro/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TyIAAOSwwFNcDarq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1mkAAOSw9xJcDarr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/abkAAOSwSidcDarz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ppIAAOSweX5cDarv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94118", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "flynnr100", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 108, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 311.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 311.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 211}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Red Cedar Guitar G&L Telecaster Partscaster Tele, See Demo", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Red Cedar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 629, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 316.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
