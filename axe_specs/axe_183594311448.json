{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Mockingbird 7 string in players grade /project condition. Plenty of scratches, dents, chips and dings. Previous owner moved the toggle switch and drilled the hole a little too big so that is why the washer is there. The washer is oversized and should be alot smaller but that is all I had. Volume pot doesn't work properly. Only goes from mid volume to full. Mismatched tuners but they all work. The strings were only put on to test and make sure everything works and are not proper so will need a new set of strings and a setup. Neck was switched by the previous owner for cosmetic reasons and I think he made a good choice. This one looks great and unique on it. All that being said, it does play and sound good. Would be a great gigging guitar or a project to make look great again. Any questions or if you need more pics of specific areas just message me. Shipping price is with the neck off to save on costs and help with safe delivery due to no case.
