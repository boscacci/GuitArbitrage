{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Styling as Agressive as Your ToneWhen you strap on the Schecter Blackjack Tempest solidbody electric guitar, there is no question on what's about to come screaming out of your amplifier. Designed from the ground up to be a finely honed instrument of heavy metal domination, you'll instantly find yourself tearing through your favorite high-gain riffs and leads with reckless abandon. And the Blackjack Tempest is built to withstand playing that is as aggressive as it looks and sounds. Put this Schecter Diamond Series Blackjack Tempest in your hands and nail those riffs to the back wall. Schecter Blackjack Tempest Electric Guitar at a Glance:Aggressive stylingHigh-end Seymour Duncan pickupsNeck built for speedAggressive stylingIn the world of guitar shapes designed for heavy rock guitar, Schecter Diamond Series's Blackjack Tempest has carved its own niche in between classic lines and aggressive departure. And the body shape is only the beginning. The ominous black gloss body is set off by blood red binding on the neck and headstock. The ebony fretboard is minimally adorned with Schecter's red circle inlays. And the all-black hardware finishes the fierce look of this Tempest. High-end Seymour Duncan pickupsTuned for high-gain metal, Seymour Duncan Sentient and Nazgul pickups set the stage for getting the most pulverizing sound out of your Blackjack Tempest possible. The Nazgul is tuned for, as Seymour Duncan puts it, \"...intense high-output, chug-heavy punch-you-in-the-chest ruthless distortion.\" And the Sentient is a great complement, offering subtlety for rich distortion and clear clean tones. And both pickups can be coil-tapped for even more sparkle and tonal versatility. Neck built for speedSo the Blackjack looks mean and sounds mean. But how does it play? Glad you asked. Its 25.5\" scale length is ideal for a slinky feel while mainting string tension, especially when downtuning. The 24-fret set neck is loaded with extra-jumbo frets for effortless bending, and the flat 14\" fretboard radius really lets you bend the high notes without every having to worry about fretting out. Finally, the thin C-shaped neck feels like a dream when what you need is a neck that allows you to fly up and down the fretboard without any resistance.
