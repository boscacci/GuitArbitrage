{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Mid 60's Styled Tribute Relic Stratocaster My guitars are beautifully unique Art pieces and music makers. Each one is designed and built to represent an Icon from the past. They are built with the best parts; commensurate with the price you pay. As a Wounded Warrior, I place integrity, know how, lots of time and love into each of them, as this is also a form of therapy for me. See my feedback, I've been at this hobby for a while. Included with your purchase is a ChromaCast Padded Gig Bag ($50.00) and Fender Custom Shop custom care packet, Owners manual, registration card, hang tags, appropriate tremolo bar, allen wrenches and tremolo back plate - (if needed)! Thanks for looking & check out my other STRATS and Fender parts for sale! For your consideration is this Custom hand restored Stratocaster. I've Styled this after a 1964-65 Stratocaster with the L plate, Rosewood naked neck and 57/62 pickups. BODY: The body has been finished with all the road worn imperfections that would normally come with a fifty-year-old well-played guitar. The body is an aftermarket and is painted in a Translucent Gloss Butterscotch, with what I think is a Poly finish. It has a Translucent finish with hand aged yellowed cream pick guard contrasted with black pick up covers, knobs and switch tip. The pickguard, pickup covers, switch tip and knobs have been hand aged. The Bridge is a Fender vintage big block with American standard wider spacing (2 3/16). NOTE: There's a small space in the neck pocket but it's barely noticeable and the neck is still tight and with all honesty, this guitar neck plays as sweet as my real 65! ELECTRONICS: The Heart has upgraded pickups and electronics. The pick up\u2019s are True Custom Shop 57/62 copper wound Alinco II's fiber bottoms and the wiring is done to vintage 60's specifications. They are staggered, beveled-edge Alnico magnets with formvar wire designed to deliver the original vintage Strat sound, feel, and vibe. It has upgraded new Seymour Duncan Bourns Smooth Taper 250K Split Shaft Speed Pots on the volume and tone, and the capacitor is NOS vintage Fender Bright Orange Dime .022 uF. The wiring is vintage cloth as well. All 5-tone switch positions are distinct and clear; the 2 tone pots work correctly with their corresponding pick-ups. NECK: The neck is a Rosewood cap on maple. It has a mid 60's type naked smooth front headstock (the neck has no truss rod slot on the face of the headstock), and also has a naked back (all smooth maple with no skunk stripe.) The neck is straight (see photo #10) with a C profile, Jumbo frets and the tuners are vintage Kluson style. It\u2019s built in the early sixties tribute style with a 80's Fender (Rare Japan re-issue) 60's neck and small headstock, with a waterslide from the 64-65 ERA. The neck plate is a matching F plate with a mid 60's number and the rare \"L\" in front as they transitioned to CBS. It\u2019s a beautiful machine with a neck radius of 10\" and a string height at the 12th fret of 3/64\". I always setup the neck (truss rod), frets and strings to minimize the string height and fret buzz while keeping the neck as straight as allowed. The neck plays low and easy, with a complete new setup. I've added new Ernie Ball super slinky .09 strings, and then completed a bridge adjustment for perfect string height and playability. Lightweight at 7.5 lbs. I\u2019m a Wounded Warrior and have been rescuing and rebuilding guitars for the last ten years, as a form of therapy. One too many several explosions left me wrapped too tight, (majoranthonyjones.com.) Now, I exercise my brain by playing and rebuilding guitars. I\u2019m wrapped pretty tight so I\u2019m OCD about getting my guitars as perfect as I can, within reason, so you\u2019re definitely getting your moneys worth! RETURNS are NOT ACCEPTED - BUT if you contact me immediately, (7 days) and have not opened or modified the guitar, I will accept return & Buyer pays shipping.
