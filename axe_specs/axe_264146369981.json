{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "USA Auction Only! This is an excellent condition Korean made BC Rich Contour Arch Top Mockingbird guitar in gloss ebony with a nice, plush Paul Reed Smith gig bag ($79.99). This guitar has a very nice build quality and it's set up ready to rock! Neckthrough design with fully bound body, neck and headstock, 24 jumbo frets, cloud inlays, dual high output humbuckers, deluxe tuning keys, chrome hardware. Please review all the photos as they are a part of the description and show the guitars condition and what's included. Overall this guitar is very clean with just light marks and swirls in the clear coat on the front and back of the body. This one being glossy black is pretty hard to get shots without glare but there's no dings, dents or heavy scratches. The jumbo frets are in great shape with minimal wear if any. The plastic film is still on the back control cover plate. The PRS gig bag is very plush and fits this guitar nicely. It's one of the better gig bags I've seen and cost $79.99 on it's own. Condition is very subjective but I describe everything as best I can and I do have a 100% positive seller rating. If you have any questions please ask. *Shipping indicated is for the lower 48 States only. Shipping to Alaska and Hawaii will be higher.
