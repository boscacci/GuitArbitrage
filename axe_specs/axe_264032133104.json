{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is a joy to play and performs flawlessly. I am the original, amateur owner and bought it brand new in 1998. It has only left my smoke free house once. I played at a friends party in 2012...told you I was an amateur! This guitar has had an easy life but there are two cosmetic flaws. First, there is a stain below the pickups where my pinky, ring and middle fingers rest. I have tried rubbing it off with lemon oil but to no avail. The second was \"acquired\" in the summer of 2001 when I lifted the guitar up to adjust the strap and the tip of the headstock took a whack from an overhead fan blade! The case is in great shape and comes with the original tools. I even have some brand new Carvin picks! Once a year I rub lemon oil on the whole thing.C22J and C22B pick ups with coil splitters (to give a faux single coil sound) and an out of phase switch (think of Albert King). Very versatile guitar. Tung oiled mahogany body. Mahogany neck (thru body) with ebony fretboard (12\" radius) and Koa headstock top. Locking tuners. If you win the auction you can pick it up at my house or if you want it shipped I can drop it off at the UPS Store in Brecksville, Ohio but you have to deal with them directly. There number is 440.546.1141. I do not ship or quote prices thru ebay anymore because their shipping cost calculator is very inaccurate. If you want to listen to it or play it contact me. I do no have internet at home and have to use the library's so I may not respond instantly.
