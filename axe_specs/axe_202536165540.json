{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "EXCEPTIONAL CONDITION, GREAT PLAYER! KOREAN QUALITY! NOT made in Indonesia or China. This is an EPIPHONE by GIBSON Les Paul (Standard) flame maple top electric guitar. Serial number U000312xx. Made in Korea, MIK in the Unsang plant, March of 2000. It comes with the gig bag case you see in the pictures. 100% complete. The top and back of the guitar are in near mint condition, with extremely light scratches and some polish swirl. The back of the neck is perfectly SMOOTH! The frets and finger board look NEAR NEW! Looks like it has barely been played. First class guitar, not stamped 'used' or '2nd' like so many here on ebay. Features include... chrome hardware, vintage Kluson style tuners, 22 fret neck with rosewood fingerboard and pearly markers, two original humbucker pickups, three way PU selector switch, tun-o-matic bridge, stop tailpiece, bound transparent red body, single ply pick guard, mahogany body, arched flamed maple top. Professionally set up. Everything works as it should... electronics, truss rod, bridge, tuners, etc. The controls are clean and not scratchy. There was a slight crackle in the tone controls I could not work out, so they have been replaced. This guitar came to me without a pickguard, so I added one. I have serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the neck and body, cleaned and conditioned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the frets, installed new strings (Ernie Ball regular slinky 10-46's), adjusted bridge/truss rod/ intonation, etc. She is ready to play and PLAYS GREAT!!
