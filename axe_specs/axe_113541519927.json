{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is a Kay Electric Archtop that I\u2019ve had a few years. It sounds about like you\u2019d expect it to sound. Plays about how you\u2019d expect it to play. It\u2019s seen a lot of stuff, but considering how old it is? It\u2019s in decent shape! All wear is cosmetic. Seems like most of the wear is from where someone tied a strap on the headstock. The binding is in surprisingly good shape with all of it intact. There\u2019s some wear around the butt of the guitar, where the strap peg is, as well as on the top of the head stock. The pickguard has a crack at the screw that holds it in place, but it\u2019s pretty secure. The action is a touch high but not that bad- prolly needs a good setup to be a good player. Would be killer for slide guitar. Doesn\u2019t stay in tune perfectly, but again, with a little bit of work? It would be a dandy player. The electronics all work well. Has a great grit to it when plugged in. I have not heard it crackle or anything like that. When unplugged, has a biggish sound to it. If you\u2019re looking for that Jack White whiskey soaked grit (insert any other cliche catchphrase) sound... this is your guitar. If you\u2019re looking to play some James Taylor... this ain\u2019t your girl. If you\u2019re looking at this guitar, you know what you\u2019re looking for. The serial number is \u201cL2581\u201d for those of you that want to date it. I love the headstock of this thing. Auction is starting at a penny, with no reserve. Shipping is $50 domestic, because I want to drop this thing off at the ups store and have them pack it and all that. I\u2019ll send you a shipping number. International? I have no idea- call it $150? I could lose bad on that because I haven\u2019t checked out the prices in a while, but that number sounds good. If it\u2019s too much message me and I\u2019ll change it. Live in Kentucky and want to pick this thing up? I\u2019ll meet you at Clamato\u2019s on Versailles Rd, buy you food, and bullshit with you over dinner, so that I don\u2019t have to go to the UPS store. After all, doesn\u2019t like good Mexican food? I don\u2019t know if I have a gig bag laying around for this thing or not. If I have an extra, I\u2019ll throw it in too. Don\u2019t bid on this expecting that tho.
