{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here it is...something a little different...and great. Not a stratocaster,les paul, sg, or telecaster. This model, in this color, is very hard to find. This Wilshire Pro is an excellent playing guitar. It has separate volume and control knobs for each pickup, and INDIVIDUAL coil-split, so you can have the neck humbucker split with the bridge as a full humbucker, or the other way around, in addition to all of the other sounds. Very versatile, and sounds great. It has a few small paint chips (see last few pictures) but playabiliy is excellent. Everything works just as it should. Epiphone's comments: A Blast from Epiphone's Glorious Past! In 1957 Gibson purchased New York\u2019s Epiphone Guitar Company and moved production to Kalamazoo, Michigan. With plans to expand retail distribution by differentiating Epiphone dealers from Gibson dealers, Gibson began production of a new line of \u201cKalamazoo-made and designed\u201d Epiphones in 1959. For over a decade, Epiphone solid body guitars and basses were produced right alongside Gibsons. These Epiphone guitars represented some of the highest quality and best sounding instruments of their generation. They provided unique shapes, pickup arrangements, and tonal signatures not seen on comparable Gibson models of the day. Under appreciated at the time of their release, numerous artists through the years have recognized the unique appeal of these guitars. Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter, Paul Gilbert and Steve Marriot are but a few of the artists that have embraced the tone and build quality of these Kalamazoo built Epiphones. One such Epiphone instrument was the Wilshire. Original Wilshires are selling today for $10,000 or more depending upon condition. Pickup up the new Wilshire PRO today and who knows? Maybe it will be worth that much in 40 years too!
