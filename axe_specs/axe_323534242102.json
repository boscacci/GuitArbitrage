{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For Sale today we have this very nice Dean Z Playmate guitar in all of its Turquoise glory. I believe it to be from the late 80s as the cool color would suggest. This guitar is in truly exceptional shape for its age with only a couple of dings thru the paint that are pictured. It has the typical hairline finish cracks at the neck pocket that you have to hunt. They all have them and they affect nothing. This guitar has been meticulously set-up and it plays effortlessly. The pickups and all of the electronics look original and they sound great. The neck is straight, the frets and fingerboard show hardly any wear, the color is stunning and pointy headstock guitars are on their way back. Enjoy the pictures and ask any questions you have. PayPal only and shipping is calculated according to your location. It will be carefully packed and properly insured for safe shipping. If you have someone who wants to learn guitar on your Christmas list be advised that this guitar smokes anything in this price range and should gain value as it get older and can be truly enjoyed all the while. Don't miss this chance at an 80s rock and roll machine!
