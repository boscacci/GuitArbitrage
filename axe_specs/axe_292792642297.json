{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The ultimate electric hollow body guitar for professionals! Manufacturer: DEAN OVERVIEW The Dean Palomino Electric Guitar has a look straight out of the '40s with a triple P-90 5 switch Strat style tonal attack. The Palomino is a unique electric guitar built for the professional musician to have every guitar sound at his disposal in the studio or gig , fat jazz George Benson , Stevie Ray strat , Heavy rock, country tele sound, this guitar has it all . I'm inspired to share this with those experienced guitarists who are tired of lugging multiple guitars to gigs. I own several guitars and each one has pros and cons. The Dean Palamino arch top is much more gig functional than any arch top in this price range ($500-1000). Why? It's all in the Dean electronics. Plain and simple. None of my current arch tops (all have 2 pick-ups) can match the variety of tone colors available from this triple pick-up with 5 way strat-style switch... One volume, One tone, and 5 pick up combos. Very simple design. Combine that with a full-size hollow body sustain and you can use this one guitar on the gig and play any style, from jazz, blues, classic rock, country, et all. The neck is great, craftsmanship excellent, and it's a very beautiful guitar all the way around. The guitar is in perfect condition, no scratches, niks or fret wear and perfect playing condition. I am a studio guitarist retiring and liquidation all my music gear . I paid over $600 for the guitar and will let it go for half .
