{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a gorgeous Hohner Professional L59 with a beautiful burgundy/cherry flame finish in very good condition. No major dings, scratches or wear. There are a couple small hard-to-see pock marks on the body (see close-up photo). Professional upgrades were made to the guitar by a luthier including Seymour-Duncan pickups (SH-1 '59 Model Humbucker & SH-4 JB Humbucker). The original chrome tuning keys were replaced with Gibson Vintage Les Paul machine heads with an ivory look. The pots were replaced and upgraded, including a push-pull pot for added versatility. I will ship all the original parts (humbucker pickups, pots & tuning heads) along with the guitar in the event you ever want them. Like a Gibson Les Paul, the guitar features a set neck, Tunomatic bridge/stop tailpiece, 3-way switch, 22 fret bound Indian rosewood fingerboard with pearl crown inlay, bound peghead with pearl pineapple logo inlay, solid maple top with a flame maple veneer and black pickguard. Case and guitar strap included. This is a real beauty that sounds and plays as fantastic as it looks. Don't let it get away!", "ItemID": "153268508123", "EndTime": "2018-11-27T01:05:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-20T01:05:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Hohner-Professional-L59-Guitar-w-Upgrades-Case-RARE-/153268508123", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Layton, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532685081238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MjM=/z/KQMAAOSwRYNb81wT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/OzQAAOSw1rpb81w1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/0m0AAOSwF31b81w-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/V8wAAOSwl5Jb81xe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/ZF0AAOSwWz5b81xk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/hnsAAOSwNepb81x3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/i2UAAOSwa3lb81yE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/oGUAAOSw87lb81ye/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMlgxNTk5/z/BG0AAOSwd7Fb810T/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/prwAAOSwylBb810r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84041", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fooddude11", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 116, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 500}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Hohner Professional L59 Guitar w/Upgrades & Case - RARE!\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["HOHNER"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["L59"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["cherry/burgundy"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Case included"]}]}, "HitCount": 81, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
