You are looking at a Vintage 1962 K102 Vanguard. This is a Solid Body Offset Electric Guitar. Has the classic \"DeArmond Pancake\" pickups. Plays and sounds great. Not anywhere close to the quality of a Gibson, but is still a great playing and sounding guitar. If you are into that \"Trashy\" '60s sound, this will do. Guitar is mostly original. The \"Kay\" headstock logo is a reproduction. Other than that, it seems to be all there. Produced as a beginner guitar during the proliferation of rock n' roll during the '60s, the Vanguard has found a resurgence of interest in recent years. Popular with Indie Rockers, these Alternative Throw Back guitars have developed a Cult Like Following. Lots of Fun to play. Has a great Classic tone. Features: offset double-cut slab design, hardwood body, maple veneer top, double pickup Years of production: 1961-1966 Affordable USA Vintage! Our luthier did a complete setup. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Nut Width: 1.68\" Weight: 5.95 lbs. Case is NOT Included! Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. Cosmetics: Good \"Relic\" Condition. What I mean by \"Relic\" is there is some wear on this guitar due to use. Keep in mind that this is a 55+ year old vintage guitar. There are scratches, chips, nicks, dings and dents on both sides of the body. Neck, Headstock and Fretboard in great shape. Very Authentic. Cool wear marks everywhere. Dripping with \"Mojo\". The wear is what gives it it's charm. It is used. Not perfect. Good Condition. Overall, a really nice guitar. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story.
