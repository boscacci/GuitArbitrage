By roasting both the body's ash and the neck's maple, the American Vintage '52 Telecaster rings and sustains with the resonance that used to be reserved for an actual '52. Add in the fact that the Limited Edition American Vintage '52 Telecaster is crafted on original-era machinery, and you'll be hard-pressed to re-create the \"Blackguard\" experience any closer.Meticulous vintage accuracy graces this guitar For the American Vintage Limited Edition '52 Telecaster, Fender tracked down several original '52s and exhaustively analyzed them to ensure a painstaking level of vintage accuracy. Every facet of the original instruments, including minute details such as curves, perimeters, radii and more \u2014 was examined, measured, evaluated, and ultimately incorporated into the American Vintage '52 Tele. What you see in this remarkable guitar is more than the sum of its parts. It's a highly playable, eminently musical-sounding re-creation of an iconic instrument that changed music forever.Roasted tonewoods Fender's American Vintage Limited Edition '52 Telecaster isn't only crafted with vintage-correct details, it actually resonates with the same ring of a perfectly aged vintage instrument. It starts with a roasted ash body that crystallizes the resins and removes the moisture from the ash. And Fender takes the process a step further by introducing the all maple neck to the same process. This thermal treatment creates a wood that reacts much like that of a real 1952 Tele. And a thin coat nitrocellulose lacquer protects and beautifies the instrument.Spot-on '52 Tele tone The Fender American Vintage Limited Edition 1952 Telecaster is fitted with a duet of American Vintage '52 Single-coil Tele pickups, giving you the traditional Tele twang you would expect from this phenomenal guitar. Both pickups carefully re-create the chiming top end and warm lows that made the original instruments the most desirable Telecasters to date. Just ask any of the Tele fanatics here at Sweetwater, the American Vintage '52 Single-coil Tele pickups will get you closer to an original than anything else.", "ItemID": "283287066110", "EndTime": "2018-12-09T19:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T19:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-FSR-Roasted-Ash-52-Telecaster-Natural-2017-/283287066110", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "New York, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832870661108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WmoAAOSwSONcBB2A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/d2IAAOSwrmRcBB2D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wAkAAOSwO-pcBB1n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bewAAOSwmXpcBB1v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/43AAAOSwvqVcBB2K/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Oo4AAOSwPTlcBB2N/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "10031", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "e-shaugn", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 25, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 187}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender FSR Roasted Ash '52 Telecaster Natural 2017", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Special Run"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["52 Tele"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 93, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
