Epiphone Les Paul Custom 100th Anniversary Outfit Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance: About Les Paul Beautiful appointments ProBuckers About Les Paul Much of what we enjoy about modern music and guitar playing can be traced back to Les Paul. His recording career as a solo artist, and as a duo with Mary Ford, generated multiple hit records. He invented the use of multitrack recording and guitar looping and was an early pioneer in the use of reverb and delay. But his most iconic work was done with the solidbody electric guitar. And the sound of music changed forever when Gibson put the Les Paul into production in the early 1950s. Beautiful appointments The Les Paul Custom 100th Anniversary Outfit is dressed up for a birthday celebration. Its truss rod cover, Tune-o-matic bridge and tailpiece, and Grover Imperial tuners are decked out in 24K gold for a regal look. The headstock and fretboard are inlaid in a combination of abalone and pearloid for an attractive contrast to the flame maple top. And this attractive instrument is capped off with a sparkling Zirconium stone inlaid in the dot of the \"i\" in the Epiphone logo. ProBuckers The two ProBucker humbucking pickups in the Les Paul Custom 100th Anniversary Outfit are designed at Gibson's pickup factory in Nashville, Tennessee. These pickups are re-creations of the classic Gibson PAF pickups that are so sought after. Sweetwater players immediately noticed that they offer the same powerful midrange and crystal-clear top end of great vintage Les Pauls. And push-pull pots allow you to split the coils to access bell-like single-coil tones.
