{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I took this guitar on a trade without a case and will include an Epiphone hard case with it. It looks like someone tried to file the binding off the body and left plenty of scratches. The guitar is solid with no breaks or repairs. Has great action and plays great. I do not know what year it is. I tried to show some of the cosmetic damage in the pics but over all guitar looks good for a road guitar. I always start my auction off with the lowest I will take and no reserve but I will add a buy it now price. I will ship priority 3 day shipping by USPS Someone asked the question about cracks or breaks and paint peeling and I couldn't reply back for some reason. There are no breaks or cracks and the finish is not peeling just scratched as shown. The guitar plays very well and has no structural damage just the finish mainly around the binding. Pretty much looks the same as the pictures on front and back", "ItemID": "283331101776", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T18:52:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T18:52:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Hard-shell-Case-/283331101776", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bonifay, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833311017768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yEwAAOSwiqBcM5vm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VewAAOSwH2VcM5vw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6AcAAOSwisxcM5vb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xh4AAOSwkFZcM5v~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IGQAAOSwG49cM5wZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jaUAAOSwEppcM5we/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/36sAAOSwk4RcM5wY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wSUAAOSwGWJcM5wa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U8cAAOSwpTBcM5wc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hMgAAOSwNphcM5we/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32425", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "playitonemoretime", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1014, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 530.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 530.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 44}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Studio & Hard shell Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}]}, "HitCount": 630, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 540.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
