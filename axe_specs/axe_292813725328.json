{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Where to start? You're viewing a 1967 Gibson Es-330 in great structural and playing condition with a straight neck (no twisting or bowing), low easy action, functional truss rod, minor fretwear (mostly on the first five frets), very slight fretboard pitting (but really none to speak of), with the usual checking you see on a 51 year old instrument, but the finish is otherwise in good condition, with a few dings here and there. I believe that the pots, switch and jack are original (thought I can't promise that), and are in perfect working condition. The Gibson P90s are big, bold, punchy and authoritative, with that warm chime and piano-like clarity P90s are famous for. That's the good. As far as the bad (or maybe not bad, if you are looking for a vintage 330 at a great price), when the guitar came to me, someone had routed it for humbuckers and installed crazy-hot '90s Gibson humbuckers. They had also replaced the reflector knobs with knurled Tele-style knobs. At some point too, someone had drilled a hole in the lower bought for either a switch or a master volume and cut a 1\"high x2\" long rectangular piece out of the upper bout and screwed a plastic plate over it. Maybe they had installed an onboard effect and that's where the battery was? Who knows!?! They had also replaced the original bridge with the (I believe) Kluson tunematic that is still on there now and replaced the original tuners with grover Rotomatics. So it was in a bit of a state, but it only cost $1200 (low, relatively speaking, compared to unmolested vintage 330s) and I was looking for a vintage player I could easily restore, so I bought it. I replaced the Grovers with vintage-correct Kluson Deluxe aged white button tuners (as it originally had), replaced the horrible hot humbuckers with genuine (but recent) Gibson P90s (that cover all traces of the routing for the humbuckers), added a vintage-correct, black, aftermarket 330 pickguard, bought some amber (instead of gold) reflector knobs, as I thought they matched the sunburst color better, and patched the holes in the upper and lower bouts. You can feel the outline of the patched areas under the decals; I thought of removing the decals, sanding the areas smooth and re-applying new decals, but decided it was fine as is for a player. If the new owner applied different decals, they could certainly sand those areas down a little smoother, so you can't feel the outline of the patches. Also, both decals are much larger than they need to be to cover the patched areas; the area on the lower bout is about as large as a dime, the area on the upper bout is a rectangle about 2\"L x 1\"H, so much smaller decals or stickers could cover those areas. Now originally, I was going to take it to Third Coast guitars in Chicago and have them refinish the top in some cool color, like gold, so I could have a gold top 330, but I thought I'd see how it looked to cover the repairs with stickers or waterslide decals first, and I found some waterslide decals I liked. Were I to get it refined now, I'd definitely sand those areas a little smoother first. But as I said, I found some decals I liked, thought they looked ok and decided to leave well enough alone. I'm into rockabilly and jazz and jump blues now, but way back when, I was a little punk rocker and that part of me is still there, so I liked the idea of having a cool, old vintage guitar that had a couple of stickers on it. I respect vintage guitars too much to do that to a mint condition guitar, so this guitar was perfect, as I could look like I didn't care enough about vintage guitars to sticker one up, even though I do. Fast forward a few years and I had a car accident that has made it painful for me to look down down and subsequently hard play thin-bodied guitars without pain. As a result, I could no longer play any of my 330s (I had four of them including this one). I'm having surgery to fuse my neck in December and know that even if the pain is gone, it will be harder to look down and will put more stress on my neck, so I decided to sell all of my thin-bodied guitars. I've sold all the other 330s (that were in mint or very good condition) and only this one remains. I knew what the asking price should be for my clean 330s, but really have no idea what the value of this guitar is. It is a great player. It has a nicely rounded C shape neck that is not too deep (like on some 1960s Gibsons), and a super comfy nut width that is maybe a smidge over 1 9/16\". Other than the repaired routes, the replaced tuners and pickups, there have been no repairs and no cracks or breaks. It's a player for sure, but a great player and great guitar if you want to look like you don't care (but really do). Don't like the waterslide decals that are on there now? Just take them off with a little water, use a little Goo-gone to get rid of any residue, and put on the decals or stickers of your choice, but make no mistake, unless you plan to get the top refinned, you will need to cover those areas with something. The guitar comes with the modern Gibson ES case you see pictured, which fits it like a glove and will protect if for years to come. It weighs in at a feather-light 6.3 lbs on my digital scale! I really have no idea of the value, so I'm listing the opening bid at what I paid for it, even though it didn't come with the case I'm including and even though I invested a fair amount of time and money to revive and restore the guitar. For the right person, this would be the perfect vintage guitar, for example, someone who likes vintage Gibson hollow-bodies, but can't afford to drop $3000-$4000 on an all original, clean 1960s Gibson 330, or someone who, like me, thinks the idea of a vintage guitar with a few stickers on it is cool, but can't bring themselves to deface a clean vintage axe. I'm only listing it one time, as I'm having spine surgery in December, so if it doesn't sell, I'm taking it to Third Coast Guitars and having them refinish the top, before relisting it next spring (after my recovery). If I have to do that, then obviously I'll be raising the price by $500, to cover the cost of the refin. So if you are looking for a great vintage player that just drips mojo at a low price (relatively speaking for Es-330s), don't wait, because once this auction ends, there will not be another chance at this guitar at this price. Thanks for looking and please message me with any questions. Note: Ebay no longer lets sellers formally offer a return period less than 30 days, so I have formally listed this guitar with no return option; however, informally, I am offering a 7 day no-questions-asked return policy. If you don't like the guitar for any reason, just message me within 7 days of receiving it and tell me you want to return it and then ship the guitar back to me within 48 hours of telling me you want to return it. I will not pay for the return shipping or refund your original shipping, but I will refund the full purchase price. I feel this is eminently reasonable, as 7 days should be enough for you to determine if you like the guitar and is consistent with what other online platforms like Reverb.com and most bricks and mortar music stores offer. Likewise, if you buy a used instrument from Guitar Center, you have to pay the initial shipping costs yourself, and if you return an instrument to Musiciansfriend, you have to pay the return shipping and they deduct the cost of the initial shipping from your refund (even when they offer free shipping). In my case, I have to limit the return policy to 7 days for this auction because of my spinal surgery on December 12th, so the guitar needs to back to me before December 11th, as I will not be able to lift or carry anything for 3 months after surgery. So only bid on this guitar if you agree to abide by this policy.", "ItemID": "292813725328", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T04:20:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T04:20:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1967-Gibson-ES-330TD-Thinline-Hollowbody-Guitar-Sunbusrt-w-HSC-Es330-/292813725328", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928137253288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzYwWDE2MDA=/z/Mh4AAOSwXx9b6PPt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFgxNjAw/z/hbEAAOSwzCtb6PPq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MDY=/z/gxAAAOSw11Bb6PPy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjU2/z/Fb8AAOSwuvtb6PP2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTc=/z/zWEAAOSw1uVb6PP7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NjI=/z/Q3oAAOSwB19b6PP9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NDQ=/z/JcEAAOSwNYtb6PQD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDc=/z/O7QAAOSwMQ1b6PP5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MjE=/z/NBMAAOSwRBVb6PQF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTkw/z/2C8AAOSwl7db6PQM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NzY=/z/tQwAAOSwwvtb6PQO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjczWDE2MDA=/z/lVEAAOSwOsFb6PPw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53212", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "longboardkitten", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 753, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 10, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "x***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1967 Gibson ES-330TD Thinline Hollowbody Guitar Sunbusrt w/HSC Es330", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Burgundy"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-330TD"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1967"]}, {"Name": "Country of Manufacture", "Value": ["USA"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Laminate"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 613, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great structural and playing condition.
