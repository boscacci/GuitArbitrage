{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Please read entire description before bidding. Up for auction is a used, but in excellent, near mint condition Paul Reed Smith CE 24 in Trampus Green. I had the nut and saddles replaced with a Graphtech String Saver nut and Graphtech String Saver saddles. That is why I didn\u2019t give this guitar a mint rating. Also, I was not able to find the original nut and saddles. This is a fantastic guitar but unfortunately it has to go. This guitar is equipped with the 85/15 pickups and has the push/pull pot for coil tapping. There is also a static cling pick guard that is hard to see in the photos. There is minimal to no wear and tear on this guitar. It is also equipped with Dunlop Strap Locks, a Levy\u2019s strap, and it will be shipped in the original Paul Reed Smith gig bag with tremolo bar and case candy. I ONLY SHIP WITHIN THE LOWER 48 STATES!!! NO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING!!! It will be packaged with care and shipped with insurance. Thanks for stopping by and happy bidding.", "ItemID": "173649593000", "EndTime": "2018-11-24T14:25:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T14:25:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/paul-reed-smith-ce-24-/173649593000", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Weatherford, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736495930008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3zYAAOSw0rdb8sNY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ssMAAOSwXMxb8sNW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BzgAAOSwsupb8sNU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yowAAOSwzDFb8sNc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0joAAOSwwtdb8sNa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aUUAAOSwa3lb8sNe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6U0AAOSwi7Vb8sNP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PjkAAOSwv0db8sNN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZNwAAOSwQZdb8sNS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "73096", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "guitarkid77", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 216, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1040.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1040.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 108}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "paul reed smith ce 24", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["CE 24"]}]}, "HitCount": 486, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1065.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
