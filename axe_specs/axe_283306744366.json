{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Duesenberg model is notable for it's lack of an F-hole, which I personally prefer because i don't like the squeal you sometimes get from F-hole guitars when played at high gain. This guitar is in near mint condition. It has been played a few hours in my studio and it got some play at the shop but there is nothing notable to in terms of wear and tear, dings etc. Just a slight bit of buckle marks on the back of the guitar but you'll strain to see it (see pictures). 100% all original, with case and case candy, wrenches, and more. It has the Dues Grand Vintage pickup at the bridge, and their great single coil at the neck position. Duesenberg Tremelo system which is simply the best trem ever created. I am the original owner. Buy with confidence as i have a 100% satisfaction rating. Please ask all questions prior to bidding (I will do my best to answer them). There are no returns, all sales final. I only sell to the US lower 48 states, and only accept PayPal. I will only ship to a PayPal verified address. I will ship the guitar securely with strings loosened via UPS ground with insurance. Allow up to 48 hours to pack and ship, although i typically ship within 24 hours of payment.", "ItemID": "283306744366", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T21:30:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-17T01:30:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Duesenberg-Starplayer-Guitar-Streamline-Catalina-Blue-Mint-Condition-/283306744366", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833067443668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/~HUAAOSwDFZcCYZX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/ZQ4AAOSwXedcCYY9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/vdQAAOSw~bhcCYY9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/srsAAOSwNUlcCYY~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/magAAOSwrpJcCYY8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/tv8AAOSwnCdcCYY9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/CWEAAOSwEKxcCYY-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/R3QAAOSwtvZcCYY8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60657", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "guitar-amp-exchange", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 34, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 150}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Duesenberg Starplayer Guitar- Streamline Catalina Blue - Mint Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Duesenberg"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 116, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1524.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
