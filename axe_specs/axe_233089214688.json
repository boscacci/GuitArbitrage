{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Jerry Garcia Doug Irwin Tiger Guitar Replica Phil Gawen Grateful Dead Phiga Very accurate replica of the Doug Irwin's Jerry Garcia \"Tiger\" guitar built by custom builder Phil Gawen Gently used in excellent condition. There are a few minor scratches, scuffs, and general light wear from having been played, but there are no major defects or flaws. The brass hardware is slightly tarnished and could be polished should you choose to do so. The jack plate has some finish scratches. There is some minor finish wear around the brass neck runner, and one small finish defect on the neck that has been there since the guitar was delivered to me, and some very light buckle rash on the back. Please see photos for best indication of condition. I am the original owner of this guitar and I purchased it directly from Phil in October 2016. I upgraded the bridge to the correct Kluson Harmonica Bridge and also replaced all screws with the correct slotted brass versions. The guitar has also been professionally rewired to match the original Irwin circuit, including the unity gain buffer, push-pull pots, and stereo effects loop wiring. The case has also been upgraded to an SKB Deluxe SKB-61 TSA approved molded flight case. This guitar really is amazing and has that tone, less Jerry's hands, of course. Guitar weights 9.5 pounds (the original was rumored to weigh over 13 pounds). Frets exhibit little to no wear. The string action is great and is set at 4/64\" on both the high and low E strings, and could probably come down a little if you're a lighter touch player. It's a great playing guitar and really tough to part with for me. The original bridge, original screws, original electronics are included. I will also include the effects loop cable/unity cable. Thanks for looking and good luck. Specifications (from Phil): Body:\u00bd\u201d Cocobolo, bloodwood/maple thru-binding, curly maple, 3/8\u201d book-matched cocobolo.Brass inlayed body top/back & cap.
