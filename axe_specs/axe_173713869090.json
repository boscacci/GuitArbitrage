{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Made in Japan Fender 3-tone sunburst Strat with Large Headstock, maple veneer fingerboard, Custom Shop Quality. This is a really great (1997 from available info)\"Crafted in Japan\u201dFender Stratocaster, resonant and really magical sounding and playing, with a veneer maple fingerboard and large headstock just like the American ones Jimi played, only better! More like Custom Shop quality at a fraction of the price!This one is unusually light at 8 pounds, with an alder body (many USA Fenders with alder weigh well over 10 pounds and sound quite dead!), a real plus for both sound and comfort. This one has a few dings that are normal wear from playing it, nothing bad.So what\u2019s a veneer maple fingerboard and why should you care?Well, almost all Fender maple necks are 1-piece with no glued-on fingerboard,unlike rosewood necks, which have a fingerboard glued on top, though most of those are SLAB boards, not veneer. A slab has a flat surface where it is glued to the flat-topped maple neck. The slab of rosewood is then rounded (radiused) at the top (where the frets go), creating the familiar curved radius (usually rounder on Fenders and less round on Gibsons). In a veneer neck the top of the maple neck is itself rounded, and a wood veneer (with a constant thickness) is heated and bent over the maple. Leo Fender at first made all maple 1-piece necks, then in late 1959 started to use the slab fingerboards (like Gibson used and still uses) because he didn\u2019t like the way maple discolored with use. After a few years he began using the rosewood veneers instead, but did not use maple veneers at all while he owned the company. I asked him about that once and he said it was because veneers made the neck stiffer and more resistant to warping, and it turns out that it also creates more bass volume. As for sound and playability, this is not a good or bad thing overall, just a matter of personal preference. But the maple veneer is quite RARE among Fenders (and allother guitars as well), since they were only made for a few years in the late 60\u2019s in the USA, along with the large headstock, and are more difficult to manufacture. I can tell you that if you tend to like good old vintage Strats you will probably REALLY like this guitar, because it is a truly excellent version of that, for much less money than an old USA model (or a Custom Shop one), and plays and sounds great. The medium C-shaped neck is very straight and the vintage Fender style frets are well-rounded, reasonably tall, and very level, allowing excellent action. It\u2019s 1 9/16\u201d wide at the nut, and on the thinner side there, fattening up as you go up the neck. The body vibrates strongly right into your chest when you play it acoustically in a way that only great guitars do. I won\u2019t even plug in a guitar unless it does that, because the electronics can only amplify what\u2019s there, and if the guitar is dead sounding acoustically then you will also have a dead sounding, but loud, amplified guitar. The bridge it set up so it floats a bit (the way Leo designed it to do), but if you prefer I\u2019ll be happy to adjust it so it lays down flat down against the wood, which makes tuning more stable, especially if you break a string. But floating adds more of the sound of the springs resonance, and allows you to use the trem to bend both up and down, and tremolo a whole chord in a rather beautiful way. The Pickups were upgraded to Seymour Duncan \"Nashville\" (also called the five-two) model American-made vintage style low output single coil pickups which sound like great vintage pickups only better! These have bright yet no ice-picky highs, with very tight clean lows,and are very balanced. The 5/2 has great presence and really cuts through a mix. I added a \"bass plate\" under the bridge pickup to make it sound a bit more like a \"Tele\" in that position, but you can pop it off (it's just held on by wax) if you prefer stock \"Strat\" tone. Or I'll remove it before shipping if you prefer.\"The Five-Two was originally designed for Nashville studio players who wanted to soften the treble attack on their high strings while retaining all of the articulate snap on the low strings. The result was a mixture of alnico 2 and alnico 5 rod magnets that delivers the best of both worlds. The alnico 2 rods are positioned under the G, B, & E strings to provide sweet treble response. The alnico 5 rods are positioned under the low E, A, & D, strings for a bright, snappy tone with enhanced midrange and articulation. This combination results in an all-around well balanced pickup with traditional output that is neither too bright nor too mushy. \"This also has an upgraded steel trem block to improve the sustain and tone, and other little tweaks (such as a treble bleed cap on the volume knob so you don't lose highs as you roll off the volume, and a trem bar with almost no play in it).These are expensive mods but worth it for the tone, taking a really good sounding guitar to the next level! So why am I selling? I\u2019m getting old (just over 72 now) and a bit deaf, plus pretty terrible tinnitus (constant ringing in my ears), and I have way too much stuff (just ask my wife!) So I must tearfully say goodbye to nearly all of it. Sigh. And I\u2019d prefer that I don\u2019t burden my kids with having to get rid of it after I die.I have been selling on eBay since 1997. My eBay user names are edch, and sdhark858, both with tons of great feedback, which you can easily check.In a previous life I founded Guitar Trader in San Diego, and then sold it about 30 years ago. I\u2019ve owned just about every rare guitar (including real vintage 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s Les Pauls, Strats, Teles, 335s, etc etc), as well as just about every old amp and pedal there is. So when I tell you something is exceptional (and really I\u2019ve only kept the exceptional gear) I do have the experience to know. Does that mean you will love what I love? Probably, but it ain\u2019t necessarily so.First off, everyone has their own preferences. Then there is how things are setup. Do you prefer high action or low? Fat strings or skinny? The type of pickups, hardware, wiring, caps, tubes, etc ALL make a difference. Also, somethings work better together, some don\u2019t, so most people find that a Tube Screamer sounds better with a Fender amp than a Marshall,whereas a Fuzz Face likes Marshalls better. So with a different amp or guitar you might prefer something different,plus your ears are different too, so don\u2019t let anyone tell you what you should like;doesn\u2019t work with food, art, music, or anything else, really.So if you play through a Marshall, a Vox or a Fender you might prefer different guitars, effects, and so on for each amp. Jimi used an old coil cord which killed the treble with high capacitance, then used a treble booster. Doesn\u2019t matter, it WORKED! I never argue with what works :<) Fun link about simulating old coil cords:premierguitar.com/articles/The_Vintage_Coiled_Cable_Simulator_Mod Willing to ship internationally if I can do so safely.", "ItemID": "173713869090", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T07:08:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T01:41:54.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-69RI-Large-Head-1997-Japan-Veneer-Maple-JIMI-/173713869090", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "San Diego, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737138690908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/JOUAAOSwO-hcJ9w6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/zMMAAOSwiqBcJ9xP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/GFwAAOSwTDpcJ9xX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTEwWDc2OQ==/z/fxYAAOSw-HRcJ9xb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/1fYAAOSw5bxcJ9xi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/d48AAOSwSONcJ9xo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/KMUAAOSwFtNcJ9xu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/kHgAAOSwXF5cJ9x0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/jCwAAOSwfMlcJ9x6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92122", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sdhark858", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 154, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 766.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 766.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 260}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster 69RI Large Head 1997 Japan Veneer Maple \"JIMI\"", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["60s Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 272, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
