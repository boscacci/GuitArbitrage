{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "In very good shape, I\u2019d give it a 8/10. No major scratches or dings. Only place that shows any wear is the pickguard which has some scratches from being played and the chrome hardware, which is faded a bit and the tuners show some pitting which you can see in the picture. The pickups covers and other chrome hardware look just fine, they\u2019re just not quite as shiny and reflective as they were new. I took a picture of my hand over the pickup in the last picture so you can see it still looks good, just not as clear as it was new. If you saw a listing similar to this one, with a similar price, it is because I was selling one for my friend, and now I\u2019m selling this one which was mine lol.", "ItemID": "283353280868", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T04:29:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T04:04:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-SG-G-400-Electric-Guitar-/283353280868", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bluffton, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833532808688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dXIAAOSwbKVcS9lt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wQcAAOSwlLVcS9ln/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Lj4AAOSwWapcS9lr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vdoAAOSwiudcS9lk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IJAAAOSwLNxcS9lp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aRYAAOSwcOZcS9so/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aRgAAOSwcOZcS9sq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "29910", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "herrininc", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 383, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone SG G-400 Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG"]}]}, "HitCount": 335, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
