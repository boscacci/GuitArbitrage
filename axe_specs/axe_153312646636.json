{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "We originally sold this guitar earlier this year and it was traded in on a custom build model for the customer. Neck pickup was replaced with a Duncan Duckbucker, but the original p/up is in the case. Excellent condition. One little dent on the side of the upper bout. Nothing else that I could find. Plays like butter. Cool No-Logo headstock. Come with the original hardshell and all paperwork. Satin Vintage tint neck with a 9 1/2\" radius, 1 11/16th nut. This probably sold new for over $1300, so this is a good buy. We are a small, service oriented, pro shop that has been in business for over 37 years.
