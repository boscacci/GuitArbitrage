{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am putting this PRS up for bid and it is a great find. I bought this about a year ago and it came as you see it in the pics. There is one major blemish on the upper bout right where the neck fits into the body. This blem in no way affects the playability of the guitar. I need to mention that the tone knobs and the pup switch work great. The two smaller flip switches were installed aftermarket by a prior owner is all I can figure? They are not wired and do not function. Again, it was this way when I purchased this instrument. I will say again that the original switch and knobs work flawlessly with no crackling or hissing. The neck has not been out of this guitar and is easily determined because of how PRS guitars have set necks. See the pics for best visual description. The frets are excellent. The neck is quite straight. The tone and sustain are even better than stock with these EMG\u2019s. I am throwing in this HSC which is in great shape and no torn tolex and no smells. I play at home and don\u2019t gig or smoke so no issues there. I am starting this bid low and know this one will make someone a great guitar.", "ItemID": "143010013329", "EndTime": "2018-11-16T22:30:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T22:30:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-Paul-Reed-Smith-SE-Custom-Made-Korea-HSC-And-Friedman-EMG-Pickups-/143010013329", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Huntsville, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430100133298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vXIAAOSwr-Bb325m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WUMAAOSwxLdb325o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDU4Mg==/z/dqoAAOSwyulb33NU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY2WDU2NQ==/z/RfwAAOSwWB5b33OE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/S-gAAOSworhb325u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vzIAAOSwXx9b325w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qCkAAOSw0d1b325z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oioAAOSwrblb3251/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0N1g1MDE=/z/PCMAAOSwMxJb33Nq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "35801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "2909chrisr", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1078, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 10, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 191.38, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 191.38, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 927}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS Paul Reed Smith SE Custom Made In Korea With HSC And Friedman EMG Pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["D2TD03MT"]}]}, "HitCount": 195, "Subtitle": "Comes with nice hard shell case and EMG PUPS", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 193.88, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "219452161", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
