{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Tyre kickers welcome, reasonable offers considered. Local Pickup available in Providence, RIFor sale here is a Brian Moore i1F. Hard instruments to come across, and this is a great find. One of the best sounding and most versatile guitars I've ever played. Two coil-tapped Seymour Duncan humbuckers give that Les-Paul and PRS type snarl, You're pop them into single-coil mode and you have that awesome, bright sound of the strat. If that isn't enough, the center strat pickup is the finest sound pickup I've ever heard - so much so that I installed one in my telecaster. Selling this guy as I am typically too nervous to bring it to gigs lest it get hurt. This was my go-to recording guitar for three records and a film soundtrack. I'm sad to let it go, but would be thrilled if it ended up in a good home. Selling with a hard case. Guitar is in excellent condition, with one tiny defect in the finish behind the headstock. The hard case is perfectly functional, but has some cosmetic damage.
