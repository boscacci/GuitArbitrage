{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1980's JAPANESE KRAMER FOCUS 1000 GUITAR WITH GIG BAG NO RESERVE!! Up for bids is a vintage, made in Japan Kramer Focus 1000 from the 1980's. This is a single pickup model with a single volume knob and it's finished in candy apple red. It has chrome hardware including a Floyd Rose locking tremelo complete with arm. It currently has a chrome cover Gibson U.S.A. humbucker wired straight to the output jack but it comes with what I believe to be the unmarked original 4 wire humbucker, and the original pot and capacitor are still installed. It looks like the plastic plate around the jack is a replacement but everything else looks original to me. The guitar shows some pick marks and small dings and nicks like you would expect on a 30+ year old guitar. There is some playing wear on the back of the neck but nothing major. Like a lot of these there is a tiny crack on the back of the neck where the locking nut screws go through. It was too small to show up much in the photos and I don't think it will ever be a problem but I wanted to be sure to mention it. The neck is straight with comfortable action and the frets have lots of life left in them (no buzzing or problems). The pickup sounds great both clean and with overdrive. It comes with a non-original case. I don't see these Japanese 80's Kramers very often these days, especially in decent condition. I'm going to offer this one with NO RESERVE so bid to win! U.S. shipping will be $55 (more to Alaska and Hawaii).
