Music Man JPXI BFR 6 Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance: Designed for fast, precise playability Cover a wide tonal range Music Man - the pro's choice A collectible Ball Family Reserve instrument Designed for fast, precise playability The Music Man JPXI gives you the ultimate in playability. John Petrucci is a guitar legend, famous for his astonishing technical prowess and his systematic demolition of musical boundaries with Dream Theater and Liquid Tension Experiment. This man knows exactly what he needs in a solidbody electric guitar. Since his first Music Man signature model, John has been working with the company to refine the concept. Continuing the enormous success of the JPX, the JPXI BFR 6 is a superbly balanced instrument, and thanks to its sculpted alder body, it's supremely comfortable - John thinks of his talented hands as being \"average-sized,\" and this is reflected in the extra-slim neck taper - a profile also favored by a broad swath of guitarists. Add to that a premium ebony fingerboard and 24 medium-jumbo stainless-steel frets, and you've got a high-speed, low-drag shredding machine. Cover a wide tonal range The Music Man JPXI BFR 6 makes you a master of the tonal universe. Its lightweight alder body contains a mahogany Tone Block and is topped with maple - a unique tone cocktail that gives you wonderful warmth and resonance you don't expect in a solidbody, along with prodigious sustain. Two DiMarzio humbuckers - a Liquifire (neck) and Crunch Lab (bridge) - serve up a universe of tone that takes you from chimey cleans through a wide range of delectable crunch, all the way to fearsome, face-melting shred. But there's more: a custom piezo floating vibrato bridge lets you engage in vigorous whammy action with absolute tuning stability, while giving you access to a range of gorgeous, nuanced acoustic sounds. Tonally speaking, there's very little this exquisite axe can't do for you.
