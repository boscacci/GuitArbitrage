{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is THE Custom Shop Jeff Beck Signature Strat. And yes, it's the bad-ass of all bad-asses. I have this one set up and ready to ROCK right out of the case. Took out the original Fender Noiseless pickups because they sounded like crap. This baby is rocking the Seymour Duncan \"Everything\" pre-loaded pickguard. You can check that out here: https://www.seymourduncan.com/pickup/everything-axe-pickguard It's the JB Jr. pickup in the bridge, the Duckbucker in the middle position, and the Little 59 in the neck position. This baby is ready to rock, get funky, and get bluesy. I also replaced the original pot-metal trem block with a big steel block that adds mass and depth to the sound. Replaced the regular trem springs with \"Noiseless\" springs to get rid of any noise/clangy reverb in the trem cavity. Put on a custom \"short\" trem arm for more control of the tremolo. And the guitar comes from the factory sporting a roller nut and Sperzel locking keys. This guitar SINGS. And stays in tune. Just a total monster guitar. I'm also including two extra pre-loaded pickguards. One has a Duncan JB Jr. in the bridge, Fender noiseless in the middle, and single coil in the neck. The other is a Lace Sensor pre-loaded \"Hot Gold\" pickguard. I also have the original long tremolo bar and the original pot-metal trem block that I'm including. Look...this isn't one of those toys they sell at Guitar Center. This is a hand made Jeff Beck strat straight from the Fender Custom Shop. This guitar sounds great and plays like an absolute dream. Brand new it was over $4,000 This is your chance to own the Stratocaster of your dreams at a bargain price. This guitar is calling your name. It belongs in your hands right now!", "ItemID": "292887253351", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T00:01:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-23T23:17:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Artist-Jeff-Beck-Signature-Custom-Shop-Electric-Guitar-/292887253351", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928872533518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/cncAAOSwgq9bktnm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/ipsAAOSwDftbktnn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ5WDEwMDA=/z/sZUAAOSwwVBbktno/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ5WDEwMDA=/z/kp8AAOSw3G9bktnp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/th8AAOSwm9lbktnq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/KD8AAOSwRPhbktnq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/E7YAAOSw3kxbktnr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQ5WDEwMDA=/z/HMIAAOSwmrpbktns/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "89131", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "robbieboyette", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1457, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 108}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Artist Jeff Beck Signature Custom Shop Electric Guitar", "HitCount": 7, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "A player's dream!
