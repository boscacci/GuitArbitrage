{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a 2017 EVH Striped Series Electric Guitar in Black with Yellow Stripes (Eddie Van Halen's famous \"Bumble Bee\" color pattern). This model includes the D-Tuna feature on the Floyd Rose bridge, allowing for quick changes from standard to drop-D tuning. This guitar is practically new. It's been played maybe a dozen times and has never left my home studio. The finish is perfect, as are all hardware and electronics. It sounds great and plays wonderfully. The fretwork is consistent with the high quality seen on Mexican Stratocasters and the action is low and fast. I restrung the guitar in November and it required no other adjustments. It is currently tuned in standard, one-half step down, as was typical for many Van Halen songs. Come get a brand new quality axe at a used price! I only ship to the continental US. I only accept PayPal payments. I ship in the original boxes with insurance.
