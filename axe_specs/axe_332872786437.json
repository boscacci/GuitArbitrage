{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This auction is for my absolutely perfect 2013 Gibson SG Standard Cherry electric guitar and plush case. Here's the story. I'm a 67 year old guy who thought I was going to get back into playing. It's never happened. This guitar has, at most, 3 hours of playing time. It was ordered in for me by Guitar Center, here in Madison, WI. It wasn't a display model that had been handled by 100+ people. It was shipped to Guitar Center, I was the first guy to open the shipping box, and the only one who's ever played it. It is perfect in every way. (OK, I pulled the pick guard plastic off...)I even have the original case box and outer shipping container box which will be used to ship to the lucky buyer. Finally, it comes from a smoke-free, pet-free home. I'm just not using it, and cannot justify having it hang on the wall any longer.", "ItemID": "332872786437", "EndTime": "2018-11-15T17:47:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-08T17:47:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2013-GIBSON-SG-STANDARD-CHERRY-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-MINT-ONLY-3-HOURS-PLAY-TIME-/332872786437", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Madison, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328727864378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDU5/z/1zAAAOSw7PJb41x2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDU5/z/EUQAAOSwGYhb41x5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDU5/z/1BAAAOSwihVb41x7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDU5/z/LJYAAOSwESRb41x-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzc=/z/po4AAOSwOVlb41yA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/Pu0AAOSwjNdb41yC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/xHEAAOSwd2Zb41yF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/L8cAAOSwWV1b41yH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/rusAAOSwQZVb41yK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/4moAAOSwIDJb41yM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDU5/z/CycAAOSwVH9b41yP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/4vcAAOSwww9b41yT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53719", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bigdyb1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1654, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 14}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2013 GIBSON SG STANDARD CHERRY ELECTRIC GUITAR - MINT -  ONLY 3 HOURS PLAY TIME!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 213, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Only 3 hours play time!
