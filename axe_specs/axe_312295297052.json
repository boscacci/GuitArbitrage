{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This instrument is virtually mint. It plays like a dream and sounds just wonderful. It also comes with original case, which is in very good shape--just a few scuffs. From what I've read, Fender made Squire Strats in the U.S. for only nine months. They did so while waiting to shift production from one Asian country to another, though I don't know from or to which. This makes this guitar particularly desirable for collectors, but it's not just a showpiece. It's a great instrument that deserves to be treated with the same care it's gotten so far. As for flaws: I found one tiny, tiny, tiny indent in the top finish, which I mention only in the interest of full disclosure. It's as far from a deal-killer as you can get. Any other imperfections you'd have to find with a magnifying glass or maybe bright light. The pick-up selector lever has a hairline crack, but it's intact. One of the tone pots is scratchy, but a shot of de-ox should clear that out. I've slightly overestimated the weight and size of the package to reflect the additional cost of insurance; Ebay's estimator does not include insurance in its invoices. But buyer will pay ACTUAL shipping and insurance cost, and I'll try to keep it as low as I can. I will not overcharge for shipping.", "ItemID": "312295297052", "EndTime": "2018-11-10T20:39:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-03T20:39:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1989-Fender-Squier-Stratocaster-U-S-Near-Mint-/312295297052", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Point Reyes Station, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3122952970528080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIyM1gxNjAw/z/KM4AAOSwWa1b4fJn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTkzWDE2MDA=/z/keEAAOSwMBdb4fJh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFg3MjA=/z/v4wAAOSwZddb3gG9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFg4MTA=/z/rdkAAOSwpY5b3gG6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDEwODA=/z/yokAAOSwUalb3gG~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDEwODA=/z/IMYAAOSwrblb3gHC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDEwODA=/z/8bgAAOSwMQ1b3gG7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyOVgxNjAw/z/SesAAOSwS6pb4fJc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "94956", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jdeitch11", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 430, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 6}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1989 Fender Squier Stratocaster U.S. Near Mint", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1989"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Squire"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 231, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 404.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
