From its basswood body to its maple neck and fingerboard, this guitar just screams quality. This amazing guitar is made for serious playing, with a compound-radius fingerboard, an EVH Floyd Rose bridge and locking nut, and direct-mounted EVH humbuckers. You also get two domed black knobs for total control over your tone and volume and ultra-stable EVH tuners. All the components come together to make a high-performance electric guitar.Graphite-reinforced neck for stability and playabilityThe neck is one of the most important aspects of any instrument, which is why this EVH Wolfgang Standard's bolt-on neck is reinforced with graphite, offering amazing stability. You'll also love the playability and feel of the compound-radius fretboard on this Wolfgang Standard. The fretboard radius goes from 12\" at the nut to a comfortable and flat 16\" radius on the upper frets.Floyd Rose tremolo allows for twisting, bending, and huge dive-bombsFirst gaining popularity in the 1980s, the Floyd Rose tremolo's locking design keeps your guitar in tune - even if you like to perform extreme pitch pyrotechnics.
