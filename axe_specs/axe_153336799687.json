{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Having to sell my beautiful Fender Squier Deluxe Stratocaster. This Strat has been completely upgraded with Fishman Fluence Active Pickups in a Prewired Pickguard (including all tone pots and volume pots) ($299.95) with the optional battery pack ($99.00) installed on the back. The Fishman Fluence Pickups are completely silent and sound fantastic! See this video: https://youtu.be/oZSS13d3vZs You can see the pickguard and read the reviews here: https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/FluenceStratPGW--fishman-fluence-stratocaster-loaded-pickguard-white It has two push pull knobs for added tonality. To charge the battery, just plug in a mini USB cable into the back plate and a light turns green when its fully charged. It also has an indicator light that flashes red when there's about 10 hours left on the battery life. One complete charge lasts about 300 hours. I hate to sell this girl, but I need the money to pay medical bills (I recently had a heart attack). The neck is maple, 22 frets, no fret wear AT ALL. This guitar IS IN DEAD MINT CONDITION, NOT EVEN BUCKLE RASH. It doesn't have a scratch or ding on it. It's been a joy to play this guitar (what little time I did get to play it) and its never left my house. It also has been upgraded with LOCKING TUNERS. This guitar sounds and plays as well as any American made Stratocaster. It is modeled after the famous Jimi Hendrix white Woodstock Strat that he played at Woodstock. The color is a metal flake white. I cannot get a good photo of the metal flake but you'll see it when you get it. This is one of the best upgraded Squiers you'll find. There is nothing left upgrade. I've upgraded everything! I EVEN UPGRADED THE NUT TO A BRASS COMPENSATED NUT. ALL SALES FINAL, NO RETURNS ACCEPTED. Like I said, I have to pay medical bills, so I cannot offer returns on this item. No case is included, but it will be professionally boxed and shipped. PAYMENT DUE AT END OF AUCTION. CONTINENTAL US ONLY. Sorry, cannot ship overseas.
