{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am trying once again to thin out my herd of stringed instruments. It\u2019s getting harder and harder since I am attached to all of them at this point. Here we have a WAY cool, top of the line, rare and out of print Jay Turser Warlord with a hardshell case. The pictures say it all. This is one of the premier Jay Turser designs from their heyday working out of the Chinese factory in the late 90\u2019s early 2000\u2019s. The attention to detail is stunning, check out the binding and the truss rod cover. These stock pickups I\u2019ve never seen in another Turser. I put a roller bridge on ($23.95) on but I believe the rest is stock. The metal half-moon tailpiece shows some tarnish, and there are a few very minor swirls but no dents, scratches, cracks or chips on this guitar. She is a looker and a player., The case is included and is oversized so the shipping will be $65, bubble wrapped and overboxed. *there is a tiny dent up high on the neck, you can see it in the photo of the back of the headstock It ships in a hardshell case. The outside of the case has some wear but the velvet inside is in great shape. The case is big so shipping is $65 for this one. I ship FexEx, I actually take a bit of a hit on the shipping but I like the tracking and reliability. Check out my other auctions, I will be listing about 20 guitars and basses and microphones in the next few months. I ship fast and currently own a 100% feedback rating as a buyer and seller on EBay (860+ transactions, a member since 2001).", "ItemID": "264035593110", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T22:59:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T01:28:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jay-Turser-RARE-Warlord-V-style-Electric-guitar-GORGEOUS-Hard-Shell-Case-/264035593110", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ogden, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640355931108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDUxNA==/z/9-gAAOSwU1Nb6NXY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDUxNA==/z/hUIAAOSwYh9b6NXX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDUxNA==/z/FeIAAOSwDP1b6NXX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDUxNQ==/z/0-IAAOSw5oxb6NXX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDUxNA==/z/2TwAAOSwXOhb6NXY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/XgoAAOSwHGxb6NXY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/p9kAAOSw2yVb6NXZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDUxNA==/z/FNsAAOSwH0Vb6NXZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/2aUAAOSwdzhb6NXZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/dKQAAOSwUqVb6NXa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/QxEAAOSwN5hb6NXZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blindedbyreality", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 886, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 528}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jay Turser RARE Warlord \"V\" style Electric guitar GORGEOUS!
