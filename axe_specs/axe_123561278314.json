{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a very nice 2011 Carvin SC90 guitar. This guitar cost right at $1200.00 new in 2011. It is in excellent condition with no dings, dents or repairs. It has some slight signs of use from where my fingers touched the area below the treble E strings in the finish while playing. You could even probably buff that out. The guitars options are a flamed maple book matched top, rounded body edges, black ebony fretboard, mother of pearl block inlays, matching headstock finish with flamed maple cap as well, Sperzel locking tuners, Dunlop dual design strap buttons installed, back of neck is a satin finish, gloss body finish over a tobacco sunburst, black hardware , maple neck thru design with alder body wings. I cannot remember the exact model of humbuckers but they are original Carvin with 3 way selector with 2 volume and 2 tone knobs. The factory Carvin tweed hardcase is included. This guitar plays very good and sounds excellent too. If you have never played a Carvin, the quality of the fit and finish is outstanding. This is a lot of guitar for the money compared to what you have to pay for a similar quality and options on new guitars currently. Buyer will be happy!! Buyer to pay $45.00 shipping to lower 48 states. If you have any questions please let me know. I also have other guitar stuff listed if you want to take a look.
