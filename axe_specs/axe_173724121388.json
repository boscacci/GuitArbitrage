{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a 2002 ESP/LTD SC-500 Stephen Carpenter (Deftones) Signature Series electric guitar. There is now a 20th Anniversary reissue version. This is from the original run, made in Korea, inspected in th USA. These seem to be fairly rare. It was a little hard for me to find an exact match to this piece, but I believe the body is alder, neck is maple and fretboard is rosewood. One volume, one tone, 5 way switch, 2 humbuckers and one single coil pickup. This guitar is loaded with all Seymour Duncan pickups. Bridge-SH8SGN...SYNSTER GATES INVADER Middle-SH8SGB...SYNSTER GATES INVADER Neck..-STK-S4N...CLASSIC STACK PLUS STRAT The first two are very powerful passive pickups and the single coil would be a beefed up Stratocaster type pickup. This guitar has been played, has two healthy dings, top back of headstock and bottom right back. Some scuffed areas on front near pickup, bridge, and switch where some one made some bad use of a small buffing tool. Otherwise there is typical scratching and wear on a guitar that has probably seen stage use. The guitar still presents well and would still look good on stage. The frets show wear but are still playing well with plenty of metal left for some filing and dressing. Electronics work as they should, truss rod adjusted, intonation adjusted, action is low and fast, tuners working smoothly. Original case included, a little rough but solid. Check out pictures and ask questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed. Check our seller rating and feedback. I sell the guitar stuff and pack carefully and ship promptly. Sales are intended to be final..thanks for looking...", "ItemID": "173724121388", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T17:20:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T04:04:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-SC-500-ORIGINAL-STEPHEN-CARPENTER-SIGNATURE-SERIES-SEYMOUR-DUNCAN-/173724121388", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bettendorf, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737241213888080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wxUAAOSwzaJcDVp8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7r0AAOSwZtRcDVr6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LFMAAOSwpudcDVsD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~38AAOSwF5hcDVu3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FvQAAOSw3T5cDVtJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/59oAAOSw~llcDVsT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/974AAOSw-HRcDVsi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1hUAAOSwqnVcDVsp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UqQAAOSwDPNcDVss/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8qQAAOSwO-pcDVs1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IjUAAOSwhspcDVs8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fZAAAOSwLgpcDVs~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mychildren5-2008", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2011, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 339.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 339.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 258}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP LTD SC-500 ORIGINAL STEPHEN CARPENTER SIGNATURE SERIES SEYMOUR DUNCAN", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP/LTD"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid neck-thru"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SC-500"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["See thru Green"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Signature Series"]}]}, "HitCount": 94, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=847815792", "StoreName": "Bargain Charlie&#39;s"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 10, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Some blemishes, plays and sounds great", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
