{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Other than a few minor pick marks- MINT condition. No fret wear, no dings, dents, scratches, buckle rash, etc. All electronics up to date, factory models installed and all working as it should. You will not see this combo of Sunburst body with a maple neck. I put this neck on myself. Plays great, nice low action. This has been in my closet for a while as a spare, never had occasion to use it, so it's time to thin the herd. Shipping quoted is for lower 48 only, Please ask any questions. The case is missing the shoulder strap on back (?). all zippers work on both pockets and case with no issues. All original accessories included. This is not an aftermarket replacement neck. It was swapped from a black body JTV69s. (Maple neck was not offered on a sunburst body) , so there are no modifications or \"retroffiting\" done. It is an exact part for part swap.. This originally had the standard rosewood neck. I just preferred the maple neck.", "ItemID": "332976865321", "EndTime": "2018-12-26T20:44:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-25T13:15:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/L-ine-6-Variax-jtv69S-/332976865321", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Largo, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329768653218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5MVgxNjAw/z/ndsAAOSw19dcGliv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4IYAAOSwK5tcGli0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjMzWDE2MDA=/z/kgYAAOSwTEZcGli3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDY5/z/fyIAAOSwlelcGli9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2FQAAOSwWI5cGljC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDE2MDA=/z/AiwAAOSwXi9cGljF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTgxWDE2MDA=/z/sMoAAOSwkjJcGljO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Y6EAAOSwi3xcGljS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cgEAAOSwxx1cGljW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33771", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bob1474", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2102, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.7, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 616}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "L:ine 6 Variax jtv69S", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Line 6"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 17, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
