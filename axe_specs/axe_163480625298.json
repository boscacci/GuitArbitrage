{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a 1980 Gibson ES-335 in a factory original Walnut Brown finish. This guitar has average type of playwear - but it's in good condition and has no headstock breaks or repairs. The serial number is 827306xx The finish has a good bit of playwear - scroll down to see pics. There's a few little indents, small chip on the tip of the headstock, light scratches, some light finish checking and marks on the top and back- see pic's. There's some finish wear on the back of the neck as well. The pickups are the original Gibson Epoxy back or \"tarback\" pickups. Back in the late 1970's and early 1980's, Gibson potted them in epoxy for a super clean PAF sound, with absolutely no micro-phonic feedback. Then it can be cranked up to take advantage of the pickups clarity and crunch at volumes that would be tricky to control with a regular unpotted one.
