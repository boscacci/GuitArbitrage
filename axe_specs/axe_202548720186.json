{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "REVEREND SIX GUN III w/HEAVY PADDED GIG BAG & UPGRADED TUNERS Very good condition! Rare find! Up for sale from my personal collection is this Reverend Six Gun III with the very hard-to-find \"David Gilmour Black Strat\" color scheme (black body, black pickguard, maple fretboard, white pickups). The stock pickups are excellent, and the effective tone controls (low pass and bass contour) will let you take advantage of their brightness and body to get EXACTLY the strat-style tone you are looking for, every time. It has a pro setup with fresh D'Addario 10-46 strings, and I upgraded the stock tuners to Gotoh magnum locking tuners. Other than that, it's all stock. I strive for accuracy when I photograph a guitar, and I feel a little guilty about this one, because the photos make it look like this picture is near-mint condition. In reality, there are a lot of light swirl and pick marks, and a couple of very minor dings that I simply could not capture in photographs, no matter the lighting or angle. But the truth is, it is a proven workhorse, it is a very handsome guitar, and if you know your David Gilmour, then (like me) you'll have a hard time passing this one up. It plays, sounds, and looks amazing! I am including a very nice Levy's heavy padded gig bag with roomy pockets, sturdy canvas handles and straps, and interior neck support. I think you will really like this gig bag. There is some minor fret wear, shown accurately in photo #4. Will ship FedEx Ground. Please let me know if you have any questions. Just a killer guitar.
