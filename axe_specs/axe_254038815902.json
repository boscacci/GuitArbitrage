{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is an original Joe Bonamassa model 2012 Gibson Les Paul Gold Top Standard, serial number 133320549, in excellent condition. Gibson has inscribed the signature 'Joe Bonamassa' on the truss rod cover, as seen in the close-ups. We understand there were only about 200 of these guitars manufactured by Gibson. We just acquired this guitar from the original owner who met Joe in Albuquerque NM in 2015 and got Joe to actually sign the pickguard, as seen in the last picture with Bonamassa holding the guitar while signing it. Joe also signed a 2012 L.P. Studio Goldtop (Bonamassa model) that we have also listed now on eBay for $1,595. Since 2015, both guitars have been on display at the home of the original owner, who played them very little. Note the frets have no playing wear, as seen in the close-up. Forgive the camera reflections. The guitar's back is just as clean as the front. This Standard model features the special design Seymour Duncan / Joe Bonamassa signed, Humbucking pickups as seen in the next to last pictured close-up. The guitar is fully original, plays smooth as butter, and sounds fabulous. It weighs 8 pounds 10.4 ounces, and comes in its original form-fit black Gibson issued hardshell case with the white plush lining. The manufacture's Gibson brochure, owners manual and other case candy is also included in the case pocket.
