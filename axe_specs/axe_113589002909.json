{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "UP FOR BIDS: One USED Epiphone Viola Bass with Epiphone hard shell case. Case is in VGC with just a few light marks and scratches...but the latches work great and the inside is mint. The bass is in very good condition with no dents or deep scratches...just faint polishing \"swirl\" scratches. The chrome on the pickups, bridge and tuners are starting to tarnish some and should buff out with some elbow grease. The fretboard is in pristine shape. It has a 30.5\" scale length, a pair of mini humbuckers and features an adjustable trapeze bridge. New D'Addario Chromes Flat Wound strings have been installed. The previous owner lightly buffed/sanded the back of the neck for a faster feel. He also moved the top strap button from the back of the bass body, to the top of the neck. Then he moved it onto the back of the neck, where it now sits. This resulted in many fine scratches around the holes, which he filled with some colored putty. He should've left it alone, but it is what it is. I posted two pictures of the moved strap button and the filled holes. You obviously can't notice it while playing and it doesn't detract too much from the beautiful finish on the back of this bass. Bass is a player, not a case queen; it plays and sounds great, with a nice smooth action. I'll be selling many guitars and basses in the future, so keep a lookout. I've been diagnosed with CMT disease and I'm losing my strength in both hands. **********I DO NOT END AUCTIONS EARLY, SO PLEASE DON'T ASK!********** IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ BEFORE PLACING A BID!
