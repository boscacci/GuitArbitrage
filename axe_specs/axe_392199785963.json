{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 1977 Fender Stratocaster, serial number S786211, in excellent condition. The original blond finish is translucent, and you can see the ash grained body through the finish. It shows light normal playing wear, especially considering the guitar is over 40 years old. There's a small area of the back edge contour where the finish is worn smoothly down to the wood, and three more little worn areas on the back edge near the strap button, as seen in the close-ups. All the hardware is fully original. The underside of the pickguard has a sticker with the serial number for the body that matches the headstock's serial number. Note that the pickups and wiring harness are also original. The underside of the pickups are stamped 774918, and the original brown masking tape is still intact holding the pickup lead wires together. The original pot codes read 1377648 as seen in the last picture, which translates to CTS Manufactured, the 48th week of 1976. The tip of the original tremolo arm broke off inside the bridge block many years ago, and the tremolo arm itself is missing. Since I don't use the tremolo when I play blues and Classic Rock, this never bothered me, since many players like Clapton block off the tremolo anyway. But eventually someone might want to drill out the small piece of threaded metal that's lodged inside the tremolo-bridge block, if they want to install a tremolo arm. The neck is straight, the original frets show only light playing wear, and the guitar plays and sounds great. The 6th string height at the 12th fret is 1/16-inch. The bridge pickup measures 4.5 K ohms, the middle pickup reads 4.4 K ohms, and the neck pickup is 4.2 K ohms. These original pickups are very well balanced from the factory. The guitar weighs 10 pounds, 2.6 ounces, and comes in its original Fender hard-shell case with red plush lining, and has the raised Fender logo on the outside of the case lid. We offer a 48-hour approval period with a full money-back guarantee, except shipping costs, so purchase with confidence. Choose our asking price of $1995 and we pay all shipping and insurance costs in the continental U.S., and half the mailing costs overseas. Otherwise, domestic shipping for this value guitar fully-insured would be $99 (shipping out to the West Coast costs $119), and overseas shipping will be $159. Buyers from Australia must pay $495 for Fed-Ex shipping, since we have to pack this in a full size guitar box. The Post Office won't mail this size package to Australia or New Zealand through normal package postage rates. However, we can ship this guitar with its guitar neck unbolted from the body, and folded in to a padded gig bag to reduce the length of the box, and ship via USPS Priority mail package rate for $149 to Australia. We then must keep the hardshell case.", "ItemID": "392199785963", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T01:16:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T06:44:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ORIGINAL-1977-FENDER-STRATOCASTER-BLONDE-FINISH-ASH-BODY-EXCELLENT-CONDITION-/392199785963", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Harrison, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3921997859638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SwEAAOSw3T5cEpK8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/itEAAOSwtcRcEpKu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/itkAAOSwtcRcEpK0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2gMAAOSwxFVcEpLG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g-gAAOSwXitcEpK4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/izgAAOSwwS5cEpK~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FDsAAOSwy3JcEpLD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Z18AAOSwgbdcEpLL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/93sAAOSwwPdcEpLP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/V5UAAOSwgnJcEpKg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vUYAAOSwcf9cEpKl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6zkAAOSws0pcEpKp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "72601", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "teacher7021", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1386, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1795.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1795.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 227}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "Europe", "CA", "JP", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ORIGINAL 1977 FENDER STRATOCASTER, BLONDE FINISH, ASH BODY.
