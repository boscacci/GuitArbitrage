{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson ES335 2000 dot reissue, great condition hide this posting A classic reissue by Gibson in great shape. The Bigsby was added by my trusted luthier in Tucson with Tone Pros TP6R-N Nashville Tunematic Bridge, Roller Saddle. The pickup controls have been rewired to give individual volume control to the two humbucker pickups. The neck is smooth and plays extremely well. The frets are not worn. Grover tuners. Finish is nearly perfect. Strap locks included. Nice hardshell case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Gibson ES-335 Dot has been known by more than one name over the last three decades, but it's undoubtedly singular in its popularity as one of Gibson's most well-known reissues. First known as the ES-335 Dot, then renamed the ES-335 Reissue in the '90s, this instrument is based on the technical specs of its 1960s predecessor. While specimens from the early '80s may command a higher asking price, all ES-335 Reissues are built from a semi-hollow maple body with a rosewood fingerboard, two humbuckers, and come with the identifying dot inlays. Its popularity over the years has landed the ES-335 Dot Reissue in the hands of many a famous guitarist, like Dave Grohl and Eric Clapton.", "ItemID": "264011109836", "EndTime": "2018-11-04T21:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-28T21:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-ES-335-Dot-Figured-Antique-Natural-2000-Semi-Acoustic-Hard-Case-/264011109836", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Green Valley, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640111098368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0N1g2MDA=/z/vwEAAOSw7Spb1dzg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NFg2MDA=/z/MW0AAOSw1Sdb1d6H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-B4AAOSwKL1b1d0O/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/q2AAAOSwgA1b1d09/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/zDMAAOSwpsBb1d1D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/xrgAAOSwULVb1d1M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDYwMA==/z/pMIAAOSwX0db1d1k/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pm4AAOSwdrpb1dzT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "85622", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "swinglow21", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 339, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1576.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1576.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1034}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson ES-335 Dot Figured Antique Natural 2000 Semi Acoustic With Hard Case.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Beige"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 470, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1601.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
