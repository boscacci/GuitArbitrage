{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Carvin V220 was made in the USA, probably in 1986 or 1987 from the \u201cCarvin Museum\u201d web site. It has been modified; mainly the body was re-painted a satin black with a bright yellow interior on the body. The new body finish job was not professionally -done, the matte black with yellow borders with a masking tape joint and the surface with minor imperfections, but looks very good from a distance and would be striking on stage. There is a clear matte/gloss border just above the body/neck joint (see photo). The neck and headstock appear to have the original gloss black finish, the neck is arrow-straight, and there is no evidence of any damage to the guitar. The fretboard is ebony and has a small chip at the nut joint near the low E string, but it does not affect the playing at all. The oversized frets have a bit of wear but a lot of life left. Overall, the cosmetic condition is, considering the paint job, very good for a 30-year old used instrument. The guitar has neck-thru construction and a 3x3 \u201cflying V\u201d headstock configuration. The 1980s \u201cCarvin\u201d headstock insignia was removed at some point by a previous owner. The tuners are stamped \u201cCarvin\u201d in the 1980s font but are probably not original to the guitar since there are holes indicating that another set was previously installed (I noticed Schaller tuners on other 1980s V220s). The truss rod plate is in the same \u201cbullet\u201d shape as Carvin, but is stamped \u201cThe Strange\u201d. The bridge is a USA Kahler fixed floating hard tail that is probably original to the guitar and, according to the Kahler web site, required no body routing. The back plate is \u201chazed\u201d (see photo) and has some non-original screws. The chrome knobs are newer replacements; the guitar likely left the factory with blacktone metal knobs. The pickups are C22N (neck) and M22SB (bridge) and the main controls are VT (the original VVT scheme changed by a previous owner who rewired so that the third pot is not connected) with a 3-way pickup on-off switch. Both pickups are also wired to coil splitting switches. Everything works great as intended given the modifications, and the rewiring job was solid. Thus, the guitar is a player, not a collector. It plays like a high-end Carvin both unplugged and amplified. The original Carvin hard shell case is scuffed and bruised but in structurally sound working condition, and all the hinges, hasps and bales function properly. The guitar and case are together very heavy, hence the relatively high shipping cost. If shipping is less than $55, I will refund the difference. A full refund will be provided with no questions asked. I will return 100% of bid price + 50% of return shipping after the guitar is returned. Yes, this means the buyer takes a small risk (50% of return shipping) when bidding on this guitar. No partial refunds.", "ItemID": "323661643284", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T03:30:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-23T03:30:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Carvin-V220-/323661643284", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bridgeton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236616432848080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzMlgxNjAw/z/0pUAAOSwkDtcR1W-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTM3/z/XTwAAOSwlfNcR1XL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEwM1gxNjAw/z/5GcAAOSwvpVcR1XW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2MlgxNjAw/z/FYYAAOSw-V1cR1Xi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xW4AAOSwc6ZcR1Xw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFgxNjAw/z/PsIAAOSwAopcR1X-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFgxNjAw/z/2woAAOSw~HFcR1YK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMlgxNjAw/z/X4QAAOSwbZ5cR1Ye/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2OVgxNjAw/z/XpwAAOSwEVlcR1Y2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4E4AAOSwSVNcR1ZE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwOVgxNjAw/z/fuUAAOSwdrdcR1ZQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08302", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "orton0231", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1141, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Carvin V220", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Carvin"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["V220"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Yellow/black"]}]}, "HitCount": 442, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 410.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
