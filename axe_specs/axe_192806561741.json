{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here we have a rare, first year 1982 Made in USA Epiphone Spirit Double Cutaway Slab Body Electric Guitar The example listed here was made at the original Gibson plant in Kalamazoo, MI., has the original and very desirable Tim Shaw double cream humbucker pickups with 8.18 k ohms at the neck, and 8.60 k ohms at the bridge. Measurements were taken using a professional multimeter and a patch cord connected to the guitar's output jack. Solder joints are original. The neck and rosewood fingerboard feel very similar to the Heritage Flying Vs of the same period. Not a slim taper, but not as clubby as a 59. This one has a very beautiful, slightly figured, sunburst finish, bound maple top, with the whole guitar having very few imperfections as the pictures demonstrate. No cracks or through the finish dings or dents. Includes original hardshell case. The following information is from the guitar-list.com website: Brand name: EPIPHONE Series name: Epiphone American SeriesDates of manufacture: 1982 to 1983 The Epiphone Spirit, made from 1982-1983, was one of the last guitars built by Gibson at their Kalamazoo Factory. The Epiphone Spirit is like a Gibson Les Paul Junior double cutaway with a few minor differences like modern pickups, and cutaways at the 20th fret rather than the 22nd. Various motives have been proposed for the introduction of the Epiphone Spirit - some say that it was an attempt to find work for the workers at the Kalamazoo plant, others that it was in response to cheaper Japanese Gibson copies. The Epiphone Spirit came in 1 and 2 pickup versions called the Spirit I and II respectively and both had Gibson \"Tim Shaw\" 1959 PAF reissue pickups. The Spirit II had an extra volume control and a three way selector switch on account of its additional pickup. The Spirit I has a black Les Paul Junior style pickguard - which is absent from the Spirit II. The Spirits had double cutaway poplar bodies and 3 piece set maple necks. Some of the models have bound figure maple tops. The Epiphone USA logo is silk screened onto the headstock in gold. The truss rod cover is engraved \"Spirit\". From 1983 this model became the Gibson Spirit and subsequent models were produced as Gibsons in the Nashville plant. ..............................................................................................................................................
