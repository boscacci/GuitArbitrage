{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "It's an old Magnum Les Paul-copy electric guitar. It's probably from the 1990s or 2000s, I'd guess. It has been partially cannibalized for parts and partly put back together with other parts. None of it by me! Here's the diagnosis, starting at the headstock. It has been upgraded with Grover tuners, but they are six-in-line tuners so the first three are on upside down. The sixth E-string tuner seems to be broken. The nut is missing. The truss rod works, and the proper truss rod wrench is included. The frets and fretboard are in good, but not perfect, shape. The neck seems to be appropriately straight and in good shape. The bridge humbucker pickup is missing. The upper bout treble side switch is missing. The bridge is missing. The tailpiece is missing, but the studs are in place. The adjustable bridge that is on it does not fit correctly. The stop tailpiece is missing, but the studs are in place. The little bolt and nut for the pickguard is missing. It does have some ordinary wear and tear, there and there, particularly on the back lower bout edge, but looks okay. The top is arched, as if carved, not flat. It comes in a non-original, but working, padded gig bag. Anybody up for the challenge of bringing it back to life or just want to use it for parts? If you do make an offer during business hours, please know that I typically respond to offers within the hour. Questions? It will be well packed with plenty of new 1/2\" bubble wrap and shipped in a new 46\"x19\"x7\" stout cardboard instrument box.
