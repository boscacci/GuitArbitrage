{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Killer Vibe. Classic Sound. Gibson designed the Les Paul Classic Player Plus specifically for players looking for a dependable instrument that can handle a grueling gig schedule while retaining vintage Gibson mojo. To no ones surprise, they absolutely nailed it! The satin finish is understated, simple, and elegant, and it looks great with the white binding and the AA maple top! Ever the forward thinkers, the design team at Gibson equipped these guitars with Richlite fingerboard, which feels and sounds similar to ebony but requires very little maintenance. This rough-and-ready fingerboard is home to 22 incredibly durable cryogenically-treated frets that make precise intonation a breeze. Add in a comfy rounded neck profile with classy rolled white binding, and youve got one heck of a great-feeling neck! Oh, and the two P-90 pickups can scream when you play hard through an overdriven amp and sing sweetly when you play clean. All in all, this is a players guitar with collector-grade looks and feel, and we could not be happier to showcase it for our exceptional customers. Condition of Instrument This Classic Player is in excellent condition with minimal signs of use. Includes the original hardshell case.
