{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar served me well for a long time. Great Metal/Hard Rock sound from the bridge pickup, Neck pickup turns instantly into that round, tubey soloing sound you want with the ESP pickups. I've been collecting the last couple years and have gotten into skinnier necks and haven't picked this up in a while. Jeff, Zakk like a bit thicker neck which is great for a clutch style grip and bends. Guitar is in great condition, has 2 nicks in the paint (shown) that are not visible from the front, a little nail polish would sort it right out but I'm not going to do it just in case you like it (reliced?) Guitar has a fantastic Kahler Tremelo which stays in tune. ESP tuners are very fine and sturdy. Guitar is due for a string change, I'll include 9's or 10's if you'd like with the purchase, just e-mail me your preference. (I don't like changing strings). This guitar is cross posted, but I promise it won't disappear in the last hour of bidding. I just want to see someone love it like I did and play it regularly. Starting the bidding at $1 If you'd like a video or to hear it play, send me a message and I'll make one.

E-bay keeps adding it's own description in the middle of the listing that is not accurate. I've put the proper specs in all areas that are editable.
