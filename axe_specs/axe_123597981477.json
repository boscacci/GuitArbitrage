{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Excellent Condition! Taylor 324ce-K All Koa Fall Limited Acoustic/Electric Guitar.This was a limited edition guitar and has seen home studio use only. Sounds & plays beautifully. A little about the electronics & finish...ES 2 electronics: incredibly natural sound with full dynamicsTraditionally, acoustic-electric guitars have employed piezo transducers under their bridge saddles. But Taylor's Expression System 2 is different. It uses a proprietary pickup behind the saddle. The pickup features three individually calibrated, precisely positioned piezo-electric sensors that respond organically to the instrument's acoustic energy as it's transferred through the saddle. In concert with Taylor's custom-designed, studio-grade preamp, the result is a natural acoustic sound with incredible dynamic range and responsiveness to your pick or finger attack. Sweetwater's guitar gurus are mightily impressed with Taylor's Expression System 2 electronics, and we think you will be, too!Taylor's durable satin finish will age beautifullyThe satin finish used on the 324ce-K FLTD was developed at Taylor for maximum durability and resistance to cold-checking. The unique formula allows a thinner coverage to be applied, which lets the wood resonate more freely, ultimately giving you fuller tone. It's clearer than lacquer and won't yellow over time the way lacquer does. Plus, this ultraviolet-cured finish is also more environmentally friendly than traditional lacquer finishes.Can't find any flaws on the guitar at all. Well taken care of, adult owned. Even the case is mint!", "ItemID": "123597981477", "EndTime": "2019-01-18T02:11:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T19:28:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Taylor-324ce-K-FLTD-Fall-Limted-All-Koa-Acoustic-Electric-Guitar-/123597981477", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lubbock, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235979814778080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/~WoAAOSwyBRcP4V5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/ptYAAOSwptZcP4V~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/vTYAAOSwcDdcP4WD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/kAQAAOSwS2lcP4WF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/NqUAAOSwlThcP4WK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/08IAAOSwpTBcP4WO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/hrgAAOSwEp5cP4WS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/LpoAAOSwWUBcP4WW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/zLgAAOSw~VBcP4Wa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY0WDEyOTY=/z/VWAAAOSw1llcP4Wd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "79410", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sizzlefrax1973", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 740, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 102}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Taylor 324ce-K FLTD Fall Limted All Koa Acoustic Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["324ce-K"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Taylor"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 36, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1063111001", "StoreName": "Sizzlefrax"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
