{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "American Standard Strat from the mid-80s (E4+ serial number) in worn but great working condition. This guitar was purchased used from the famous Elderly Instruments (Lansing, MI) in 1996. I've owned it ever since. In my younger years, I played in bands, as well as in the pit for a couple of musicals, but stopped playing in college. The guitar has been sitting in my parents' house ever since. Comes with hard case, which has some markings on the outside but is perfectly functional. Sad to let this guitar go as it holds great memories, but it deserves to be played.
