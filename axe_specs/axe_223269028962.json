{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a very clean, versatile and great sounding and playing guitar. The guitar is from a smoke free home and has never been gigged. I am selling only to downsize and this guitar deserves to be played frequently. The guitar is a Xaviere xv2144 neck thru guitar in purple. The body top is a curly maple and looks classy. The grain on the back and neck are also really nice looking. The neck is straight and the action is low so this thing plays very easily. The back cover is not original. There is a small burr mark right above the humbucker. It isn\u2019t too noticeable but wanted to call it out. The pickups are upgraded and they are: Bridge: new GFS Crunchy PAT Middle: Fender USA 57 RI 016730 Neck: Fender USA Highway 1 You can check out more info on Xaviere and GFS at guitarfetish.com. The GFS compliments the fender single coils nicely. The PAT isn\u2019t over aggressive and has a great tonal mixture with mid level crunch and moderate body. Backing off the tone provides a thicker warm grunge rock sound The fender pickups are both American and have the great bell like melodic ness and crisp brightness. You will not be disappointed in how it sounds, plays and wide tone arranges. Shipping is free in the 48 US only. Be mindful on the price as it runs me 20-35 dollars to ship guitars with USPS. Please ask any questions that you may have.", "ItemID": "223269028962", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T11:58:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T16:44:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Xaviere-XV2144-neck-thru-guitar-/223269028962", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pennsville, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232690289628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ASQAAOSwWH1cBVim/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RN8AAOSwxZxcBVh-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ko4AAOSwuQhcBVhz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2jsAAOSwVEFcBViP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xkYAAOSwdzhcBViY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QTsAAOSwWW5cBVie/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OKEAAOSwlLlcBViI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r2YAAOSw8iZcBViu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08070", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wormlegs", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1411, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 175}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Xaviere XV2144 neck thru guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Xaviere"]}]}, "HitCount": 265, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
