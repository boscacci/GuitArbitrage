{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is my Greco 1978 EG600 Les Paul Custom (Peter Frampton) style guitar. This is a great example of the lawsuit guitars of that era. Gibson went down hill for awhile in the 70's and the Japanese were making them like Gibson used to. This guitar is all original except for the tuners, they were replaced with new Gibson Grover tuners. A Gibson truss rod cover and gold speed knobs were added. The original tuners and truss rod cover will be included. The guitar did not have a pickguard when I purchased it. There are a few dings and scratches but overall this guitar is in great condition for being 40 years old! It has that great open book headstock design like the Gibson models, and great binding around the guitar which is starting to age in some places. This is a great chance to get a great guitar without spending thousands of dollars like the Gibson's from the 70's. THIS GUITAR IS HERE IN THE USA, so it won't ship from Japan. Don't miss out on this great instrument. Hard shell case included. The guitar will ship from Manhattan, KS. Ships to lower 48 only!!", "ItemID": "163419851422", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T14:19:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T20:57:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Greco-EG600-CUSTOM-Les-Paul-type-3-pickup-Electric-Guitar-/163419851422", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Soulsbyville, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634198514228080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/EWkAAOSwgotcCtYv/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/pdMAAOSwI01cCtYg/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/jx8AAOSwUalcCtZE/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/p4MAAOSwBPRcCtZU/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/8igAAOSwVH9cCtZj/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/bAgAAOSwRWZcJ0KS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/fOYAAOSwvpVcJ0K4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/41AAAOSwWk5cJ0Lo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95372", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "april8160", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 226, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 56}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Greco EG600 CUSTOM Les Paul type 3 pickup Electric Guitar\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Greco"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["EG600 CUSTOM"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 836, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
