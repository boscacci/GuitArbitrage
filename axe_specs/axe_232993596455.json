{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a Used Ibanez Steve Vai JEMV7WH electric guitar in excellent condition. This guitar was purchased in the mid to late 2000s. I am not sure exactly when. This was a backup that was rarely played. The gold hardware is in great condition and I don't really see any scratches or marks. I just plugged it in and everything was normal and the guitar sounded very good. The strings have not been changed for years and may actually still be the original strings so please factor that into your decision. Please feel free to ask any questions and I am happy to answer them the best I can or take more photos for you. The case is the original case. I had problems with the combination lock from the beginning. I never set the combination but at 000 it always was difficult to open. I finally just pried it so that it wouldn't have issue anymore so the middle locking latch is not functional. I will ship this Fed Ex and will require a signature. I only ship to the lower 48 states in the USA. Please factor in the shipping cost to the amount you want to bid. If you have any questions about the shipping cost please contact me and I will gladly let you know the cost to your location. The box I will ship the guitar in is 47x20x7 and will weigh 30lbs. If you received the guitar and you don't like it then I will accept returns as long as the guitar is in the same condition as I sent it to you and it is agreed upon within 7 days of you receiving the guitar. The buyer would have to pay for the return shipping cost however. Please feel free to ask any questions as I want you to be happy with your purchase.", "ItemID": "232993596455", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T23:17:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T23:17:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-Ibanez-Steve-Vai-Model-JEMV7WH-Electric-Guitar-Excellent-Condition-/232993596455", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2329935964558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/ufIAAOSwDP1b1ej5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/XxYAAOSwtItb1ekC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/94wAAOSwTwBb1ekK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/EUUAAOSw18Jb1elN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/IAwAAOSwkXFb1elW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/DI4AAOSwts9b1el4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/PvoAAOSwf4hb1emA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY1/z/dZEAAOSwHWtb1emP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY1/z/NDUAAOSw5Xpb1eoB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY1/z/~DYAAOSwVFJb1eoL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/YfsAAOSwC8Zb1eoZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/dgAAAOSwz5Nb1eol/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53213", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jimbogolfer2002", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 370, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 10}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Used Ibanez Steve Vai Model JEMV7WH Electric Guitar Excellent Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JEM7VWH"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["JEM7VWH"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 143, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
