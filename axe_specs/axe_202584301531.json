{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This beautiful guitar was stepped on backstage at a LA concert when it was less than 2 years old. As best as I can tell it is one of the last made in Japan. Since these guitars have a large block running through their middle, I thought it best to reassemble all the parts I had available instead of replacing the top. With everything loose the action and pickup mounts were still perfect. I did have to replicate the pick guard from a piece of tortoise shell I had carefully stored in my shop. The finish is all original, cracks, warts and all. I love to play it, but with my health going south, it has become too heavy for me. Includes the original warranty notice and polishing cloth.", "ItemID": "202584301531", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T18:00:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T21:17:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/DAngelico-New-Yorker-archtop-electric-guitar-repairs-Plays-great-/202584301531", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Leesville, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025843015318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/95sAAOSwVIBcHZAX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ih8AAOSwjBhcHZAo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U8sAAOSwIAJcHZBB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WlIAAOSwsZhcHZBS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ax0AAOSwsO5cHZBc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r5gAAOSws2RcHZBz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0g8AAOSw7HhcHZCE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-IQAAOSwQ9lcHZCo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/a7EAAOSwhzhcHZDO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DUcAAOSwHSdcHZD0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zOwAAOSwGBRcHZEP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/raMAAOSwiT1cHZEf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "29070", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "2fingerchords", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 510, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 380}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "D'Angelico New Yorker archtop electric guitar with repairs.
