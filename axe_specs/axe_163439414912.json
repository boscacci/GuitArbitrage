This is a recap of our personal story and the history of how we grew our company brand to six thriving pawn stores in the Dallas Metro Area.As the owners, Dan and Kim Foster, we began planning our first pawn shop in early 1987. Trying to establish a name for the company was no easy task. Dan felt that if someone needed to borrow money you would first seek out a relative and Uncle Dan\u2019s Pawn was founded.Later that year, we opened our first store in a Cedar Hill shopping center at Beltline and Highway 67. After several years in that Cedar Hill location, we outgrew our space and needed a larger building. We purchased 1.67 acres behind our existing store on N. Clark Rd. Construction began immediately on our new 7,500 sq. ft. site. After six months, we moved into our beautiful new building. Our Cedar Hill store has been in this location since 1992. The company began to make loans on large items like cars, boats, buses, trailers and 18-wheelers. Once we were asked to make a loan on a helicopter, but we did not know anyone that could test it!In 1994, we purchased a former gas station on the corner of South Hampton & Wheatland Rd. Using our Cedar Hill store as the prototype, we quickly started construction. By January 1995, Uncle Dan\u2019s Pawn \u2013 South Dallas was in operation. This large, modern building just off of I-20 is easily identified by our tall neon sign and is considered our flagship location.
