Domestic Shipping Only We will ship this item only within the United States and its territories. Any items marked \"free shipping\" being shipped to Alaska or Hawaii will accrue an extra surcharge depending on the weight and dimensions of the package.

Please refrain from using a Freight Forwarding company as we will cancel any order with a shipping address to one of these companies.

Returns And Refunds We think that basically good people in an honest and open environment, who treat each other as they would like to be treated, can work out returns and refunds.\u00a0 We've structured our return policy to be fair all around.\u00a0 If we make an error, then we will make it good if you let us know about it quickly. Inspection Period In order to be eligible for any refund, we must hear from you within fourteen days of the date of delivery of the merchandise. Our Refund Offer If the item differs substantially from how we described it, then we will offer you either a full refund (you send the item back) and/or a partial refund (you keep the item).

If the item was damaged during shipment, we will offer a full refund.\u00a0 It may or may not be necessary to return the item to us, depending upon the extent of damage and insurance requirements of the carrier.

Time Line We will complete the refund within thirty days from first hearing of the problem.\u00a0 This allows for a few days of emailing, time for the item to be returned to us if necessary, and time for us to get the check mailed. Shipping And Handling Since we cannot personally hand items to our on-line customers, we must rely on a shipper to deliver them. We want one that is fast and reliable and that can provide as much information as possible about the delivery. We and our customer must be able to track the shipment. The shipment must be insured against loss and/or damage. The item must be packaged so that it can survive bumps during the journey. And we must know when our customer received it (a signature will be required for items with a winning bid of or more than $250.00). Most of our auctions use dynamic shipping. Some use flat-rate shipping. Flat-rate shipping and handling fees will be specified in the auction description. For auctions that us dynamic shipping, a link to a shipping calculator will be included within the auction description so that potential buyers can determine what shipping and handling will be.\u00a0 The final amount is calculated when the buyer checks out and usually does not differ from estimated amounts by more than a few cents.\u00a0 Freight, insurance and handling are all included in the amount show by the shipping calculator. We use UPS ground for shipments within the United States--including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, but these 3 will accrue an additional charge when the auction is marked as \"free shipping\". For customs, the declared value of a shipment will be the amount of the winning bid. Because we use UPS, we cannot ship to post office boxes (except for shipments to FPO and APO boxes and to U.S. territories where UPS ground is not offered). The item description will contain the shipping details. We must receive payment in full for the item before we will ship it. Once we receive payment, we ship items in the most prompt manner possible. At First National pawn, your complete satisfaction is our goal, and we will do everything possible to ensure that your purchase arrives quickly and undamaged.", "ItemID": "113364017707", "EndTime": "2018-11-15T23:41:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-10T23:41:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-American-Standard-Telecaster-1998-Electic-Guitar-/113364017707", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Shelby, Montana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover", "AmEx"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1133640177078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xoQAAOSwlINbtpF4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "59474", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fnp_outlet", "FeedbackRatingStar": "YellowShooting", "FeedbackScore": 20229, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.2, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": ".***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 6}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender American Standard Telecaster 1998 Electic Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1998"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["American Standard Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 463, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=7616972", "StoreName": "FNP Outlet"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 760.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
