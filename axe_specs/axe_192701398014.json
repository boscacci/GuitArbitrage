{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction today an Edwards E-LP 130 ALS, a Japanese made Les Paul copy. The ALS stands for All Lacquer Series, meaning not the hard poly spray but a breathable lacquer finish just like the original Les Pauls. The color is called Honey Burst. But it looks closer to a tobacco burst to me. The neck profile is fantastic in my opinion. Not too chunky and but not thin at all. Mahogany body with a carved maple top with a flame maple wood veneer over that. I am also pretty sure that the mahogany back is a single piece. Take a close look at the pictures and see if you can find a second piece join anywhere. Myself and others cannot. And what you have heard about these guitars is true. They sound better, play better and are built better than the actual Gibson Les Paul\u2018s that are currently being offered. This guitar has had one owner- me. I bought it, new, from a dealer in Japan in 2015 and had it shipped to me. I love it but I have two other Edwards that I play more and this one was being neglected. Technically it is used but it is in near pristine condition. There are a couple surface dings that you can see in the pictures. A word about Edwards guitars. Edwards is a sub-brand of ESP guitars. ESP guitars are crafted in Japan and are known for their fantastic quality. Their Edwards division is no exception. Rumors fly around the Internet that these are actually made in China and from what I have gathered from research they are not made in China, although the body and the neck are rough cut in a Chinese factory and then shipped to Japan to be crafted into the quality instrument that they are. I\u2019ve also have read that under Japanese law if the guitar was mostly made in China it would not be allowed to be labeled made in Japan. The following video from Cameron Cooper\u2019s YouTube channel explains some of this (about halfway through) better than I could. By the way, the guitar Cameron is playing in the video is NOT this Edwards Les Paul that is for sale. It is his E-LP 125 which is a actually a step down from this one but a great guitar, nonetheless. https://youtu.be/dtV-SvqxF6A The guitar will ship with its Deluxe ESP gig bag and be well packed and double boxed for the journey. _____________________ Specifications BODY: (Top) Flame Maple (Back) Mahogany w/Ivory Binding NECK: Mahogany FINGERBOARD: Rosewood, 22frets w/ Ivory Binding RADIUS : 305R SCALE 24.75\u201d NUT Bone (1.69\u201d) INLAY Pearloid Dish JOINT Set-neck TUNERS GOTOH BRIDGE GOTOH Old style Tune-o-matic PICKUPS (Neck) Seymour Duncan SH-55n (Bridge) Seymour Duncan SH-55b PARTS CTS control pots, switch craft output jack CONTROLS Neck Volume&Tone, Bridge Volume&Tone, Toggle PU Selector WEIGHT 7 lbs 5.4 oz ________ *A small note - some of you with a sharp eye will have noticed that guitar was strung with only five strings in the photos. That was because I had it tuned to an open G (I was playing some Rolling Stones songs with it and Keith is right, three D strings is one too many). Rest assured that the guitar will ship with six strings and be in standard tuning. *Update- I just went to the Edwards/ESP webpage for this guitar and they now mark this model as discontinued. I\u2019m kind of surprised. https://espguitars.co.jp/edwards/lp/E-LP-130ALS.html", "ItemID": "192701398014", "EndTime": "2018-11-05T16:15:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-26T16:15:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EDWARDS-E-LP-130-ALS-Guitar-Honey-Burst-/192701398014", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927013980148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDM2/z/74IAAOSwG9FbyO11/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/fGMAAOSwWnFbyO2M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/GL8AAOSwtBZbyO26/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aFsAAOSw0odbyO3o/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZrMAAOSw2yVbyO3x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/8HsAAOSwG9FbyO36/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1o4AAOSwzINbyO5c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/D6EAAOSwSVdbyO4Z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/-TQAAOSwRE9byO6X/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/DSkAAOSwctJbyO6u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/qrQAAOSwJjNbyO7K/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60625", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gn2595", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 341, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 595.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 595.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 486}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EDWARDS E-LP-130 ALS Guitar - Honey Burst\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Edwards"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["E-LP 130 ALS"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["E-LP-130ALS Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Honey Burst"]}]}, "HitCount": 342, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 605.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
