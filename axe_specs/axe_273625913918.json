{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a vintage custom built guitar, made in 1994 in the USA. The luthier James E. Porter; named the guitar model an Eagle 1, and is considered a fine instrument. The guitar comes with paperwork and a custom made case. The Guitar has a oil finish and feels very natural in the hands. The neck is fairly thick, not as thick as some USA PRS I've held but still hefty compared to the shredder guitars I normally play. The scale length of the guitar is 25 inches from nut to bridge. I believe the neck and body are mahogany, and the fretboard is either ebony or a very dark rosewood with a vine inlay. the inlays look to be real mother of pearl. I don't know how to access the truss rod, but it's location looks to be where the pick shaped decoration is. The bridge pickup is a Duncan JB; I didn't bother to look at the neck pickup but I'm guessing its a 59 seeing how that is a popular pair up. The pickups are controlled bay a main 3 way switch, but also have a individual mini 3 way toggle switches for each pickup. I believe these switches control the output of the pickups to give more of an acoustic sound when playing clean. It was hard to tell the difference what the mini toggles do on a gain channel, but on clean with both pickups on you can dial in some good tones. The only buzz I heard on the guitar was on the 6 string \" BASS E\" near the nut. I believe the guitar was set up to use a light Gauge and that is what is causing the buzz.
