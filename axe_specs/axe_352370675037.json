Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my opening statement. I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Hardluck Kings Wild Bill electric guitar in a Gloss Neon Green Finish. I traded out the stock pickups for some Black/White Zebra 4 wire pickups so I could a push/pull tone control for coil splitting. I also upgraded the tone capacitor with a nice Orange Drop style .022uf epoxy film cap. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound very good on this guitar. A very sexy looking guitar. Action is good and guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. Comes with a somewhat used purple Ritter gigbag. The gigbag is somewhat torn up on the inside at the headstock,and it has a few tears to the mesh part on the front. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is.
