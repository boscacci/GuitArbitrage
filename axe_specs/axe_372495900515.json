{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1997 Fender American Standard StratocasterHere is a genuine American made Fender Stratocaster. The serial number starts with \"N7\" which dates it to 1997. It features the Inca Silver finish which as aged to kind of light gold color, but still looks silver depending on the lighting. Actual weight is 8 lbs 3 oz.The body is in good condition overall with a small ding on the top and some scratches and small dings around the edges. There is one hairline finish crack next to the neck joint, but it's not into the wood and is a common issue on Strats from this era. The only major issue is that someone put a small hole next to the bridge for some reason. It's not very noticeable and no one will see it when you're rockin' out on stage! The neck is straight and the frets show average wear. It's in very good playing condition with no dead frets or other major issues. The fretboard is clean and back of the neck has a few small impressions, but no major dings or worn areas. The headstock has a lot of wear around the top edge, but no cracks, repairs or extra holes.The hardware and electronics are original and in excellent working condition. Someone changed out the pickgaurd at one point, so there is an extra set of holes, but everything is covered up by the current pickguard. I checked out all of the pickups, pots and wiring and it's all original. It comes in a TKL hardshell case which has some general wear on the outside. All of the latches, hinges and handle are in working order and the interior has no bad odors.This guitar is listed on Reverb also. In the event that it sells on both marketplaces, I will honor the first sale and refund the second. There will be no exceptions to this!Please note that I do not set up my guitars before mailing. I have played it and everything is great as far as I'm concerned, but you may need to change the strings, adjust the action or do other maintenece to get it to your preferences.
