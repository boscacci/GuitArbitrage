{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am trying once again to thin out my herd of stringed instruments. It\u2019s getting harder and harder since I am attached to all of them and have done custom work and mods on just about everything left in my collection. This auction is for a rare Jay Turser Cutlass 6 string electric. There are a ton of features on this axe, all standard equipment and build\u2026this was one of the premier guitars out of the early Chinese factory. Lets start with the body; this is a set neck solid body guitar. I can\u2019t find a seam in the back so I think the body is one piece. The top looks like about a AA to AAA bookmatched quilted maple stained a nice mahog color\u2026a beautiful finish. The body binding is abalone and faux ivory. The neck and headstock are also bound. The hardware is all gold and in very good shape for it\u2019s age as I have never gigged this guitar and it has always lived in a gig bag. Unlike most Tursers, this guitar came stock with aftermarket pickups, these are Artec toaster humbuckers. They have a vintage vibe but overdrive well when needed. This guitar is used but shows and plays as new with undistinguishable fret wear, clean gold hardware and just minor swirls from being wiped down. I\u2019m starting this auction at $200 as this is one of the best examples of an early Turser that you will find available\u2026it shows as well as it plays and sounds. The only change I made to this guitar (besides setting it up) was to swap out the plastic knobs for wooden bell shaped knobs from Guitar Fetish. ($13.95) Included is a gig bag, in which the guitar will be shipped, then boxed wrapped up in bubble wrap.I ship FexEx, I take a bit of a hit on the shipping but I like the tracking and reliability. Check out my other auctions, I will be listing about 20 guitars and basses and microphones in the next few months. I ship fast and currently own a 100% feedback rating as a buyer and seller on EBay (860+ transactions, a member since 2001).", "ItemID": "264035574229", "EndTime": "2018-11-13T01:18:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T01:05:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jay-Turser-Cutlass-Rare-custom-electric-guitar-Chinese-factory-/264035574229", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ogden, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640355742298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/zNkAAOSwHu5b6M~F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/6oMAAOSws~pb6M~F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/HwoAAOSwHnJb6M~F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/WjgAAOSwe~lb6M~F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDYwMA==/z/458AAOSwIw1b6M~E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blindedbyreality", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 886, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1303}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jay Turser Cutlass Rare custom electric guitar Chinese factory", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jay Turser"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["toaster pickups"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 62, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 255.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
