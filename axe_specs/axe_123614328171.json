{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I am the original owner of this 2014 Gibson ES-335 in Vintage Sunburst. I have only used this guitar for writing and recording in my smoke free home studio and never gigged it. I want to be up front about the fact that there is a lacquer crack below the upper f-hole and above the bridge and bridge pickup. It should be visible in the second picture, and I am happy to provide more pictures on request. I first noticed the crack about 3 months after I bought it. Instead of having it repaired I chose to keep an eye on it to see if it would get longer or more cracks would appear, which has not happened. I personally could not tell if the crack was just to the lacquer or if the top veneer was cracked so I took it to an authorized Gibson repair center to have it inspected. They confirmed that it is not cracked through all veneer layers, and they were confident that it is likely only a crack to the lacquer not the top layer. Having said that, I think it is best to be cautious when selling a guitar like this where the only way to really know if the crack is into the top veneer is have a qualified luthier sand the lacquer down and see if the veneer is cracked and if so repair it and refinish the area. Clearly that would be a repair in the $300 - $400 range, so I am dropping the asking price down accordingly. While I don't mind the crack and do believe it is just a lacquer crack I would like to leave the decision of a potential repair/refinish up to a potential buyer. There are also some pick marks on the top horn (see picture) that are not through the lacquer and would likely buff out. I played this guitar quite a bit for the first couple of years I've owned it, but it has been in the case for the past two years. The frets do not have any divots and have never been leveled so there is plenty of life there. I have kept the fretboard conditioned with bore oil, which I tend to do every 3 - 4 months when regularly playing a guitar. I just gave this fretboard an oil treatment when changing the strings a couple weeks ago. I currently have the guitar strung with 11's. The CTS pots work perfectly with no crackling through the entire sweep and the pickups are stock '57 Classics. Everything is stock except the Dunlop strap locks that I swapped out for the standard strap buttons when I got it. I'm including the strap locks in case the buyer doesn't use Dunlop locks and doesn't want to change them out. Will ship with the original hard shell case. Please ask any additional questions you have before bidding, and I'm happy to provide additional pictures by request.
