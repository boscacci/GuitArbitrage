{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great shape 2004 Fender Telecaster American Standard with a Natural Ash Body, Maple neck, and a Bigsby B-5 Vibrato Bar with a Fender Logo installed. I will include the original bridge as per photo number 11. The guitar is in excellent shape with no dings, nicks, etc. of any kind. Minor pick scratches on the pickguard. No belt buckle marks on the back of guitar as it was only played at home with my sweats on. It never left my house and has minimal hours on it at home. Basically no fret wear on the fingerboard. Weight is approximately 9 pounds 6 ounces but probably over a pound is added with the Bigsby bar. Guitar is basically like new and in great shape. Included is the original hard shell Fender case. After further research on the Fender website, based on the serial number, this guitar was built in 2004 and was purchased by me in 2005. I am the original owner of this guitar which I purchased at Dave's Guitar Shop in LaCrosse, Wi. I do not have the original receipt.", "ItemID": "264105857144", "EndTime": "2019-01-03T18:48:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-27T18:48:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-American-Standard-2004-/264105857144", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "East Troy, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641058571448080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/SUwAAOSw-HRcJRPz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/BSQAAOSwyPFcJRPS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/XcIAAOSwXF5cJRPd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/Jh8AAOSwIS9cJRPr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/QJIAAOSwC45cJRQO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/ZJcAAOSwcXhcJRQV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/jVsAAOSwE~ZcJRQe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/F~cAAOSwxtVcJRQr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/9f8AAOSwaPpcJRQy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/5N8AAOSwk4RcJRQ7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/2GsAAOSw0~pcJRRb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/CZEAAOSwcttcJRRG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53120", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "larryandme97", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 279, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 13}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster American Standard 2004", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["2 pickups"]}]}, "HitCount": 360, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar was made in  America and stayed in America.
