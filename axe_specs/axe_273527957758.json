{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "When is the last time you have seen a Kent 1960's Violin Shape Bass ? Some blemishes as you would expect from an almost 50 Year old Instrument.Very nice condition for it's age. Frets and Fingerboard are in great shape.I don't see cracking of wood at the back of the head-stock, I think these are tiny hairline cracks of the lacquer.Very cool vintage Kent 4 String bass! 833 Model Hollow body electric bass. 30 inch short-scale neck. 1960's Japanese made bass with all sorts of vintage appointments. Sorry no case. Spruce top with maple back and sides. Really nice triple binding sides, original pickups, original volume, tone knobs (even with different colors).Great sounding bass with good action. No crack or break repairs. The neck fits nicely in the hand and makes playing this bass a thrill. Check pictures for the triple binding and sunburst back. These basses are very rare and hard to come by - especially one as original as this one! Great vintage bass with a very good sound. I added a pictures showing a bump like it hit something in the rear of the neck and reduced the price accordingly. Electronics work as they should.
