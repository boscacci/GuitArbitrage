{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Cool Red Marble Peavey USA Generation Series Electric w Hard Case : serial # 04506574 made in US: Peavey has been making some of the best bang for the buck US guitars for 40 years. The generation series are \u201ctele\u201d style with carved tops and a softer cutaway. Ours is finished in a red magma/marble? look and it is in very nice condition throughout. It has never been abused and shows only modest wear throughout ( surface scratches and minor dings ). The worst wear is to the gold hardware on the knobs and tremolo. The trem bar is still so nice I wonder if it is newer?? The neck is wonderful, straight and true with excellent frets and good play action. The active PV pickups work fine with a nice variation of tone. Just restrung her with a new set of D\u2019Adario XL 10s and ready to rock :-). Includes a generic hard case ( solid and protects well but exterior wear ) to keep it warm and happy .
