{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FENDER TELECASTER ARTIST SERIES RITCHIE KOTZEN SIGNATURE TELE.INCLUDES HEAVY DUTY ALUMINUM FLIGHT CASE AS SHOWN. PRE OWNED GUITAR IN MINT CONDITION - NO FRET WEAR. Amazing vintage Tele soundsWhen DiMarzio set out to design a neck pickup that delivers amazing vintage Tele sound, they knew they had to go beyond merely copying a 40-year-old design. Sporting controlled-tension coil winding, special wire, and hand-calibrated magnets, from ppp to fff, the Twang King delivers pick attack response like you've never experienced in a single-coil. Of course, the Twang King is wax-potted twice for squeal-free performance.Killer lead soundsWith less DC resistance than a standard Tele single-coil and twin-blade poles for less string-pull than standard rod magnets, DiMarzio's Chopper T Bridge pickup is much hotter and punchier than single-coil Tele bridge pickups - and its has way more twang and snap than a typical humbucker. The Chopper T concentrates its energy in the lows and mids for a huge sound with lots of crunch - not to mention perfect lead tones for everything from country to rock to fusion (and everything in between). And of course, being a humbucking design, there's no noise.Fender Richie Kotzen Telecaster Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:Contoured, bound ash body with flame maple topLarge C-profile maple neck/fingerboard; 12\" radius; 22 jumbo fretsDiMarzio Chopper T (bridge) and Twang King (neck) pickupsRotary series/parallel switch6-saddle string-through-body Tele bridgeGold hardware; abalone dot markersThe Fender Richie Kotzen Telecaster solidbody electric guitar flirts with perfection.
