What does this mean? In the Select Stratocaster HSS, Fender has actually inlaid a compound-radius rosewood fingerboard into the guitar's thick C-shaped neck, so the perimeter of the neck itself is the actual binding. It's a novel and innovative approach that creates a unique, stylish look, while giving you an uber-comfortable, buttery fretting-hand feel with delightfully rounded edges and no side seam between neck and fingerboard.Custom electronics for amazing Strat soundsThe Fender Select Strat HSS's two single-coil pickups and single humbucker were wound and voiced specifically for the Select series. You won't find these pickups anywhere else. They're slightly overwound, for a lively output that's rich and vibrant. They're a perfect match for getting classic Strat tones from virtually any amplifier.Premium tonewoods for a premium guitarFender held nothing back when designing the Select Stratocaster HSS. It's got a highly-figured flame maple top, highlighted by a hand-stained finish. The neck is figured maple, quartersawn for extreme strength. And the compound-radius rosewood fretboard is buffed, an extra dose of class you won't find on many guitars. While these details look amazing, they all add to the incredibly rich tone of the Fender Select Stratocaster HSS.List price new: $2,849.00 Free shipping: Continental United States Only", "ItemID": "123558877968", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T02:34:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-23T02:34:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Select-Stratocaster-HSS-Antique-Burst-/123558877968", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Suffield, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235588779688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/cBEAAOSwIvBcHu~B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/HA0AAOSwG6tcHu~O/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/dRkAAOSwmXpcHu~Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/35EAAOSw8fRcHu~n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/8oIAAOSwNUlcHu~2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/rAYAAOSw0wJcHvAB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/n1AAAOSwxPNcHvBI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/RAoAAOSwfhlcHvBx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/MAMAAOSwMKFcHvB7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/01IAAOSwwXRcHvCD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/uooAAOSw0d1cHvCL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "06078", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "livingwater2009", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 991, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1327.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1327.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***z", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 195}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Select Stratocaster HSS - Antique Burst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster HSS"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Antique burst"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Special Run"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 265, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1352.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint condition: .As close to new as possible.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
