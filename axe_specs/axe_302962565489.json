{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "G & L Custom Superhawk Electric Guitar Up for sale is a G & L custom Superhawk electric guitar. This one was a project by someone before we acquired it. It features a G & L Superhawk neck that is attached to a non-original Telecaster style body. The body is NOT original to the neck. The neck has had its locking nut removed and the tuners on the headstock are non-original, as well (though they do say \"G & L\" on them). There is some wear in the finish on both the neck and the body, as well some minor dents and dings. The guitar plays well and was gone over in our shop. I have more pictures I can send upon request of the guitar with its neck off (eBay no longer allows extra pictures in the listings). Pictures say the rest.
