{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "BC Rich Mockingbird Exotic Classic. Like new condition and totally hot rod-ed. I purchased this guitar brand new a couple of years ago. I did a complete makeover on the guitar and then put it up on my wall to enjoy. This guitar is in \u201clike new\u201d pristine condition-- no scratches, dings or scuffs anywhere. I've probably played his guitar no more than 10 minutes, so the frets are 100% intact and the neck is straight. The truss rod is in perfect working order. This guitar is made in Korea, and features a fully bound neck, and the upscale cloud inlays. These guitars are known for their neck-through design for better playability and unmatched sustain. The bridge and tailpiece have been upgraded to Tone-Pros. I've upgraded the entire guitar to including all gold parts. The Rockfield pickups have been upgraded to Seymour Duncan Slash Alnico II Pro gold pickups. These Slash pickup upgrades cost me $418, plus installation. I have included a snapshot of the receipt I've never been a big fan of the Rockfields, but I will include them in the case upon shipment if you want to revert back to the old ones. The Seymour Duncan's (or DiMarzzios) are what come standard in the US-made models. My intent was to take this guitar and make it as good as any of the US-custom made models. I've upgraded the machine heads to gold Grovers with the Imperial tuning pegs. The guitar also comes with a generic BC Rich blank hard shell case. NOTE There is a 1-2 inch bit of play within the case, its not a custom fitted case. Also the case has a 1 inch tear the black vinyl near the logo-noted in photo The guitar will be professionally packed and shipped promptly. Buyer pays for shipping. I live in Texas and will ship to the lower 48. Shipping with insurance typically runs approximately $110 -$130.
