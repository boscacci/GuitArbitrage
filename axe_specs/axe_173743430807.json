{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "PLEASE READ!For auction is a great Gretsch Duo Jet (Made in Japan) from the 2000s (?) customized to be a Malcolm Young style triple jet. Has some little scratches and knicks and the hardware has all be relic'd.Comes with a real rare vintage Burns bridge (no tremolo arm) which it is routed and mounted correctly. All pickups are Gretsch pickups. So here's the project part. The middle pickup is not yet wired but it was tested and functions. The routing by an aging luthier didnt do the cleanest job routing the middle pickup hole but the bezels do cover that up. He also did not put in secure wood mounts for the pickup screws so that will need to be attended to. I think he needs to finally retire. 3rd switch next to the pickup selector and tone switched is a dummy for the triple jet look. The other 2 toggle switches work as they should as do the neck and bridge pickups. All volume and tone knobs work too. The guitar sounds and plays great as is and I have tracked in the studio with it. Nice stringy, powerful and bright like you would expect. The neck is great, truss rod functions as it should. The previous owner had installed a strap button on the rear of the neck. Don't know why but I just left it. The mini toggle switches are also not functioning as they were meant to be rewired so the pickup selector and tone toggles could be unwired as in my years of playing Gretsch's I ALWAYS switch them during playing. Its up to you how you want that. Eventually i was planning on strippimg it and refinishing it like Malcolm Young's guitar but that never happened.Comes with some extra parts as pictured including a tun-o-matic style bridge, knobs and 4 vintage gold colored bezels with screws.It is a playable project guitar and so you must consider that it is not a done project and is not perfect. I tried and explain everything I could remember as this was a project from a couple of years ago. But I did plug it in and tested what was working and it still played and sounded awesome!Ships with a gig bag. NO hardshell case.No returns, sold as is. Thank you for looking!", "ItemID": "173743430807", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T04:22:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T04:22:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/GRETSCH-Triple-Jet-Custom-Duo-Guitar-Burns-Bridge-62-Malcolm-Young-READ-/173743430807", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "New Hope, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737434308078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PJwAAOSwpaVcPqoi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X50AAOSwuQhcPqo2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CG8AAOSwGq5cPqpO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CocAAOSwolpcPqpt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lysAAOSwCI5cPqro/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~rcAAOSw-rxcPqs3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jicAAOSwrHtcPqtP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XrAAAOSwfMlcPqth/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H~kAAOSws0pcPqt9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Xs4AAOSw~xtcPquM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o30AAOSwgfRcPqut/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wikAAOSwwZVcPqvF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "18938", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "punkpigpen", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2627, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.2}, "BidCount": 22, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 915.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 915.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 473}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "GRETSCH Triple Jet Custom Duo Guitar Burns Bridge 62 Malcolm Young READ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}]}, "HitCount": 767, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 925.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
