{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1985 Gibson Explorer 425 Body & NeckHere is a very cool project for you! This 1985 Explorer is the rare 425 model was only made for about a year. It features factory routes for a humbucker, two single coil pickups and Kahler bridge. The original owner stripped off most of the black finish and put a clear coat on. The body and neck combo weighs 6 lbs 8 oz. It has some scratches, dings and scuffs, but nothing out of the ordinary for a used body. One ding on the bottom corner. I'm not sure if the neck joint was ever re-glued, but I see no evidence of cracks in the wood or major repairs. No visible cracks on the headstock, so it should be a solid body and neck.The strings have been off of the neck for many years and it has a bit of an up bow, but should straighten out once you get the string tension back on it. The truss rod works and the neck is not twisted. The frets show some average wear, but no major dips. The fretboard and back of the neck are pretty clean. The headstock has some small dings around the edges, but no major issues. The original Gibson decal is still intact, but has some tape residue over it. The serial number and \"Made In USA\" are visible on the back.The only major issue is that the top has been sanded down and you will need to put shims under the bridge to raise it back up again. I'm selling it as-is and will not accept it back for a return. This part was removed from a genuine American made Gibson Explorer 425. The serial number dated it to November 1985 and the pots dated to August 1985.I still have the Tuners and Pots from this guitar for sale, so please check my other listings.
