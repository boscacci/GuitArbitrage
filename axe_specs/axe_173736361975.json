{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I'm selling part of my guitar collection to help a family member with medical expenses. Please don't buy if you have any reservations- any set back will directly affect my family. Thank you! Check out my other listings. This my other Fender John Mayer. It is all original. It plays and sounds great. I added locking tuners and tusq string tree because I like fast string changes and it helps with tuning. Included: guitar, factory Mayer soft case, case candy pictures, original tuners, whammy bar, bridge chrome cover.This guitar is in excellent condition. No dents, no repairs, no electronic issues. You will find some handling and polishing scratches, and a couple of scuffs but nothing bellow the finish. I 'm confident that you can buff them out if you so wish. At most, you will find a couple of pencil tip imperfections. I took some unflattering pics with flash since it makes imperfections stand out- again, I aim for transparency.This is a very good looking guitar. Rest assured that it is a solid 8.5-9 coming from a super picky PRS guy. Pickups are the highly coveted John Mayer and sound killer. It's et up with 9-42's with mid-low action and bridge on deck. I've been playing for 26 years and take outmost care of my guitars-this guitar comes from a very good home/collection as you can see in the last picture.Sale is final since. Please ask questions before buying.
