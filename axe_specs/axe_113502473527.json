Kruspe RZK-II BURNT is now available in an ESP E-II version. Previous only offered from the ESP Custom Shop, the E-II RZK-II BURNT is built by the luthiers at our ESP factory in Japan. It takes the single-cutaway Eclipse shape and presents it in a remarkably distressed finish with burn marks and gouges over its top and headstock. The RZK-II BURNT offers an alder body and maple neck in neck-thru-body construction for terrific sustain and tone. It&rsquo;s built at a 25.5&rdquo; scale, slightly longer than a typical Eclipse. The guitar also provides a rosewood fingerboard with 24 extra-jumbo frets and white neck binding. Its high-end professional components include Gotoh tuners, Schaller straplocks, a Floyd Rose Original tremolo, and a pair of brushed chrome EMG 81 active pickups for a super aggressive sound.
