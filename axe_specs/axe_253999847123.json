{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 2011, 60 year anniversary Telecaster. Made in the USA. Alder body. It\u2019s a 62 reissue, yet the pickups and electronics have all been changed. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful guitars I\u2019ve ever owned. Block inlays in the neck, double bound body. It\u2019s unique. I bought this guitar with this after market bridge already on it. I experiment with pickups all the time and I felt that this guitar needed a middle pickup. Currently it has a Gibson \u201857 classic in the neck with a relic cover. As well as Kent Armstrong pickups in the middle and bridge position. Along with Telluride Music Company, we put a 5 way \u201csuper\u201d switch and tried many combos of wiring, finally settling on this arrangement: Position 5 - Neck Humbucker. Position 4 - Middle pickup. Position 3 - Bridge Pickup. Position 2 - Middle and Bridge. Position 1 - All three. Separately, each pickup has a great sound. Position 2 sounds very Strat like. All three is somewhat underwhelming, just being honest. Electric guitars are so easy to change up with the electronics side of things, you can put what ever you want in this thing and have a great guitar. I routed a box style cavity under the pick guard to fit many different types of pickups. The middle route is not deep enough for a humbucker. There\u2019s a few dings in the body from the previous owner. It also has gold tuners that are slightly aged. It comes in a hard case. Free shipping. Being in Telluride, Colorado I\u2019m not sure if UPS or Fed Ex will be shipping it. But I\u2019ll cover it.
