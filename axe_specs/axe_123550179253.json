{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 2009 Gibson Les Paul Traditional plus. I purchased the guitar new in early 2010, so it must be a late 2009 model. It has a nice flame that is not overpowering. The back is a brown tone mahogany. This was an impulse purchase for me and I have only played it a couple of times. The condition is really \"as new\" apart from a tiny little ding on the edge of the headstock (see last photo). I think this little ding must have been there since new as I really have hardly had the guitar out of the case and you really have to look to see it. The rest of the guitar is flawless. It comes with the original case, manual and paperwork as seen in photo. Case is mint with no marks. If you want an almost \"as new\" honeyburst, this is the guitar for you. You also get the original packing box. Weight of guitar is approx. 9 lbs.", "ItemID": "123550179253", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T05:27:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-17T18:13:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2009-Gibson-Les-Paul-Traditional-Plus-Honey-Burst-w-Case-and-promo-items-/123550179253", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Stowe, Vermont", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235501792538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/EpQAAOSwkHxcF90s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/BkQAAOSwa3lcF90-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/ZnEAAOSwWAhcF91Y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/9yAAAOSwgbdcF91I/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/zREAAOSwE~ZcF91R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/HTMAAOSwH1pcF91u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/06AAAOSwXitcF911/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/vpgAAOSwSudcF92M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/0rYAAOSwj-RcF92w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/YPIAAOSwLgpcF92B/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "05672", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "daveglenna", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 160, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 273}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2009 Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Honey Burst w/Case and promo items\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2009"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Traditional Plus"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Items Included", "Value": ["Case and items that came with guitar"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Honey Burst"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 549, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
