{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2006 Schecter Raider 6-string electric guitar, in good condition. Kind of a rare item, I believe these were only made for one year, and only offered through Guitar Center... that's what I believe to be true. I guess the eye catching feature of his guitar is the inlays. Crossbones inlays with a skull and crossbones at the 12th fret. Kind of unique. Active Duncan Design humbuckers, 3-way pickup selector switch, 1 volume 1 tone control. The electronics work as they should. An overall good condition structurally. No cracks or breaks anywhere. The paint is mostly glossing, though it has lost a little gloss here and there, especially on top. Some of the paint has worn off around the edges. Not unattractive at all though. A few minor nicks and dings. Just looks like it's been played some. The other eye-catching feature of this listing is the cat eating in the background behind picture number one. That's a stray that wandered up into the yard, and we've been feeding him for about a year now. Feel free to make a separate offer on the cat. I will find a gig bag for it (the guitar), it didn't come with one, but I've got some laying around. Special note: thanks to eBay's new ridiculous fee for setting a reserve price, I'm listing this is a buy it now instead of my usual auction format. Getting pretty sick of eBay, frankly Please use eBay shipping calculator to figure shipping cost to where you are. Due to the silly CITES restrictions, I am no longer able to ship internationally. Sorry, I hate that. Please write with any questions you might have. Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, no hassles.
