{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2016 MIM Fender Stratocaster purchase new at a local music store. I am the original owner. All of the electronics are from a Fender American Standard Stratocaster, which includes treble bleed and greasebucket tone circuity. The pickups are from Stewart MacDonald, alnico 5 Golden Age pickups, which to my ear sound better than any American Fender Custom Shop pickup I have ever tried and I have tried just about all of them. The tuners have also been upgraded to Fender locking tuners, the tremolo block is a solid brass block from FU-Tone, which has resulted in a nice warm full body tone, without any loss to the traditional Stratocaster tone. As you can see in the picture it comes with either black covers and knobs or vintage cream, both sets are included. Also as you can see I have shielded the control and pickup cavities to clean up any unwanted electrical interference, although it was very quiet before doing this so it probably wasn't even necessary. There are a couple of dings to the finish only, which I have tried to take pictures of. One is on the top side of the body and the other one is on the bottom side of the body. It's only on the surface nothing structural. Included is a locking Fender Tweed hard case, and all of the hang tags, sticker price, original receipt, Fender sticker, and everything else that came with the guitar new. This guitar feels and sounds fantastic. I have owned several American Stratocasters and none has ever felt as good as this one. As I said before about the pickups, they sound better than any Fender product I have ever tried out. They are very balanced and full-bodied with plenty of that familiar jangle you want from a Stratocaster. The bidding starts at $99.99 and whatever it goes for, it goes for. Time for me to thin the herd!On Jan-12-19 at 14:37:10 PST, seller added the following information: This is a RIGHT HANDED guitar and I just noticed in the pictures that there are 3 black tone knobs. This winner will receive 1 volume knob and 2 tone knobs, unless you want 3 tone knobs...let me know.", "ItemID": "123590609804", "EndTime": "2019-01-18T21:02:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-11T21:02:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Mexican-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Strat-/123590609804", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Twin Falls, Idaho", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235906098048080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VIUAAOSw5wNcOQCP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eZgAAOSwlkpcOQCS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8tQAAOSw3BJcOQCW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ycoAAOSwKSlcOQCY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ALIAAOSwpFtcOQCb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nvgAAOSwOt5cOQCe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X5AAAOSwwFNcOQCh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lz0AAOSwcttcOQCk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HIgAAOSwylBcOQCn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vQYAAOSwieFcOQCp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sngAAOSwQ9lcOQCs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iesAAOSwzwVcOQCv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "83301", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "2011flhtk", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 439, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 47, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 435.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 435.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 399}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Mexican/American Standard Stratocaster Strat", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["113000705"]}]}, "HitCount": 1366, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 440.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "137068793", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
