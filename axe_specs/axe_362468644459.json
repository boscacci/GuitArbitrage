{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction here is one previously owned 2005 Gibson Les Paul Standard solid body electric guitar with its original hard shell case. The guitar was made at the Nashville Plant Tennessee on April 18th, 2005. It features an attractive sunburst finish and Gibson's vintage style hardware. There is some surface wear from previous use including minor scuffs, scratches, and dings, but there are no visible breaks, chips, or damage. It has not been cleaned, so there is some minor grime from age and storage, but the guitar was tested and remains in excellent functioning condition. This will be a fine addition to any collection.
