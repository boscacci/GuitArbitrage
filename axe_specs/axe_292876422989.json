{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2017 Gibson Flying V Custom Shop - Faded Cherry Condition:This guitar is in excellent condition. This guitar is all original, no modifications. There are no dings or dents. There is a raised section of the nitro finish on the front where your arm would rest. I'm not quite sure what this was due to as I'm the 2nd owner at least. It is hard to notice. It kind of looks like extra clear nitro finish. However, I want to be up front about it. I tried my best to capture it in my photos. There have been no repairs of any kind. See detailed pictures of the actual guitar. I keep all of my guitars well maintained, waxed, wiped down, strings changed (on 11/15/18), in their cases and boxed in a climate controlled room. Comes with the vacuumed Gibson OHS case & case candy. I'm totally upfront about the condition of my guitars that I sell so there are no surprises or disappointments when you open the package. I have too much respect for someone's hard earned money. Just check out my feedback. This is not a business; just a fun & honest hobby. I simply buy, play and then sell for someone else to enjoy. I'm a clean-freak so you know you are getting a well cared for guitar.This guitar plays great and is very smooth. I played it a few times. I just can't get into the body style of the Flying V. I'm more of an Explorer player. It's a beautiful and wonderfully made guitar.
