{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A very nice 1996 MIM Fender Duo-Sonic short scale guitar. Looks great and fun to play! Body Dated Feb 20 1996 and Neck Mar 27 1996. The neck has a beautiful aged look and is in great condition - frets have been leveled and polished and look very good. Body has the expected scratches & minor dings for a guitar of this vintage. The only large scar is a gouge in the guitar body edge just below the cable jack. See pictures. It wasn't filled and smoothed but the paint match is very good. Also, there is a chip in the finish alongside the bottom strap connector. Other than that the guitar looks great. A very nice shiny red. A few minor dings in the lower back of the neck - not at all serious. Please zoom into the pictures. The pickguard has been upgraded to a 3-ply and the pickup selector to a high quality CTS switch. Electronics all work fine. Payment is due promptly at end of auction. If you cannot comply, please do not bid. Item is guaranteed as described \u2013 otherwise non-returnable. I generally ship by the end of the next business day. Please look at pictures closely \u2013 I do my best to photograph and what you see is what you get! Sale is for the guitar only - no additional accessories. And do contact me if you have any questions or wood like any additional detail. Thank you!", "ItemID": "223266438819", "EndTime": "2018-12-04T12:26:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T02:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Duo-Sonic-Electric-Guitar-1996-Torino-Red-Made-Mexico-Nice-/223266438819", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Litchfield, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232664388198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/PFYAAOSwtjhcAsNk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/6CwAAOSwl7dcAsQK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/vyYAAOSw5YlcAsPb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/bNEAAOSw0xtcAsPv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/mGQAAOSwIKNcAbj-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/IXIAAOSwFx5cAsQ8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/LGwAAOSwhexcAsOZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/1F8AAOSwWrxcAsRl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/5IsAAOSwGVFcAsQg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/1p8AAOSw2~NcAsR1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/Y68AAOSwqiJcAsR7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/9-0AAOSwaepcAsSD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06759", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "vintageflybynight", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 541, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 195.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 195.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 244}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Duo-Sonic Electric Guitar -1996 - Torino Red - Made in Mexico.
