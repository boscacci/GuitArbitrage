{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "RELISTED: This was sold, during delivery to the buyer the case was cracked. Minor, but they were concerned. There was no damage to the guitar, it is in perfect playing condition. I had it checked at my local shop. Still a great buy and you'll be very happy with this guitar. I also knocked $100 of the original price and $50 off the shipping. I had it listed for $1250 and $150 shipping (incl insurance). Wow, this was a fun birthday present for myself...lol.I admit the G-Force tuning took a while to get used to, but turns out it is pretty cool. Especially if you want to quickly change between Open or Custom tunings. I dug the coil splitting for creating different sounds and the wider neck as I play a lot of acoustic (Fender, Martin, Yamaha) so this was quite comfortable. Plus you gotta love that sound!Again, hate to sell, but she needs a good home as well. Reintroduced in 2015, the Les Paul Deluxe ditches full sized humbucker pickups for a pair of Firebird-style mini humbuckers. Like most 2015 Gibson models, it features the G-Force electronic tuning system, brass zero-fret nut, a wider neck profile, and a limited edition logo and hologram commemorating Les Paul's 100th birthday.
