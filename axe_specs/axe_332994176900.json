{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 1985 Squier Bullet 1 (Serial number E605251) made in the FujiGen factory in Japan. It in the condition you would expect for a guitar that is 34 years old including various nicks, dings and scratches as well as some warping of the pickguard due to wood shrinkage. The three most important flaws with the guitar are a relatively large chip (roughly 1 inch across) on the back side of the body, near the strap button which appears to have been colored over with some sort of ink, however I can not confirm this as I am not the first owner. The second flaw is a missing screw for the backplate (the trem cover, NOT the neck plate). Third is a scratchy volume pot however that could be easily replaced. Action is a bit high, although not unplayable and could be adjusted with a setup to your preference. Neck is straight, and guitar is overall very clean. Features a full gloss maple neck with a walnut plug at the headstock where the truss rod is installed (usually found on American standards) a full sized trem block, FENDER branded saddles and tuning machines. Comes with the original trem bar which does appear to have been scratched against the strings a lot as it is very worn on one side. Shipping and handling will be paid for by the purchaser. The item will be shipped in an appropriately sized box and packed carefully in bubble wrap. If you require it be shipped in a hard case we can discuss pricing for that as well as part of negotiations. I\u2019m also open to negotiate the price if there is something that you believe was not accounted for in the price, I try to be as fair as possible. Comparable guitars are listed on reverb for as much as 699+shipping, albeit in slightly better condition so I believe 300 is fair for the condition mine is in. Feel free to ask any questions you may have and have a nice day. Thank you for looking!", "ItemID": "332994176900", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T14:09:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T14:09:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squier-Bullet-1-/332994176900", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Carmel, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329941769008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/T44AAOSwo6NcLhKs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j4EAAOSwYUZcLhLY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZSoAAOSwmkBcLhK0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c9kAAOSwHSdcLhKn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kxwAAOSwt0dcLhKd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/78sAAOSwIqxcLhLb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0dkAAOSwA3xcLhLV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9YwAAOSwVIBcLhKv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aTgAAOSwjmRcLhK3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bfgAAOSwip5cLhKx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7okAAOSwMd1cLhLR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qmwAAOSwWH1cLhgY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "46032", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "shanhickma-0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 70, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 133.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 133.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 178}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squier Bullet 1", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}]}, "HitCount": 86, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 135.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
