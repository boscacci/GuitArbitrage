We are focused on really good guitars, pedals and accessories, at really good prices. Our Customers tell us they feel we are a special kind of dealer, more of a neighborhood Guitar store than one of the Biggies. We are liked for our small footprint. We are a longtime guitar and accessory provider for players and collectors. We sell only online and limit our Guitars and other items to very special & quality items. Browse our feedback. . . As do the thousands of others we've served, we think you will like our offerings, prices and, definitely our service. We are open to working with you when you want to trade in your guitar(s) and accessories and are happy to provide quotes. Our trade in rates are commensurate with the industry's leading dealers. We respect when you want to make an offer and accept offers that are reasonable. You may want to email for a copy of the trade in policy. We like the idea of letting you help set the price. We also hate disappointing so, when you are going to make an offer consider \"reasonable\" is defined as a offer price that includes profit. Margins on guitars listed are relatively low. Offers that are \"Low-ball\" won't work since to accept such an offer would not be a really good business model to follow. This is especially true when we have already marked down a guitar. The being said, if there is room for an acceptable profit in an offer, we will accept that offer. We have perfect feedback most of which commend our integrity, sterling, very fast service and fair pricing. We have also been a pioneer in services like layaway (eBay now does not permit us to offer it) super-safe, super-fast shipping, responding to requests to find special guitars, etc. You will want to look for the eBay Markdowns. The markdowns are great buys and all Markdowns sales final. Since anyone can brag, we'd like to invite you to shop us and give us the chance to prove we deserve you.
