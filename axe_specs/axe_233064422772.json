{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Extremely clean, light and lively. A delightful instrument ready to change your life. Would look fresh and as new hanging in any music store. Can only find one small ding in the top of the head stock. Hard to believe what great shape this lovely vintage is in right not. These are only going up in value. Body shows literally almost no sign of use. Pickguard is fresh. Some birdseye on the neck. Very resonate and a joy to play. I have purchased a 1960 hardtail strat so I need to pass this one along. Great playing guitar and a open door to collecting. Actually comes up on my digital scale as 6.9 pounds but I am calling it 7. Includes original case, still has the ashtray in perfect shape, hang tag, owners manual and keys to the case still in the plastic bag just like they left Fender. An absolute delight of an instrument. U.S. sales only. Thanks for looking. Let me know if you have any questions.", "ItemID": "233064422772", "EndTime": "2018-12-30T16:54:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-23T16:54:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Light-minty-fresh-Fender-Stratocaster-1977-Butterscotch-hardtail-/233064422772", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "South Windsor, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330644227728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/2X4AAOSwHrlb-yA6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/HoAAAOSwCTpb-yA9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/SHIAAOSweX5b-yBB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/lWQAAOSwNphb-yBG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/VoIAAOSwzd9b-yBK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/tqsAAOSwNJlb-yBO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/I~AAAOSwYd5b-yBR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/p~kAAOSwe9Fb-yBW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "06074", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "musicden", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1665, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 315}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Light minty fresh Fender Stratocaster 1977 Butterscotch hardtail", "HitCount": 191, "Subtitle": "Perfect time capsule of the 70s, but only weighs 7 lbs.", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1775.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
