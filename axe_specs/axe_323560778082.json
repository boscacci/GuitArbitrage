{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you're here, you know what you're looking for and what it's worth..... Long out of production but highly sought the legendary Parker Fly Supreme in Transparent Honey. The best of the best. Made by hand at the original Wilmington MA factory by Ken (before all the moves/expansions/sale/automation). The craftsmanship is immaculate, the guitar practically vibrates ready to be played. The grain of the wood really glows. Unused by first owner then bought by me, then setup by Pat DiBurro/DiBurro guitars who usually does restorations of high-end Taylor acoustics and such but is also an expert Parker tech who works out of his shop in Exceter NH. Then put away while I built a family and stored in a climate-controlled room until now. Basically unplayed, you won't find a better supreme for this era.Own a part of guitar history. Absolutely pristine with original hard case (fantastic condition) and every piece of case-candy/literature/stickers (still in plastic). Will be adding more/actual pictures shortly.
