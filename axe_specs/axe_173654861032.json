{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "What the heck? Check out this ultra-groovey Brian May custom creation! I don't know the original make of this instrument...somebody very talented has created a highly customized one-of-a-kind rock n' roll bumblebee that plays like a dream. Normally, cool or quirky guitars are simply that - cool and quirky (but usually not fun to play), but this little minx is just the opposite. This guitar is quality throughout. 3 Telecaster pickups were used to replace whatever was there to begin with, a Bigsby-style tremolo was added, and an awesome roller bridge was swapped in. The neck feels wonderful...dead straight with super low action; rosewood capped, 24 frets (with a zero fret, which I love). The 24\" scale, unique to Brian May's \"Red Special\" is replicated here, allowing you to bend to the moon and back. The roller bridge an a graphite nut keep this baby in tune regardless of how wildly you feel like playing. The combination of on/off and phase switches gives this guitar an incredible range of tones (give Queen's \"A Night at the Opera\" a listen as a reminder). Some shielding may be added to cut down on the typical telecaster hum, but I never got around to it. The guitar is probably about 10 years old (I've had it for 7) and has been played but well cared for. No chips, gouges, or notable dents. The neck is pristine. If you are looking for a unique guitar that NOBODY else has...this may be what you're looking for. Will come well-packed and includes a quality gig bag.
