{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great looking, great playing, and with the Telenator Mod 1 upgrade in the Wide Range Humbucking neck pickup and the Seymour Duncan Designed TE-101B single-coil pickup in the bridge, you can dial in a lot of great tones. Put the pickup selector in the middle and get a mix of sweet warm and spank sparkle. Dial in just the right balance to your ears by mixing the blend with the 4 skirted tone and volume knobs. In the neck position, you get a fat sound but with improved clarity and detail over Non-Wide Range humbuckers. In the bridge position, well, you know that Tele twang. This comes with the hard shell case and with the Telenator Mod 1. In the words of the now retired Telenator: \u201cWe take a different approach to the WRHB than some of the other pickup makers in that we recognize not everyone is going to want to shell our big money for pickups that claim to nail the tone of the original vintage WRHB. So we offer a few different options to suit different budgets and different ears. The main thing I think we can all agree on is, the Re-issue WRHB's need help. They just don't sound that good. If you're looking for a major improvement in tone for $85, our MOD1 will get you there. It does not sound like the vintage original, but is way better than the stock re-issue. Get out of the mud! This mod adds sparkle and life to your Re-issue Wide Range Humbuckers! Our alnico II plain magnets take the place of the steel screws in this pickup. We remove the bar magnet from under the stock coils since it's no longer needed and completely re-assemble it into a great sounding pickup. We press in our custom length alnico II magnets at a subtle stagger to produce an even, balanced sound. You get tighter lows, added sparkle and wonderfully complex harmonics that just do not exist in the stock pickup. This mod sounds best with the stock 250k pots that are already in your guitar! This mod also works particularly well with a single coil Tele bridge pickup because they both use 250k pots and MOD1 is only 8k. Just drop the pickup in and start playing!\u201d Here\u2019s a demo of this model guitar. It sounds pretty good even without the upgrade: https://youtu.be/z80hdS36aDI", "ItemID": "233064676974", "EndTime": "2018-12-26T19:46:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-23T19:46:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squier-Vintage-Modified-Telecaster-Custom-Electric-Guitar-/233064676974", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Portland, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330646769748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQy/z/2ZcAAOSwEVlcDtyZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc4WDE2MDA=/z/LZgAAOSwtgZcDtiJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NjY=/z/g~8AAOSwJtJcDtpn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODgyWDE2MDA=/z/u4sAAOSw4vpcDtiE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LCQAAOSw-4JcDtwN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzE0/z/-oAAAOSwtFxcDtiM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gwAAAOSw76lcDtia/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aPYAAOSwdxVcDtih/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyMlgxNjAw/z/P-kAAOSw0~pcDtiT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAyWDE2MDA=/z/Z10AAOSwPXFcDtiG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4QsAAOSwH2VcDtie/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjM4/z/650AAOSwjMtcDtiX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "97205", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "webevb", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 61, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 239.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 239.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squier Vintage Modified Telecaster Custom Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Agathis"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["32750", "327502506"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["32750"]}]}, "HitCount": 164, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 242.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78668697", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
