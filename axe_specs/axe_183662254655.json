{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "My first \"Waylon\" Leather Tele of 2019! Please read the full description!The guitar itself is a near mint 2017 Fender 50's Classic Series Baja Telecaster.The guitar itself I acquired recently from Guitar Center, used. It is 100% Fender Factory original with the exception of the added Schaller Banjo D-Tuner (like Waylon used, the original tuner is included), and of course the leather cover. The tuner cost me $85. The cover is made from Hermann Oak premium A-grade leather and then hand-tooled, colored, and laced by me. I put many hours in the detail and visual appeal. The look is pretty self-explanatory. Pay close attention to the photos to appreciate the attention to detail and depth of the tooling work. You will not find this kind of depth and detail on eBay for this price. In fact, leather crafters can charge upwards of $2500 for the cover alone. This particular cover is what I call the \"Worn Waylon.\" I purposely add a smoke black stain gel to enhance the tooling detail and it gives the cover a sort of worn-in look as opposed to the typical super-white pattern. It is still white, but the smoky gel makes it look very cool, with almost a vintage appearance. It even has the same effect to the back's detail. I must admit, I prefer this look over the all-white version. The details and depth of the tooling is much more visible and dramatic. Plus, it's a lot easier to play and not worry about getting the ultra-white color dirty. The guitar is a special-run by Fender. It's basically a 1950's Classic Reissue Telecaster with the Fender S-1 circuitry:The S-1 is a specialized Telecaster model with a four-way blade switch rather than the three-way switch typically found on most Telecasters. Without engaging the S-1 switch, the first three blade switch positions deliver standard Telecaster wiring, with a special in-series fourth position that creates a thicker tone with more output. Like so:Position one: bridge pickup onlyPosition two: bridge and neck pickups in parallelPosition three: neck pickup onlyPosition four: neck and bridge pickups in seriesEngaging the S-1 switch on this particular Telecaster introduces out-of-phase circuitry to blade switch positions two and four only, with positions one and three remaining unaffected. This produces a thinner and more-hollow tone of the kind often heard in, for example, funk and early electric blues. Like so:Position one: bridge pickup onlyPosition two: bridge and neck pickups in parallel and out of phasePosition three: neck pickup onlyPosition four: neck and bridge pickups in series and out of phase The brand new hardshell black tolex Road Runner case shown is included.
