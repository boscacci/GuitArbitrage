{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a early Fullerton American vintage re issue. Completely original with a couple of paint dings. This guitar has all matching numbers, the pick ups are coveted red bobbin and they sound amazing! In 1982 black was a special order color, documented in the neck cavity. (Shims also original). Guitar has the three way pup selector installed, the five way switch that also came with the guitar is missing. The tremolo bar is not original to this guitar. This guitar has not been played much. I bought this guitar last Christmas for my grandson. Being an old timer I just assumed he would love it. It\u2019s super collectible and a great player! Well I assumed wrong, he liked it but wanted a telecaster like \u201cJohn 5\u201d or an Ibanez. So I bought him an Ibanez and I decided to keep the strat. I\u2019m almost 63 and I really don\u2019t need another guitar that doesn\u2019t get played, so I\u2019m listing it. I took the guitar apart to photograph. I put the guitar back together. When I bought the start I had it professionally set up and it plays great. Buyer will have to prepare to set it up to their specs. But that\u2019s the price of the dismantling for photos. If you\u2019re looking for an early reissue you will find no nicer than this guitar. I paid $3200. I\u2019m putting a 2800. Starting bid and please contact me with any questions.
