{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Rare \"Gold Top\" Tom Anderson Classic here! Tom Anderson has been building guitars since the 1970s and his mission is simple. Build the best guitars -period. I have been playing/collecting guitars since the mid 1980s and I have yet to find a more consistently exceptional builder in the boutique market. This strat is no exception. It's light weight but extremely resonant. My belief about electric guitars; Strum it unplugged, you kneed to be able to hear each note, feel the body resonate and listed for sustain. There is no fix for bad design, dead wood or poor quality -you can swap out pickups, pots, change frets etc but you will never fix a bad guitar. This guitar really sings acoustically. The M series pickups are outstanding! No hum, huge tone but with amazing balance and so articulate -a rare combination that enables this guitar to cover loads of sonic ground. It can handle anything you play with ease. The frets are are immaculate, the satin tinted neck is better than butter! Comes with Build Sheet, original hard shell case and trem arm. God bless and thank you for looking -Patrick aka 316Guitars!", "ItemID": "202488311720", "EndTime": "2018-11-06T03:52:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-01T03:52:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Tom-Anderson-Classic-NO-RESERVE-Ships-world-wide-/202488311720", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Eden Prairie, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2024883117208080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/UAwAAOSwxaVbqoP~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/1DEAAOSwtAlbqoa-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDQ4/z/ka8AAOSw0VZbqoQJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/7gMAAOSwtspbqoQQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/ZYQAAOSwAclbqoQg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/v2wAAOSw~p1bqoQn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/SxsAAOSwn1FbqobH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/n8YAAOSwQQtbqoQx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/HQoAAOSwyPlbqoQ2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/ZgUAAOSwa3ZbqoQ5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "55346", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "316guitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 462, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1899.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1899.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 18}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Tom Anderson Classic NO RESERVE Ships world wide", "HitCount": 126, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1924.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "An item that has been used previously.
