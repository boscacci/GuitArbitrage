{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hondo Black Right Handed Electric Guitar 715 Series from the 1990s This Hondo Black Right Handed Electric Guitar 715 Series from the 1990s is in very good condition. I bought this electric guitar for my husband who wanted to learn guitar in the 1990s. He proudly displayed the guitar on the stand but never took a lesson or played it. It was played once by someone else who came to the house. After 20 plus years, I have decided he will never take lessons. This guitar should be played by some one who enjoys creating music. I do NOT have a soft or hard case for the guitar. The guitar stand shown in the photos is NOT included with the guitar. You will receive the guitar and shoulder strap only. Please ask any and all questions. Please zoom in on photos for more description and detail.It would make a great addition to your home or a great gift Please look at all photos as they are part of the description I have several other great items listed so please look at them in my store and many other items Please ask any and all questions for quick answers or for additional photos I do combine shipping If you are happy with your purchase, please leave feedback, if not please contact me so I can resolve any issue.", "ItemID": "113472474759", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T18:20:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-20T21:58:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Hondo-Black-Right-Handed-Electric-Guitar-715-Series-1990s-/113472474759", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Richmond Hill, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134724747598080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0xgAAOSwBkBcHAHG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rIkAAOSwzd9cHAHX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4Q4AAOSwbKdcHAHl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iAQAAOSwrQ5cHAH1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6EwAAOSw~odcHAIK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xksAAOSwLgpcHAIn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4WgAAOSwbKdcHAI7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUyWDg3OQ==/z/CVMAAOSwFZZcHAJS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r1EAAOSwcOZcHAJh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kI0AAOSwcDdcHAJ0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MvQAAOSwQqZcHAKW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X1MAAOSw-2hcHAKh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "31324", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "beany1963", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2450, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 224.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 224.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1032}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Hondo Black Right Handed Electric Guitar 715 Series from the 1990s ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Hondo"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Tone knob", "Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Hondo 715"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["Shoulder strap"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Unknown"]}]}, "HitCount": 38, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=122408360", "StoreName": "beany1963"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Seller", "InternationalRefund": "MoneyBack", "InternationalReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsAccepted", "InternationalShippingCostPaidBy": "Seller"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["YE"], "TopRatedListing": true, "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Pre-owned and in very good condition.
