{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For Sale: Rare Early 80's Cort 6/12 Double Neck Electric Guitar. Copy of a Gibson EDS-1275. Guitar is in truly excellent condition. Just a few small dings (way less than typical guitar of this age). The only damage I know of is the 6 string rhythm pickup ring is broken. Guitar is all mahogany construction with set necks, rosewood fingerboards with block inlay. Guitar has been upgraded with Sperzel locking machine heads on both necks, Dimarzio pickups and a fine tuner style tailpiece on the 6 string neck. All hardware is in really decent shape and everything appears to work. Both fingerboards are flat and both necks are perfectly straight. Finish is walnut brown (similar to older Gibson SG) and in great shape. This is a truly exceptional axe! Guitar comes with original factory HSC. Guitar will be securely packaged and shipped within 3 days of payment. US buyers only. All items sold as is, no returns. Thanks for shopping with us.
