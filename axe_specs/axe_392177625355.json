This is a X-Series KVXT. Awesome Guitar for Metal and Hard Rock. Super Fast Neck. Emg Humbucker pickups. From The Web:The King of Metal Guitars X Series King V\u2122 guitars are Jackson\u2019s most regal shred machines, affordably attired with innovative design elements and modern features that deliver monster tone and ultra-fast playability for the latest generation of shredders. Built with nearly 40 years of Jackson expertise, the KVXT features a basswood body, through-body maple neck with graphite reinforcement and scarf joint for great playing comfort. Hosting 24 jumbo frets and pearloid sharkin inlays, the 12\u201d- 16\u201d compound radius bound rosewood fingerboard curves more powerfully at the nut for easy chording and flattens out as it approaches the body for low action bends without fretting out. EMG\u00ae HZ H4-B and HZ H4-AN humbucking pickups deliver well-balanced tone with tight bass, glassy mids and crunching highs. Other fine features include three-way toggle switching and a TOM-style fully adjustable bridge for thick sustain.Fine-tuned for aggressive playing You'll have the tonal power you need with the Jackson King V KVXT. The combination of the King V KVXT's balanced-sounding and light-weight basswood body, its stable maple neck, and the added sustain from the high-energy strings-through-body construction, gives you an even tone that will cut through any metal mix. Not to mention, the King V's body contours are among the most aggressive and iconic in metal.Built for speed Not many guitar necks play faster than the Jackson King V KVXT's rosewood fretboard with 12\"-16\" compound radius. The radiused fretboard makes chords easier to form close to the nut, and is flatter up the neck for faster lead lines. It also makes impossibly wide bends possible without fretting out. In other words, it's effortless to switch between rhythm and lead playing on the King V KVXT. And the fingerboard's binding and shark-fin inlay ensure everyone around know's you're playing a Jackson.EMG pickups for snarling, aggressive tone Jackson's X-series King V KVXT's pair of passive EMG humbuckers spit out enough power to pull the most harmonically rich gain from your amp possible. At the bridge, you get an EMGHz-4A, while offering tons of output, still sings with an extremely balanced tone. In the neck position, there's an EMGHz-4, voiced to give you the best of the company's 81 humbucker and a classic PAF-style pickup. And the HZs are likely the quietest passive pickups in existence, and (unlike actives), you never have to worry about dead batteries.Jackson King V KVXT Solidbody Electric Guitar Features: Brutally shaped electric guitar for metal A powerful combination of a fast-playing design and the full-bodied tone of Duncan Designed pickups Excellent sustain from the basswood body and the strings-through construction Compound radius fretboard plays fast and smooth Great intonation and stability from the TonePros adjustable bridge EMG HZ passive humbucking pickups for muscular tone with clarity Rosewood fingerboard with iconic shark-fin inlay Our luthier did a complete setup.
