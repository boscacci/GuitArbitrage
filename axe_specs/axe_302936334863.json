{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Jaguar body made by Warmoth in an aged Lake Placid Blue / Ocean Turquoise relic finish. The relic job / wear is not overdone, just a nice wear spot on the front and another on the back, and a few scratches throughout. See pictures! The large wear spots are very smooth, so it's a nice thin finish that will continue to relic over time. It also appears to have some other paint layers underneath the initial blue finish. Almost iridescent with some hints of gold in some spots where the wear is. The finish itself has more of a greenish Turquoise hue to it than the royal blue you see in most Lake Placid Blue finishes. The second photo where I used the flash captures more of the true color, but it does vary depending on light. Very cool color, and would look great with a matching headstock neck. Finish some clouding and a couple paint goopy spots in some areas on the upper and lower horn on the front. The white scratches in the paint on the front should be covered up by the plates when you assemble this guitar completely. Does not look like a professional refinish job, but there are some really cool attributes here for your Jaguar project!These Warmoth bodies are top quality parts!!! These finished bodies go for around $300 brand new. Not sure if it's Alder or Ash, but it weighs 6.136 lbs on my digital scale. Not cheap feeling at all!Neck pocket is 3\" wide x 2 1/4\" in length. Has routes for Humbuckers if you decide to go that direction with your pickup selection, too! Or if you want single-coils, just install the correct pickguard and they'll screw right in and fit perfect. I ship fast!!! Bid with confidence!!! Payment due within the first 72 business hours of the item ending or I reserve the right to re-list the item. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "302936334863", "EndTime": "2018-10-30T15:26:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-27T19:01:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Warmoth-Fender-Jaguar-Body-Relic-Lake-Placid-Blue-Ocean-Turquoise-LPB-Refinish-/302936334863", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029363348638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/VhwAAOSwOuBbwPT-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/a1kAAOSwuZpbwPT6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/nyoAAOSwDOpbwPT6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/TCUAAOSwp8pbwPT6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/F58AAOSw7VtbwPT9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/e2QAAOSwjtZbwPT9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/UWkAAOSwOU9bwPT6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/ljYAAOSwKEFbwPT6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/JroAAOSwP6pbwPT7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/L0UAAOSwZKpbwPT9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/SywAAOSw5oxbwPT9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/f-MAAOSwDZ9bwPT4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60642", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "badbeet1982", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 70, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 166.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 166.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 418}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Warmoth Fender Jaguar Body Relic Lake Placid Blue, Ocean Turquoise LPB Refinish", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Warmoth"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Jaguar HH"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Offset"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Turquoise"]}]}, "HitCount": 76, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 168.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
