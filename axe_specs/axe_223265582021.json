{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "As I recall I bought this in the mid or late 80s. Playing off and on over that time is it well used but good condition considering it\u2019s age. Inevitably has fret wear and numerous pick scratches (see pics) but plays well. Kahler tremolo alone is valuable. Original case in good shape with a few nicks. Shipping to lower 48 states only. Pointy guitars have large cases and oversized shipping boxes = more costly shipping, sorry. If you don\u2019t want to pay the shipping/handling/insurance cost listed then this is not the guitar for you. Rock on! Thanks. Bought it new at H&H music in San jacinto mall in Baytown Texas. All original except for schaller strap locks. Never had it set up professionally but I have played all the high notes in response to a question and hear no fret buzz issue. Probably could use its first professional set up after all these years but I have never felt the need. I play for a few years, take maybe 4-5 years off, and play a few more years, repeat. Points on guitar are good, just one small dent/paint chip on end of upper back point, still black. Last picture is information about the guitar off the internet. I have more pics just ask. No returns so ask whatever you need to, no problem.", "ItemID": "223265582021", "EndTime": "2018-12-08T07:08:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-01T07:08:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Vortex-1-80-s-Vintage-Heavy-Metal-Guitar-Made-USA-Hardshell-Case-/223265582021", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Round Rock, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232655820218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I2IAAOSw~vNcAjGM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CiwAAOSwzgtcAjGA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CTUAAOSwVEFcAjGP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UMYAAOSwLNxcAjGH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/higAAOSwQZVcAjGK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lEsAAOSwHglcAjGC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bdoAAOSwcqxcAjGQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NQcAAOSwYd5cAjGN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aDIAAOSwaSVcAjGF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pScAAOSw5-hcAjGE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4mUAAOSw-iZcAjGJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA0Mlg4MTM=/z/YQAAAOSw~bhcAjF-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "78681", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kissmebaby", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 813, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 444.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 444.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 252}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey Vortex 1 80\u2019s Vintage Heavy Metal Guitar Made In USA With Hardshell Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vortex 1"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 396, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 449.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
