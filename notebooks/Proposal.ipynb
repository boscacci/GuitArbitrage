    "## Boscacci's Final Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What question/questions are you trying to solve?__\n",
    "* How well can we guess the final auction price of an (X) on eBay, before we list it?\n",
    "* How can I help my information security specialist friend classify and visualize incoming requests?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What are the outcomes you think you will find, and then so what?__\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is either trivial, challenging, or near-impossible to train an ML model to accurately guess the price of an (X)\n",
    "* The cyber-security field is either rife with opportunity for data science innovation, or too far out of my domain expertise for me to be helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__How would someone, or some entity take action upon learning this?__\n",
    "* In the event that my eBay model is confidently predictive, one could use it to help arbitrage goods across platforms.\n",
    "* In the event that my info-sec tool is useful, white-hat pen-testers could use it to visualize apache logs and things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What version this question would allow me to find an answer in 2-3 days?__\n",
    "* How accurate is an eBay predictive model that just goes off of the basic features (with no NLP or CNN action)?\n",
    "* What if we just visualized incoming web requests / Fail2ban logs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What version of this question would allow me/motivate me to work on this problem even after completing Flatiron School?__\n",
    "* For which eBay product category can I make the most accurate valuator model? Can I put it into practice?\n",
    "* What other tools can I make for the information security field?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What are some data sources that would allow you to answer this?__\n",
    "* eBay API\n",
    "* My friend in the NAVY\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What is the ideal data you would hope to gather to answer this question?__\n",
    "* Tens of thousands of previous eBay auctions\n",
    "* Tens of thousands of server logs and things\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What about potentially missing data, that could cause omitted variable bias?__\n",
    "* There might be a lot of this, so I will have to get creative about making my sparse data less sparse\n",
    "* Server logs will not have this problem mostly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__How will you present your data? Will it be a jupyter notebook presentation or a Dashboard.__\n",
    "* Dash was a good time, would use again\n",
    "* Ideally users can make a new eBay listing, run it through the model to get a price guess\n",
    "* Server log visualizations would be a geo-viz of some kind like a kepler.gl object of some kind\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__How will you use regression and/or classification?__\n",
    "* eBay value estimator will obviously guess the price of new listings\n",
    "* Info-Sec project would probably try to classify incoming requests as malicious, safe, or unknown or something\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What are the challenges you foresee with this project?__\n",
    "* Figuring out good model stacking and ninja feature engineering techniques\n",
    "* Domain-specific challenges having to do with the eBay API responses\n",
    "* 5000-request daily limit with eBay API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__What are your next steps moving forward?__\n",
    "* Making hecka requests to the eBay API and collecting data\n",
    "* Poking and prodding the data every which way possible\n",
    "* NLP pipeline for titles, description, condition description text\n",
    "* Think about how I might use the images to help guess price"
