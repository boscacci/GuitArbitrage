{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "These were my personal pair for 10+ years and have been my backup pair for a 3+ years now and haven't been worn since. Before retiring them I put in new Oakley polarized lenses, they are still scratch free. Nose pieces and ear socks were also replaced at the same time so are in near perfect condition. These glasses are great, comfortable and truly last a lifetime. Unfortunately Oakley no longer makes the lenses for these (otherwise I wouldn't be selling) and only makes the ear socks and nose pieces for these glasses. There are 3rd parties that make an array of lenses for them that I've included links to below. The lenses are exchanged with a small star tool on the bottom of the glasses (careful there is a small screw and rubber o-ring).
