There is a small scratch toward the top of the right lens on the inside which I have a photo of, and there are light surface scratches in a couple of other areas. (There are \"no deep scratches,\" or scuff marks, no damage to the lenses or metal frames or chipping to the sunglasses. If someone stood in front of you, they wouldn't notice any significant scratches or defects.) Also included is a brand spanking new Oakley Sunglasses Case bought from amazon original box for case included. Also, there is a microfiber bag included as well. These have been well taken care of over the time that I had them. The photos I've taken should provide authenticity I purchased these from an authorized dealer years ago. **", "ItemID": "283412390535", "EndTime": "2019-03-17T23:23:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-10T23:23:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Oakley-Nanowire-3-0-Sunglasses-Brown-Lenses-Very-Rare-Free-Shipping-/283412390535", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Delaware, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2834123905358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg5WDE2MDA=/z/0~wAAOSwfs1chZY1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQyMVgxNjAw/z/ynIAAOSwIVVchZY6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sNIAAOSwJrdchZY7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDMx/z/joUAAOSwaCVchZY9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WT8AAOSwRfRchZY9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8joAAOSwO7pchZY-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExNVgxNjAw/z/kg0AAOSwcSJchZY3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1p0AAOSwtLxchZY4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0NFgxNjAw/z/dgQAAOSwJFRchZY5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "43015", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "protagonist1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 58, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 620}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Oakley Nanowire 3.0 Sunglasses Brown Lenses Very Rare!
