{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here they are! Oakley X-Metal Romeo SunglassesGen 1 from 1998 Frames are metal in a dark grey Lenses are dark grey and show X METAL on left lens. Frames have no scratches! Lenses have only one scratch 1mm or less on each lens at the tops. Can't be see while wearing! They are hard to see when looking for them, but you can feel it is there when you rub your fingernail across the lenses. Just so you know they are there, but they don't show up in any of the photos. All flex joints are intact and work well! Hinges are tight! Nose pads are just like new, nice and rubbery! Ear tabs are in place, hold tightly and are very pliable to grip your head! Sunglasses feel nice and tight, no sloppy joints! Look at the photos, and see the two I shot through the lenses of the ear tabs. Crystal clear! Lenses are NOT polarized! Original Vault case is not included, although I am including a nice large Oakley soft sided case to protect these fine sunglasses. I have sold several pair of Oakley sunglasses here on ebay, and everyone was thrilled with their purchase. Last month I sold the mate to these, the Juliet X-Metal sunglasses. These Romeos are the last Oakleys I have for sale. Sunglasses are for a large head with a temple to temple size of 143mm. I have seen many Oakley sunglasses over the years, and I believe these Romeo X-Metal Gen 1 are the finest they have ever made! Many parts and different lenses are still available here on ebay for you to accessorize these any way you would like! Never worry about trusting my listings, as I take the photos, write the ad, wrap the item and address the package, then personally take it to the Post Office to ensure you are happy with your purchase. I never try to cover up flaws or avoid talking about blemishes. What good would that do me, as you would find them as soon as you received your package and looked over your item? Right? Right! Just check my feedback to hear from over 688 responses on more than 720 sales and/or purchases while carrying a 100% feedback rating. Astounding! I have been on Ebay for 18 years. Yes, you can trust me alright. I only ship to your PayPal confirmed address, and will sell to you if your address is within the contiguous continental United States (not including Alaska, Hawaii, or any Island territories.) I thank you for reading through this listing. Have a wonderful day!", "ItemID": "113680067496", "EndTime": "2019-03-19T22:31:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-09T22:31:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Oakley-X-Metal-Romeo-Gen-1-Sunglasses-Circa-1998-Original-lenses-and-Case-/113680067496", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Manchester Center, Vermont", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136800674968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTcwWDEyMDA=/z/QhMAAOSw1lxchDT~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTIxWDEyMDA=/z/3QwAAOSwAMZchDUG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDM2WDEyMDA=/z/RkEAAOSwpCFchDUK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQ3WDEyMDA=/z/NxQAAOSwWR5chDUP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDg4WDEyMDA=/z/hnkAAOSwF8BchDUV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk1WDEyMDA=/z/HZQAAOSwHF5chDUc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk1WDEyMDA=/z/ZZcAAOSwyQJchDUh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzAyWDEyMDA=/z/agoAAOSwnI9chDUm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgwWDEyMDA=/z/Uh4AAOSwC8ZchDUu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjM5WDEyMDA=/z/gYgAAOSw-sNchDUz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjMzWDEyMDA=/z/U78AAOSw~SJchDU4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTUzWDEyMDA=/z/ocwAAOSwCCpchDU8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "05255", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "markstar42", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 658, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 20, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 531.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 531.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***w", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 90}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Oakley X Metal Romeo Gen 1 Sunglasses Circa 1998 with Original lenses and Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Oakley"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Oakley Romeo 1"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["Gray"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["Gray"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Metal"]}, {"Name": "Temple Length", "Value": ["132 mm"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "California Prop 65 Warning", "Value": ["Unknown"]}]}, "HitCount": 937, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 541.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Original Romeo Gen 1 Sunglasses with Original X Metal lenses.
