Opportunity Village?s MISSION: Opportunity Village is a not-for-profit organization serving adults in the Southern Nevada community with intellectual and related disabilities, to enhance their lives and the lives of the families who love them. Opportunity Village is dedicated to helping people become the very best they can be. Through vocational training, community employment, day services, advocacy, arts and social recreation, citizens with severe disabilities are able to find new friends, realize future career paths, seek independence and community integration and unleash creative passions. Because of Your Support! Almost entirely self-funded, Opportunity Village is possible because supporters realize the value in supporting their neighbors with intellectual disabilities. In our society, people with disabilities live their lives being told what they can't do. Opportunity Village strives to break that stigma, encouraging the people it serves to follow their dreams.", "ItemID": "264221527585", "EndTime": "2019-03-09T19:15:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-02T19:15:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Maui-Jim-Sport-Hookipa-Rimless-Polarized-Sunglasses-w-Case-/264221527585", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2642215275858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQzWDE2MDA=/z/hSEAAOSwK2JcetSj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTU4WDE2MDA=/z/~P4AAOSwjyBcetSk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkwWDE2MDA=/z/rJQAAOSwRYNcetSl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDk5WDE2MDA=/z/8ZIAAOSw~LpcetSn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzAyWDE2MDA=/z/inQAAOSwUDZcetSo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0N1gxNjAw/z/QdcAAOSwuTRcetSq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "89107", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "opportunityvillage_1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 926, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.3, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 357}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Maui Jim Sport Ho'okipa Rimless Polarized Sunglasses w/Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Maui Jim"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Polarized"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Sport"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Plastic"]}]}, "HitCount": 268, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Charity": {"CharityID": "139388", "CharityName": "Opportunity Village", "CharityNumber": 2003261, "DonationPercent": 100.0, "Mission": "Opportunity Village is a nonprofit organization that serves people with significant intellectual disabilities, to improve their lives and the lives of their families.", "LogoURL": "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjcxWDEzNDA=/z/tOYAAOSw7m9bK2mz/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "Status": "Valid"}, "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1756252435", "StoreName": "OVShop"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 105.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good.
