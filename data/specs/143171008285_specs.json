{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "More of the good stuff for bids tonight. This is a vintage pair of B&L Ray Ban LEATHERS which are the last word in sunglass luxury. You have the well known 24K gold plated Aviator frame, but this time covered in rich bridle leather. Even the paddles are covered in the same leather which makes them easy on the ears. And this is a rare Burgundy / Red color for the Leathers Series. Very hard to come by if you are a fan of the Leathers. Hallmarking on the glasses includes the B&L logo etch on each lens and the white Ray Ban script logo on the right lens.. Markings on the frame include \"B&L RAY-BAN U.S.A.\" on the top of the cross bar (under the leather) and \"B&L RAY-BAN 58[]14\" on the underside. Both nose pads also have the B&L logo stamp in the center metal supports. The nose pads are the factory original soft silicone with greater surface area for a more comfortable fit. Think extended wear on those long Summer trips. The condition of these vintage stunners is excellent to near mint both lenses and frames. The lenses are completely free of nicks, pits, chips and scuffs. However, there are a couple of short, light scratches at the bottom of each lens. To paraphrase a line from an old movie, if you have to have scratches, that's the best place for them to be. A minor cosmetic issue. The metal frames are super bright and shiny with no corrosion, dings or damage to the 24K gold plate. The leather covered parts of the frame have very little wear. Just a couple places with micro-nicks. You usually look at the paddles to get an idea of how much a pair of Leathers has been worn as the paddles are the part (other than the nose pads) of the frame in closest contact with skin. And usually the leather darkens from absorbed oils and moisture. These paddles show none of that. Once again a micro-nick or two, but otherwise they look good. The plastic parts of the frame, the nose pads, show no age deterioration or damage at all. The glasses come with a B&L Ray Ban Aviator hard case which is not the original Leathers case, but it is a very fine case otherwise with the 1970's textured finish. Shipping and handling is $10.00 anywhere in the continental USA. Shipping is by USPS Priority Mail with tracking. International shipping is also by USPS Priority Mail with tracking at a flat worldwide cost of $40.00 USD. No shipping to either Germany or Italy, however.
