{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "More Changeable B&L Ray Ban Smart Lens Tech for bids tonight. Here are another pair of the very functional Changeables in the 58mm Aviator Outdoorsman frame in near MINT condition no less. Decades before there were smart phones, there were Smart lenses. The Changeable Browns being one of the better known examples of a larger group of Smart lenses known as \"The Changeables.\" The Ambermatic is perhaps the best known example. Like the Ambermatic, the Changeable Brown gives you some extra versatility. You can use it as a sunglass lens to enhance your driving experience and with cable temples, the security of fit for that mountain hike to the top of Kilimanjaro or wind surfing the tropical waters of some exotic locale. Hallmarking on the glasses includes the B&L logo etch on each lens and the white Ray Ban script logo on the right lens. Markings on the frame include \"B&L RAY-BAN U.S.A.\" on the top of the cross bar and \"B&L RAY-BAN 58[]14\" on the underside. And both nose pads also have the B&L logo stamp in the center metal support. The nose pads and brow bar are a matching mother of pearl color for an extra nice touch. The condition of these vintage stunners is near MINT both lenses and frames. The lenses are completely free of any and all scratches, nicks, pits, chips and scuffs. The metal frames are super bright and shiny with no corrosion or damage to the 24K gold plate, but one ding on the cross bar that I can find. Very minor. All 4 screw heads are perfect with no deformation or damage from tightening. The plastic parts of the frame, the brow bar and nose pads, show no age deterioration or damage of any kind. So very nearly MINT or NEW and just a little short of the goal. The glasses come with their equally nice B&L Ray Ban Aviator hard case. Shipping and handling is $10.00 anywhere in the continental USA. Shipping is by USPS Priority Mail with tracking. International shipping is by USPS Priority mail at a flat cost of $40.00 USD. No shipping to Germany or Italy.
