{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage Porsche Design By Carrera Aviator 5623 Sunglasses, Sorry, No Extra Lens (lost them somehow). Condition is Pre-owned. Case shows signs of normal wear. Nose pads show use and can be replaced if you decide to. Lens have marks where the ear pieces rubbed on the inside (see photos, I have tape pointers pointing at them, photos make the marks look worse than they actually are) but are not in the line of vision, would be best to get replacement lens. Otherwise, they just have minimal surface scratches. Remember they are vintage from the 80\u2019s. Comes with OEM case. The frames can be adjusted if needed and are in good condition. There is also some oxidation of the metal on the inside (black paint worn) from use, does not affect the look from the outside. I got these back in the late 80's when I was a Porsche/Audi service tech, they were expensive, well used and loved. Contact me and make an offer. They do have serial number but it\u2019s hard to photograph, Thanks for your interest and check out my other auctions for nothing but cool stuff.", "ItemID": "273751566703", "EndTime": "2019-03-15T17:26:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-08T17:26:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Porsche-Design-Carrera-Aviator-5623-90-Sunglasses-Athentic-80s-Audi-/273751566703", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Harrisburg, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2737515667038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q~8AAOSwCR9cgqAX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mV8AAOSwrMhcgqAx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YA8AAOSw7IRcgqBH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7NkAAOSwpclcgqBk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5vkAAOSwe0tcgqCP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nhYAAOSwsl5cgqDG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "28075", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "quattrostar", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 962, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 51.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 51.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 187}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Porsche Design By Carrera Aviator 5623 90 Sunglasses,Athentic 80's Audi ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Porsche Design"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Metal"]}, {"Name": "Temple Length", "Value": ["135 mm"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Aviator"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Austria"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Polarized"]}, {"Name": "Theme", "Value": ["80's Sunglasses"]}]}, "HitCount": 208, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 52.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used and well loved", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
