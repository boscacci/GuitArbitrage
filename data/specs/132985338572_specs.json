{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "More vintage B&L Ray Ban treasure for bids tonight. Here are a pair of the very rare Changeable Rose in the 58mm Aviator Outdoorsman frame in near MINT condition without any obvious wear. Decades before there were smart phones, there were smart lenses. The Changeable Rose being one of the more exotic and rare examples of a larger group of lenses known as \"The Changeables.\" The Ambermatic being the best known example of the Changeables. Always hard to find and always in demand, the Changeable Rose lens is one of the more stunning Changeable colors and most definitely one of the rarer. In combination with the Outdoorsman frame, almost impossible to find. Not merely sunglass lenses, these smart lenses self-adjust to such an extent, that you need not take them off even when indoors. Hallmarking on the glasses includes the B&L logo etch on each lens, but not the white Ray Ban script logo at the top of the right lens. Markings on the frame include \"B&L RAY-BAN U.S.A.\" on the top of the cross bar and \"B&L RAY-BAN 58[]14\" on the underside. And both nose pads also have the B&L logo stamp in the center metal support. The condition of these vintage stunners is near MINT both lenses and frames. The lenses are completely free of any and all nicks, pits, chips and scuffs, but there is one very small, very light scratch off center on the right lens. On the left lens, there are a couple of very small, very light dots that I wouldn't call pits. As for the frames, they are super bright and shiny with no dings, tool marks, scratches or scuffs. Just a couple places where a very light corrosion dot or two is visible. All 4 screw heads are excellent with only light deformation or damage from tightening. The plastic parts of the frame, the brow bar and nose pads, show no age deterioration or damage of any kind. All in all these light signs of wear on either the frame or lenses do not represent much of a cosmetic or functional issue. Just keep the glasses from being called MINT or NEW. The glasses come with their equally excellent B&L Ray Ban Aviator hard case and it is the correct 58mm size.. Shipping and handling is $10.00 anywhere in the continental USA. Shipping is by USPS Priority Mail with tracking. International shipping is also by USPS Priority mail at a flat cost of $40.00 USD worldwide. No shipping to either Germany or Italy. Thanks as always for bidding and more importantly, for winning!", "ItemID": "132985338572", "EndTime": "2019-03-19T01:50:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-12T01:50:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-B-L-Ray-Ban-Changeable-Rose-Aviator-Outdoorsman-58mm-Nr-MINT-Cables-Temp-/132985338572", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cotulla, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329853385728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q3kAAOSwf-BchwtO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HeMAAOSwCA5chwtT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aMkAAOSwu2tchwtX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AOMAAOSw9Ztchwtc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "78014", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "treasure-one", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4095, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.6}, "BidCount": 40, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 241.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 241.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 539}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage B&L Ray Ban Changeable Rose Aviator Outdoorsman 58mm Nr MINT Cables Temp", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["B&L Ray Ban"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["Rose / Pink"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Aviator"]}, {"Name": "Protection", "Value": ["All You Could Possibly Ask For"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["24K Arista Gold"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Metal & Plastic"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Changeable Rose (Smart Lens)"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Temple Length", "Value": ["6.25 Inches (Medium Length)"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Lens Size", "Value": ["58mm"]}, {"Name": "Frame Width", "Value": ["5.375 Inches (Medium / Large)"]}, {"Name": "Temple Type", "Value": ["Cable"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Outdoorsman"]}, {"Name": "Lens Material", "Value": ["Crown / Optical Glass"]}]}, "HitCount": 390, "Subtitle": "Smart Lens Technology - Ultra Rare Changeable Rose Lens", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=6376641", "StoreName": "The Sunglass Empire"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 244.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Near MINT Frames (just a couple very tiny corrosion dots on cross bar hidden from view) and Near MINT lenses (one tiny very light scratch on right lens and a couple very tiny, very light dots on left lens.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
