LENS: Hard To Find Original Oakley Blue Iridium lenses have a VR28 Base and they are in Excellent pre-owned condition, There is no peeling or flaking of the AR coating or iridium anywhere. I have tried to take pictures of any flaws, They are so small that most won't show up in the magnified pictures. There may be some very minor micro-marks on them as s typical for these delicate vintage iridium lens coatings that have been handled, cleaned or seen minimal use. They are visible under magnification and at the right angle. I can't see them while wearing them, but this may also depend on your sensitivity. Overall these are in really nice shape! Blue Iridium: Utilizes a contrast-enhancing VR28 lens tint with an Iridium\u00ae coating to further tune contrast and reduce glare Light Transmission: 15% Conditions: Medium to bright light with contrast enhancing bias Protection Index: 3 These are great for Fishing, Golf, Cycling, Driving or Baseball etc...
