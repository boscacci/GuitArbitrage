{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here are another pair of the original 1930's Rounds in the B&L 1/10 12K GF frame. This particular version is known as the BERWYN with its intricate pattern cross bar. The frame has a striking diamond pattern filigree on the lens holders, cross bar and temples. The lenses are Shade #3 Ray Ban Glass, the very material for which the Ray Ban Company was named. The width of the frames is 4.625 inches which was a medium / large size for the era. Check this size against a pair of glasses or sunglasses you already own to make sure they will fit you. Most people buy these as collector's pieces, but some do wear them. And finally, the temples are the cable type for the securest of fit. Hallmarking on the glasses includes \"B&L 1/10 12K GF FUL-VUE\" on the inside of the cross bar. \"FUL-VUE\" means the hinge blocks are attached higher on the frame for better peripheral vision. Both temples are also marked \"B&L 1/10 12K GF\" in a circular pattern around each screw hole (you have to remove the temple to see this). Both nitro cellulose nose pads have the B&L logo in raised letters on the reverse of each pad. And finally, GF does in fact mean Gold Filled, but this is somewhat of a misnomer because the gold is on the surface of the frame rather the core and the frames are only 5% pure gold (10% gold when including the metal alloy (silver, platinum, rhodium or copper) by weight sans the lenses, nose pads and screws. The condition of these vintage stunners is choice MINT. The frames are super bright and shiny and have no scratches, nicks, dings or damage to the finish. Both hinge blocks are free from those pesky tool marks. All 4 screw heads show no wear or damage from tightening. Both lenses are free from scratches, nicks, pits, chips or scuffs. Both nose pads have no age deterioration, cracking or fading. The glasses come with their original steel clamshell hard case which is seen in the last picture. The case in the first picture is for display purposes only. Shipping and handling is $10.00 anywhere in the continental USA. Shipping is by USPS Priority Mail with tracking. International shipping is also by USPS Priority Mail with tracking at a flat rate of $40.00 USD worldwide. NO shipping to Germany or Italy.
