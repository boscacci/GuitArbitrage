{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "More fantastic vintage treasure for your ultimate bidding pleasure. Offered tonight is an original pair of B&L 1/10 12K GF Ray Ban Aviator Shooters from the 1940's. But these are no ordinary WWII era Shooters. These are a special version called \"The Champions\" and were made only from 1937 to 1945. They have the heavier, thicker gauge temples with the corniced outsides and the highly coveted ARCO marking on the insides. But with Shade #3 Ray Ban Glass lenses rather than the far more common kalichrome C lenses. These are the holy grail of vintage B&L Ray Ban Shooters. The Champions also feature the highly figured and extremely rare nitro cellulose brow bar and nose pads. And finally, the glasses come with their own distinctive steel clamshell hard case with wool liner. And most interesting of all, these glasses while not officially new, do have the original gold, tin foil, hang tag, the first hang tag used on B&L Ray Ban sunglasses. Hallmarking on the glasses includes \"B&L 1/10 12K GF\" stamped into the top of the cross bar. Both temples are also stamped \"B&L 1/10 12K GF\" on the inside of each temple stem and also marked \"ARCO\" on the inside of each temple stem. The reverse of each nose pad also has the B&L marking in raised letters. Hallmarking on the lenses would have to wait another 30 to 35 years to appear on any model of the Aviator or Shooter. And, the \"GF\" marking does in fact mean \"Gold Filled,\" but this is something of a misnomer as the gold is on the surface of the frame rather than the core and is only 10% 12K gold alloy by weight or 5% 24K pure gold by weight sans the lenses, plastic and screws. The condition of these vintage WWII Champion Shooters is used, but for all practical purposes NEW. The frames are that shiny and bright, the plastic that silky and smooth and the lenses that flawless. Even the hinge blocks have only the lightest of tool marks. The screw heads have no appreciable wear. The lenses are totally free of any and all scratches, chips, nicks, pits and scuffs. The plastic parts of the frame, the nitro cellulose nose pads and brow bar, show no age damage, cracking, fading or hazing at all. The original steel clamshell case is in excellent condition as well with the metal exterior and felt interior perfectly intact. Shipping and handling is $10.00 anywhere in the continental USA. Shipping is by USPS Priority Mail with tracking. International shipping is also by USPS Priority Mail with tracking at a flat rate of $40.00, but no deliveries to Germany or Italy due to postal / customs service issues. Thanks as always for bidding and more importantly, for winning!", "ItemID": "143161819702", "EndTime": "2019-03-14T04:10:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-07T04:10:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-B-L-1-10-12K-GF-Ray-Ban-Aviator-Shooter-62mm-Champions-Steel-Clamshell-/143161819702", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cotulla, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431618197028080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DwkAAOSw1~NcgJQ0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RLUAAOSw6hBcgJQ5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2z4AAOSwizpcgJQ~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mR8AAOSwWdFcgJRF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "78014", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "treasure-one", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4095, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.6}, "BidCount": 41, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 748.54, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 748.54, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***f", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1140}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage B&L 1/10 12K GF Ray Ban Aviator Shooter 62mm Champions Steel Clamshell", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["B&L Ray Ban"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["True Green"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Aviator"]}, {"Name": "Protection", "Value": ["All You Could Possibly Ask For"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["12K Gold"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Metal & Plastic"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Shade #3 Ray Ban Glass (RB-3)"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Temple Length", "Value": ["6.25 Inches (Medium Length)"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Temple Type", "Value": ["Cable w/ Corniced Edges"]}, {"Name": "Frame Width (Hinge to Hinge)", "Value": ["5.375 Inches"]}, {"Name": "DBL (Distance Between Lenses)", "Value": ["16mm"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Shooter (Champions Version)"]}, {"Name": "Frame / Lens Size", "Value": ["62mm"]}, {"Name": "Lens Material", "Value": ["Crown / Optical Glass"]}]}, "HitCount": 465, "Subtitle": "ARCO Marked Champions - Shade #3 Ray Ban Glass Lenses!", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=6376641", "StoreName": "The Sunglass Empire"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 758.54, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "MINT Champions with Near MINT case and original gold foil hang tag.
