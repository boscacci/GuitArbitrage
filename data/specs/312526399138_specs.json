{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "*******LENS ARE PRESCRIPTION AND WILL NEED REPLACED******* In order to save time on listings so I can provide a wider selection for you, I have made up my own grading scale (below) for the condition of this item. I will do my best to rely more on my pictures to really tell you the true condition of my items. Remember these are pre-owned, none of my sunglasses / frames will be absolutely 100%, though some maybe really close to brand new condition. FRAME GRADE FOR THIS ITEM: A- (left arm could use a tightening) FRAME GRADE SCALE: (A): Like new, maybe a couple scratches you can only really tell with a magnify glass. (B): A few very light scratches/scuffs that aren't oh my gosh noticeable but are there. (C): Decent amount of scratches / scuffs that are pretty noticeable without being up close to a light. (D): Very noticeable scratches / scuffs with possibility of frames being bent. (F): Parts only pretty much. Lens are prescription so therefore will need replaced, therefore no grade for Lens will be provided. ALL MY SUNGLASSES / FRAMES ARE 100% AUTHENTIC. CHECK OUT MY FEEDBACK! NO CASE COMES WITH PURCHASE. I ship all glasses in a heavy duty 6x4x4 box with bubble wrap. If their is a number at the end of title don\u2019t pay attention to it. It\u2019s beneficial for me when it\u2019s time to ship out. I ONLY use eBay global shipping program for all international sales! Therefore please do not message me to send to a country out of the eBay global shipping program!! If you buy multiple please pay every week. I do combine shipping. If you only buy one please pay immediately and I will have them shipped out next business day! Sorry if I'm slow at replying to messages!!! I do accept returns!!! I want my customers happy!!! BE SURE TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER VINTAGE AND NEWER SHADES / FRAMES IN MY STORE! BE SURE TO CLICK THAT FOLLOW SO YOU DON\"T MISS OUT ON ANY DEALS!!!! THANKS FOR LOOKING!
