{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "These were one of my father's backup pairs (he had a \"backup\" pair in every vehicle, see other auctions). The ear socks are in good shape, however, the nose pieces are missing. The lenses are the original Oakley lenses (non-polarized) and have a decent number of scratches and are cracking a bit. I would strongly recommend changing them. Unfortunately Oakley no longer makes the lenses for these (otherwise I wouldn't be selling) and only makes the ear socks and nose pieces for these glasses. There are 3rd parties that make an array of lenses for them that I've included links to below. The lenses are exchanged with a small star tool on the bottom of the glasses (careful there is a small screw and rubber o-ring). https://www.oakley.com/en-us/product/W20110091C?variant=700285064895 https://www.amazon.com/Ikon-Replacement-Lenses-Juliet-Sunglasses/dp/B017IUHA52 https://www.revantoptics.com/ https://www.fuselenses.com/ ***Note: These take different lenses than the Juliets, they are slightly bigger. Look for the X-metal XX lenses. On Mar-06-19 at 14:09:33 PST, seller added the following information: I have been told these are most likely Gen 4 xx metal not Gen 1. Sorry for the confusion.
