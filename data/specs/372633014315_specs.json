The 'Ray Ban' logo printed on the lens only appeared on later models from the 80's onwards, earlier examples with no lens logo printed are still genuine - From 1998 to present day Ray Bans have been made by a company called Luxottica in Italy, lenses inscribed with 'RB' By bidding on this auction, UK buyers agree to pay for postage if they choose to return the item.
