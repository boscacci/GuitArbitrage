{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Persol Steve McQueen Special Edition PO714SM 95/S3 Folding Polarised Sunglasses New PO 714 differs from the original version for a series of small but important details: - the return of the green lens \u2013 the favorite of Steve McQueen\u2122;\u2028- folding closure at the back end of the temple arm \u2013 no longer top to bottom, but now from outside to inside;\u2028- the Supreme Arrow, Persol\u2019s distinctive mark, is the functional element enclosing the hinges. Here, it is mounted both on the temple arm and front of the frame - as in the classic model - as well as on the folding hinge and middle of the temple arm, with a total of four arrows. This design choice clearly accentuates the identity of a model that is already iconic; Introduced in the 1960s, the 714 was a folding adaptation of the famous 649, and was perhaps the first-ever collapsible pair of glasses. Designed for comfort and convenience, the 714 was made famous by Steve McQueen who wore them both off screen and on screen, and they are still among the most popular and fashionable sunglasses today. Taking only eight days to create something beautiful, Persol is obsessive about its handcrafted eyewear. Combine style and functionality and you've got one sleek package. Since 1910, Persol has created unique glasses from the highest caliber materials. Almost a century later, Persol remains dedicated to stylish, comfortable glasses of the utmost quality. \u00a0 Sold without the original case. Black Microfiber pouch included.
