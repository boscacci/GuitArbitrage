Do not consider glasses as flawless, they are still pre-owned. I will consider only reasonable offers. You are responsible to do your own research/ try the size of the glasses. These are a used pair of sunglasses meaning they might be previously worn and be a tiny bit stretched or adjusted for a certain person. The good news that most of them are plastic frame and the adjustment takes only a couple of mins for an optician. I would recommend stopping by an optical store that sells sunglasses and ask them to adjust it, usually, they take a few bucks for or something nothing at all. Sunglasses are always a personal item and need to be adjusted for everybody. I will not accept a return based on it is not for your face. Kindly note that I'm describing the glasses how I see that. Lighting, vision, the line of sight and sensitivity to scratches are subjective. The main point of the description is to give you an idea of the condition, even with the pics attached to see how it looks and where it is located and then you need to decide if it works for you. ( some of the people are very sensitive, some of them not even bothered by deep scratch).

Make sure you have correct shipping address before purchase, I will not ship to any other address, except the one indicated in the order. Please contact me if you have any questions before purchasing for more details. Iridium Lenses:Oakley Iridium lens coating is engineered to reduce glare and improve contrast. An array of available tints allows the wearer to balance light transmission in any light condition. The 12-micron jacket of Iridium must be treated with special care to avoid scratching. It is only recommended to use an Oakley Micro Bag or Oakley Lens Cleaning Kit to clean Oakley lens, do not use any other solvents, chemicals or third party cleaning kits because they have not been tested on our lenses and can possibly damage them. 2.96", "ItemID": "264038395067", "EndTime": "2019-03-29T16:56:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-13T19:44:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Oakley-OO9181-23-RADARLOCK-PATH-VENTED-Black-Ink-w-Black-Iridium-AUTHENTIC-/264038395067", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Hollywood, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640383950678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QDsAAOSwoxpb6yl5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KRgAAOSwwtdb6ylx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/p1AAAOSwBVdb6yl6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ce0AAOSwDEBb6yl1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ThcAAOSwlelb6yly/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qYkAAOSwyodb6yl4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gbwAAOSwTc5b6ylu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QIgAAOSwq6Nb6yl2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/grEAAOSwOVlb6yl0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gbEAAOSwtmNb6yl7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/A~MAAOSwVFJb6ylw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33021", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eye-conic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1711, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 89.1, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 89.1, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***4", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 19}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Oakley OO9181-23 RADARLOCK PATH VENTED Black Ink w/ Black Iridium AUTHENTIC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Oakley"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Plastic"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["black Iridium"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Mirrored"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Shield"]}, {"Name": "Protection", "Value": ["100% UVA & UVB"]}, {"Name": "Temple Length", "Value": ["131 mm"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["Matte black ink"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 379, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1556690139", "StoreName": "Eye-conic"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Like new shape!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "SKU": "2.96", "NewBestOffer": false}
