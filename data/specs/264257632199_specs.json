{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Pre-owned pair of Authentic Ray Ban sunglasses. Great shape, excellent condition. The glasses look very nice and pretty clean, seems that the glasses were barely worn. It might have just a couple of minor imperfections from normal wear that I do not find it noticeable at all when glasses are on and nothing obstructs the view. The frame is in great shape! Except for the deep lens crack at the left side of the left lens. Please see pictures for better understanding the condition of the glasses. Very stylish sunglasses made with the top quality of the brand! Folding technology allow you to hold them in your pocket, very convenient! Polarized lenses drastically reduce the brightness of shiny surfaces, like chrome, and large bodies of water. Polar lenses reduce reflections and enhance contrast. improving visual clarity and reducing eye strain. Comes with the authentic Ray Ban case only.

Do not consider glasses as flawless, they are still pre-owned. I will consider only reasonable offers. You are responsible to do your own research/ try the size of the glasses. These are a used pair of sunglasses meaning they might be previously worn and be a tiny bit stretched or adjusted for a certain person. The good news that most of them are plastic frame and the adjustment takes only a couple of mins for an optician. I would recommend stopping by an optical store that sells sunglasses and ask them to adjust it, usually, they take a few bucks for or something nothing at all. Sunglasses are always a personal item and need to be adjusted for everybody. I will not accept a return based on it is not for your face. Kindly note that I'm describing the glasses how I see that. Lighting, vision, the line of sight and sensitivity to scratches are subjective. The main point of the description is to give you an idea of the condition, even with the pics attached to see how it looks and where it is located and then you need to decide if it works for you. ( some of the people are very sensitive, some of them not even bothered by deep scratch).

Make sure you have correct shipping address before purchase, I will not ship to any other address, except the one indicated in the order.
