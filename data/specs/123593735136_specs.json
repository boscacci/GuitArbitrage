{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "These are the actual Matte with brown (looks light brown but is dark when you where them). Yes, the actual ones which are hard to find. I see a lot of people selling the glossy version of this as if it were this one but I shake my head when I see those ones pop up. These go for upwards of $130 but these were very gently used so I cannot say that they are new but they are in very good condition. Take a look at the pictures for a full description on what you are getting and definitely pick the right ones. Yes these are the right ones which I had my brother send me several pair of while he worked at Oakley in Irvine, CA. Don't worry, I'm keeping a few of them. I just don't need 4 pairs. Good luck and hope you have a wonderful day! I do not have the original box for this one but it does come with the sleeve.", "ItemID": "123593735136", "EndTime": "2019-03-30T20:50:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T05:07:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Oakley-Mens-Sunglasses-Two-Face-Polarized-OO9189-26-Matte-Black-Dark-Brown-Lns-/123593735136", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235937351368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/JC0AAOSwfvtcPBae/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/xIMAAOSws6dcPBbV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/wScAAOSwmMNcPBbc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zuIAAOSwfplcPBbk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/88IAAOSwgrZcPBbr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80918", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "andrewusa1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 52, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 79.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 79.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 55}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Oakley Men's Sunglasses Two Face Polarized OO9189-26 Matte Black/ Dark Brown Lns", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Oakley"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Plastic"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["Prizm"]}, {"Name": "Gender", "Value": ["Men"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Polarized"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Sport"]}, {"Name": "Temple Length", "Value": ["137 mm"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["oo9189-26"]}]}, "HitCount": 487, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
