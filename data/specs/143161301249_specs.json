{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "These were one of my father's backup pairs (he had a \"backup\" pair in every vehicle, see other auctions). The ear socks and nose pieces are in good shape. The lenses are the original Oakley lenses (non-polarized) and have a decent number of scratches and are cracking a bit. I would strongly recommend changing them. Unfortunately Oakley no longer makes the lenses for these (otherwise I wouldn't be selling) and only makes the ear socks and nose pieces for these glasses. There are 3rd parties that make an array of lenses for them that I've included links to below. The lenses are exchanged with a small star tool on the bottom of the glasses (careful there is a small screw and rubber o-ring).On Mar-06-19 at 12:28:31 PST, seller added the following information: https://www.oakley.com/en-us/product/W20110091C?variant=700285064895https://www.amazon.com/Ikon-Replacement-Lenses-Juliet-Sunglasses/dp/B017IUHA52https://www.revantoptics.com/https://www.fuselenses.com/On Mar-06-19 at 14:11:23 PST, seller added the following information: This does NOT include the Oakley glasses bag", "ItemID": "143161301249", "EndTime": "2019-03-13T20:00:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-06T20:00:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Oakley-X-Metal-polished-frame-Juliet-Sunglasses-hammer-stems-/143161301249", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Port Hueneme, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431613012498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc5WDg4MQ==/z/cQMAAOSwsq1cgCZQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDExWDExODk=/z/cSkAAOSwZ65cgCZx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTcxWDEwMjM=/z/7msAAOSwIz5cgCZ8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SIEAAOSwxNBcgCaO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "93041", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cdeyle", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 405, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 28, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 238.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 238.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 29}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Oakley X-Metal polished frame Juliet Sunglasses, hammer stems", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Oakley"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Metal"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Oakley Juliet"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["Multi-Color"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Mirrored"]}]}, "HitCount": 533, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 241.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
