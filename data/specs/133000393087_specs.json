{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Maui Jim STINGRAY Sunglasses MJ-103-02 Gloss Black Frames Neutral Grey Polarized These Maui Jim Stingray Sunglasses are as good as new. They have ZERO scratches on the lens and frames. Received them as a gift and wore them a couple of times and realized they were a little too big for me. They have been back in the box ever since. Guaranteed authentic and comes with the original box, plastic wrap the glasses were packed in, the paperwork, as well as the hard brown protective Maui Jim case and cloth clean cloth/bag. Once you own a pair of polarized Maui Jim sunglasses you will never by anything else. I am actually going to buy and another pair just smaller. Glasses come from a smoke-free, pet-free, child-free home.Check out my perfect ratings.... Thanks for viewing...
