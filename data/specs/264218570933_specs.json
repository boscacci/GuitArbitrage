{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here we have the ultimate piece for persol collectors, the extremely iconic 69218 model. This was worn by many celebrities in the 80s, including Don Johnson in Miami Vice. These are the even rarer white model, which is very, very hard to find. These really don't come up too often. There's some on ebay at the moment for $10,000 and some more reasonably priced at \u00a3900 They come with the original case, which is beautiful. Also they have the original engraved brown crystal lense, which works very well with the white. Condition is excellent, structurally they're great and there's no blemishes that I can see on the front side. On the back there is some yellowing (which is to be expected with 30+ years of wear). There is some small scratches on the crystal lense, but they don't affect visibility at all. All in all these are a very very good 8/10. They are engraved with '69218' near the model number on the inside, as the older models should be. This is a rare chance to grab these, go for it! They're too big for me, so I'm deciding to sell! Otherwise they would be a great piece to keep for my collection. A true investment piece Feel free to message me with offers higher than the starting price", "ItemID": "264218570933", "EndTime": "2019-03-07T21:05:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-28T21:05:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/vintage-80s-Persol-69218-Miami-Vice-ultra-rare-WHITE-sunglasses-vgc-original-cas-/264218570933", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "London", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2642185709338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njk1WDk2NA==/z/s4AAAOSwQKdceEsz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTUyWDEyODY=/z/orQAAOSw9nJceEtP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8RMAAOSw32lceEsI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kRIAAOSwhAJceEsM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sz4AAOSwQKdceEsS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nEgAAOSwsrBceEsV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HpEAAOSwb2hceEsY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QFgAAOSwzvtceEsc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "SE164BJ", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothes, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tomwebster2010", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 359, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 243.67, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 187.0, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 995}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "UK", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "vintage 80s Persol 69218 Miami Vice ultra rare WHITE sunglasses vgc original cas", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Persol"]}, {"Name": "Theme", "Value": ["80s"]}, {"Name": "Frame Colour", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 204, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "SecondaryCategoryID": "48559", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Clothes, Shoes & Accessories:Vintage Clothing & Accessories:Vintage Accessories:Sunglasses", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:175759:182059:48559", "Country": "GB", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 192.0, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Condition is fantastic, yellowing around the nose on the underside.
