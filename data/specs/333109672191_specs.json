{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "FOR SALE IS A PAIR OF PRE OWNED OAKLEY SPLICE SUNGLASSES WITH YELLOWISH BLUE LENSES BEING SOLD AS-IS. THE GLASSES ARE IN GOOD SHAPE WITH SOME SIGNS OF WEAR ON THE RUBBER EAR PIECES AND ON THE FRAMES BUT OTHER THAN THAT THEY LOOK TO BE IN NEXT TO NEW CONDITION. THE AUCTION IS FOR THE GLASSES ONLY AND DOES COME WITH A SOFT AFTERMARKET FABRIC CASE. I buy and sell items that catch my eye, if you are seeing this, I guess it caught your eye too (to me that means you have good taste too, lol) If you see that I have something listed incorrectly, or have more information on an item, please let me know Below are my standard disclosures Please note that there may be a small amount of dirt, or price tag residue (I know better than to clean anything vintage and leave that option available to its next owner) If the item is new, the above wouldn't generally apply. Feel free to ask your questions or for additional photos Pics are of the actual item What you see is what you get (and no you cant have my measuring stick / tape, or display stand lol) If the item is a board game: Please judge for yourself if all the Pieces and Parts are there, I try my best to lay them out to where you can see everything in the photos. I ship my board games to you in the original box, wrapped in bubble wrap and then wrapped again in brown shipping paper. I ship most items that come with original box, in their original box, wrapped in bubble wrap and then wrapped again in brown shipping paper. If you purchase a New Unopened Item, and you choose to open it, and break it, that is not my fault and I will not offer you a refund (Yeah that happened). Nothing comes with batteries, unless specified. If the item comes with a, or multiple,light bulbs, those are not guaranteed to work. Check out my other auctions for more items - (If you are buying something, odds are I will make you a great deal on another item, as long as they can be shipped together) I am not a company, I am just one person (although I have had someone help me here and there) I usually ship on the saturday following my auctions end, however during the holidays and if the need arises, I can go more often. Payment is due within 48 hours or my eBay is set to automatically file an unpaid item claim to recoup my eBay costs, and the item will be relisted for sale If you buy multiple items and I can ship in one box, I will work with you on shipping costs While my return policy is 14 days, I am no longer willing to refund you for temporary blindness (not looking at the pictures) or temporary illiteracy (not reading the description). If for any reason you feel like you did not receive 5-star service, please E-MAIL ME before leaving ME your feedback, so I can make it right.", "ItemID": "333109672191", "EndTime": "2019-03-09T19:39:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-09T18:34:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Oakley-Splice-Sunglasses-/333109672191", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hales Corners, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3331096721918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GDwAAOSwPlpchAMd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NLgAAOSwtx1chAMm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NFAAAOSw~7JchAMf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XUEAAOSwj1VchAMh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QXoAAOSwPM9chAMp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Bw0AAOSw4EJchAMk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X0MAAOSwBlRchAMg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n8wAAOSwk1hchAMn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yUIAAOSwJBhchAMi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/n~oAAOSwDuRchAMs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Pd4AAOSwTgJchAMq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L9sAAOSwXIRchANE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53130", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thriftysellerz", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 106, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 69.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 69.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 826}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Oakley Splice Sunglasses ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Oakley"]}]}, "HitCount": 19, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 70.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
