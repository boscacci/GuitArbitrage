Regarding Vintage Ray Bans: - From 1937 to 1998 Ray Bans were made by an optics company called Bausch and Lomb in USA and France, hence the 'BL' engraving on vintage lenses. The 'Ray Ban' logo printed on the lens only appeared on later models from the 80's onwards, earlier examples with no lens logo printed are still genuine - From 1998 to present day Ray Bans have been made by a company called Luxottica in Italy, lenses inscribed with 'RB' By bidding on this auction, UK buyers agree to pay for postage if they choose to return the item.
