{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "BuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "Description": "For sale is an outstanding example of a gold plated double gradient mirror Outdoorsman Aviator sunglasses. I\u2019ve read the mirror finish split above and below in this manner was to reduce glare from both sunlight from above and below the wearer. Below meaning from water / snow reflecting sunlight effect.I know very little over all about them except what I\u2019ve read and from the gentleman I purchased them from. They were made in the late 60s. They are pre-B&L-etching era and that dates them before the 70s. Size: 58 14MM Medium Lens The ORIGINAL case has a hard plastic core keeping the sunglasses safe from bending or superficial harm. This is a SOLID pair of vintage sunglasses and you will not find them at a better chance to grab them. Hinges and frames are in great working order.I paid OVER $300 for them but you have a chance to win them by bid for much less!! I will start the auction at far below their actual value meaning someone could get them for a STEAL! Don\u2019t miss out on these! They will not be offered again... LOOK OVER THE PHOTOS WELL AND NOTE ITS VINTAGE CONDITION. I DONT EXCEPT RETURNS BUT THESE ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY PAIR WITH ONLY MINUTE BLEMISHES TO THE LENSES. IMO HARDLY NOTICEABLE TO BOTH WEARER OR FROM THE FRONT. I will ship them the same day I receive your payment. Thanks for looking and good luck to you.", "ItemID": "223460854082", "BuyItNowAvailable": true, "ConvertedBuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "EndTime": "2019-03-31T00:25:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-26T00:25:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1960s-vintage-B-L-Ray-Ban-Double-Gradient-Mirror-Outdoorsman-Aviator-Sunglasses-/223460854082", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Dallas, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2234608540828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4PIAAOSwSOlcmW6C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L-gAAOSwz1RcmW67/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zUsAAOSwp01cmW7S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-XcAAOSw-6BcmW9f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YswAAOSwh6pcmW9D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xuEAAOSwwpVcmW87/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9kAAAOSw0nhcmW9V/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4pAAAOSwj4hcmW8t/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIxM1gxNjAw/z/YYwAAOSwCMRcmW7-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Q-oAAOSwe0tcmW8i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM0MFgxNjAw/z/wuIAAOSwqrVcmW8E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNlgxNjAw/z/bwEAAOSwfjBcmW8H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "75229", "PrimaryCategoryID": "79720", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Clothing, Shoes & Accessories:Men's Accessories:Sunglasses & Sunglasses Accessories:Sunglasses", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "staxworx", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 122, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 82.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 82.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1960s vintage B&L Ray Ban Double Gradient Mirror Outdoorsman Aviator Sunglasses", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Double Gradient Mirror finish"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Outdoorsman Aviators"]}, {"Name": "Protection", "Value": ["UV"]}, {"Name": "Lens Technology", "Value": ["Gradient mirror UV glass lens"]}, {"Name": "Frame Material", "Value": ["Gold plated over metal alloy"]}, {"Name": "Lens Color", "Value": ["Gray"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ray-Ban"]}, {"Name": "Frame Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["58 14MM Medium Lens"]}]}, "HitCount": 266, "Subtitle": "Exceptional with original case", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "11450:4250:179239:79720", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 83.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Pre-owned", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good wearable condition.
