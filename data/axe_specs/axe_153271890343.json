DESCRIPTION=============The Fender Pawn Shop Jaguarillo Electric Guitar hot-rods traditional Jaguar design through the roof with a scorching HSS configuration in which all three pickups - two standard Stratocaster single-coils and an Atomic humbucking bridge pickup - are angled for enhanced bass and treble response. The Jaguar scale length permits the use of heavier gauge strings for a fuller sound while also still making string bends a breeze. Other unusual touches include a streamlined control layout (volume knob, tone knob and five-way blade pickup switch) and an Adjusto-Matic bridge with vintage-style floating tremolo tailpiece.
