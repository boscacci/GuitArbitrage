The vintage humbucker sound of the \u212259 is shrunk down to fit into any guitar with single-coil pickups. Mid - Duckbucker Using a patented design and a voicing based on Vintage Rails, Duckbuckers incorporate 6 fully adjustable pole pieces. True hum canceling construction with a unique, split blade design duplicates all the warm tone, cool output, and outrageous quack of a vintage Strat pickup. All quack, no hum. (The Duckbucker offers a great complementary tone when used in the neck and middle positions with a Little 59er at the bridge.) Bridge - Lil Screamin DemonLike its big brother, this little savage combines a big, open sound with just a subtle hint of glass in a direct replacement humbucker for single-coil guitars. It's a pickup that can scream and provide rich harmonics, but cleans up when backed off. The tone is big and percussive without being too harsh. Volume Knob has been upgraded to a CTS 500K Guitar has recently been professionally setup and plays extremely well. I hate to sell this one as it's one of my favorites but times are tough and gotta go. Very versatile for anything from jazz/blues/rock.
