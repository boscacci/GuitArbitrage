{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Genuine USA Made 2017 Les Paul Tribute. Factory Plek'd, 490R and 498T pickups. Plays like golden butter. I got this from Sweetwater in April 2017 - it has less than 5 hours playing time since then - still original strings. You can see them setting it up on the bench in one of the pictures. There is a tiny tiny scratch on the back of the neck and another on the body back as shown in pics. Also a small but strange dark coloration at the end of the fingerboard. Looks like a stain or just a dark spot on the rosewood. I put the genuine Gibson poker chip on because I think they look weird without them.This guitar has never left my non smoking home, no one's hands have touched it but mine since I got it. I have a ton of guitars and I'm mostly playing my PRS Custom 24 ten top these days, can you blame me? I don't think they are making this model anymore. The new Tributes are more expensive and they have dot inlays. I love this guitar but I have so many others so this will go. Comes with original gig bag. Will be shipped in its original Gibson box and all paperwork/accessories that came with it. I never even filled out the warranty card. Happy bidding and enjoy!", "ItemID": "163469916207", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T14:48:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T14:48:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Tribute-T-Satin-Gold-2017-Great-Condition-/163469916207", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Salisbury, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634699162078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/jjsAAOSwaaNcML-8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/eUYAAOSwv0dcML-Z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/6QwAAOSw6~pcML-b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/-VQAAOSwR3tcML-b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/htoAAOSwcOZcML-c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/ETEAAOSw7R9cML-e/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/-K0AAOSw~5dcML-c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/I1kAAOSwnWpcML-f/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/~YgAAOSwXgxcML-g/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/ERgAAOSwjoFcML-g/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rvwAAOSwUMBcML~i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/NZkAAOSwsDZcMMEs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "21801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "uab9253", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 359, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 752.52, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 752.52, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3787}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Tribute T  Satin Gold 2017 Great Condition!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Tribute"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["170100561"]}]}, "HitCount": 443, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 762.52, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
