{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "G&L BASS guitar L- 2000 Series E Vintage with Rare Slotted pickups!! Other than a few screws for the neck and bridge, control knobs and a new nut, this early version of the Leo Fender G&L L-2000 series E bass is ready to go. Some of the hardware such as screws and control knobs were heavily corroded and will be included along with everything else. One of the great things about this bass is that the MFD pickups are the slotted type and only produced on the earlier versions. As for the neck: the truss rod works fine and the neck appears fine, but there is one section that looks like one of the neck screws came through the fretboard that has been repaired, but it's barely noticeable. See the picture showing a close up of the fretboard--it's under the fret dot marker at fret number seventeen. I've had this for a number of years with the intention of restoring it, but I simply don't have the time anymore. I was going to have the bridge and control plate re-chromed because they are somewhat pitted, the body lightly sanded and re-lacquered, and a few other touches, but that's up to the new owner to decide at this point. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "264124966461", "EndTime": "2019-01-20T21:55:44.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-08T22:29:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1981-G-L-BASS-guitar-L-2000-Series-E-Rare-Slotted-pickups-/264124966461", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Maricopa, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641249664618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vhAAAOSw2bFcNRwP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pcgAAOSwe~lcNRwQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eVMAAOSwwPRcNRwQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ansAAOSwmy9cNRwQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Mj4AAOSwfMlcNRwO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rAAAAOSweI1cNRwO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bvYAAOSwNphcNRwO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D7IAAOSw8R9cNRwN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8tgAAOSwKOZcNRwO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hO4AAOSwxO9cNRwO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RzoAAOSwzgtcNRwP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s7MAAOSw1jpcNRwQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "85139", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ichikaba", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 693, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 749.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 749.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 851}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1981 G&L BASS guitar L- 2000 Series E with Rare Slotted pickups!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1981"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["4 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["L-2000E"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Clear"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 186, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
