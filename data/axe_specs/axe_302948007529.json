{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2004 PRS SE Soapbar in the Black Burst finish. Not a II and not a 245, this earliest of Paul Reed Smith SE Soapbar guitars features a single-cut one-piece solid mahogany body; a wide-fat set neck with moons on a 22 fret, rosewood fretboard; P90 pickups with one volume pot,one tone pot and pickup selector switch. This guitar has a less-than-perfect finish, apparently having led a working life, but there are no severe dings. The Korean-made control circuit as been replaced with Mojotone pots and an orange drop cap. Therefore, the pot shafts accept the US-sized knobs. When I got it, the guitar had replacement cream pickup covers and cream knobs. I replaced both with Mojotone black pickup covers and LP style speed knobs to restore the factory look. This guitar plays easily with proper action and a straight neck. The sound is great from the P90s through the Mojotone control circuit. This guitar is ready to rock out - if you are. It also sounds great clean. In addition, it comes with a really snazzy red gig bag. Send your questions and picture requests via email. United States Sales Only. I ship to the lower 48 only for $40.
