{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is Rare sea foam green American made Peavey Reactor AX Telecaster. This really is a great playing and great sounding guitar. Will ship in a guitar bag with heavy padding within a shipping box for safe shipping. These have become quite collectible, with the Reactor AX being a preferred model in terms of quality build and amazing tone. I actually spent my early 20s collecting reactors as I thought they were a hidden gem that I preferred to fender telecasters but I have been slowly getting rid of them over the years as I never play anymore. This is the last to go. Regrettably as it took me forever to find one. Product Specs (per Peavey): U.S. made in Meridian, Mississippi, the Reactor AX is a single cutaway, \"T-style\" alder body electric guitar sporting 2 \"Db2-T\" dual blade humbucker pickups (designed by, and made in-house at, Peavey), a bolt-on neck, a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard with dot inlays, strings-through fixed bridge, six-on-one-side tuners, pearloid pickguard.
