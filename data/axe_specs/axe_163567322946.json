This is the smallest fret size, neither as tall nor as wide as medium jumbo frets. This is how we used to make them back in the 50's, 60's and 70's, and is the comfortable way to go for those who grew up with it or simply just prefer the feel of smaller frets. Fingerboard: The fingerboard radius is an important spec that describes the amount of curvature across the width of the fingerboard. This instrument has a 7.25\" fingerboard radius, with a more pronounced \"vintage-style\" curvature typical of Fender guitars from the 50's, 60's and 70's.\u00a0This instrument features specially voiced American Vintage pickups meticulously researched and crafted to reproduce the authentic design, voice and performance of the great Fender guitars of the 1960s.\u00a0 Finish: This instrument includes a vintage-authentic nitrocellulose-lacquer finish that lets the body wood breathe with more natural resonance. It's Road Worn finish and hardware treatment imparts a cool aged look and feel, conveying the impression that this instrument has more than just a few miles. Scale: This is the classic shorter scale originally offered during the 1960s on Fender classics such as the Jaguar and Mustang guitars. Originally adopted to appeal to those already comfortable with the slightly shorter scales of guitars by other makers, the 24\" scale remains a classic Fender design element still offered today. Neck: The neck of this instrument has a comfortable \"C\" profile (the shape of the neck in cross section), sculpted to impart a vintage-style playing feel from Fender\u2019s first golden age in the 1950's and 60's. The most prevalent neck profile shape, it\u2019s remarkably comfortable and is ideal for all playing styles.", "ItemID": "163567322946", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T16:05:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-26T17:48:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Classic-60s-Jaguar-Nitrocellulose-Finish-Rosewood-Electric-Guitar-w-HSC-/163567322946", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Rayne, Louisiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635673229468080_4.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk4/z/94MAAOSwSsZcdhFr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NzY=/z/uiQAAOSwaEZcdYCp/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8sUAAOSwOyxcdYDE/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTI0/z/6roAAOSw8ihcdYC4/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDQ=/z/~ngAAOSwoMZcdYDg/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NTg=/z/gOAAAOSw8KRcdYCg/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4OTI=/z/ub4AAOSw9P1cdYDW/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NzI=/z/PC4AAOSwcwdcdYCv/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTc2WDE2MDA=/z/tR0AAOSwPaBcdZKB/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY4WDE2MDA=/z/fCsAAOSwb2hcdZCd/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk0WDE2MDA=/z/MbwAAOSw14FcdYCW/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjUy/z/7RgAAOSw2NhcdbI3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "70578", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "zuma1961", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 200, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.3}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 17}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Classic '60s Jaguar Nitrocellulose Finish Rosewood Electric Guitar w/HSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Rosewood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Jaguar"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 63, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "In excellent condition with beautiful Nitrocellulose Lacquer finish!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
