{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "EPIPHONE JAPAN Les Paul Standard LQ 2005 Cherryburst MIJ Fujigen Serial #: F500556 Wow! Have a look at this 2005 Les Paul Standard LQ! Cherryburst finish w/1ply cream pickguard. MADE IN JAPAN. 2005 Fujigen manufacture. Mahogany body w/maple top, mahogany neck, and Gibson type open book headstock! Serial number on the headstock back. It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few marks and scratches on it here and there Has some scratching on the body back from use other than that nothing that I found that I would call significantly major and overall I'd say that it's in fine shape Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the neck, body, and headstock are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard no problem with play. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Front and rear plastic pickup rings have thin cracks neither of which affect pickup stability or play in any way. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic! Loads of beefy attack, thick tone, and power! I found this one to be a great player! No gigbag. If this is what you're looking for don't miss it!
