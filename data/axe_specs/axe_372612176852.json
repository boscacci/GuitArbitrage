{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You get what you see in the pictures. Gibson Les Paul Supreme 100th Anniversary Guitar Case. Condition is Used, barely. Very small tear in handle and I've never seen any that has aluminum trim that lines up absolutely perfectly. The aluminum trim is a bit off on one corner of this case as pictured, although the tongue still fits in the channel. I haven't tried to give it a tweak... I just want it out of my sight. It's expensive to ship. If you send me a message agreeing to no returns I'll take 40 dollars off your price. This is what they shipped a guitar in that they sold for $6599.00 dollars, and I didn't like the case... so I immediately purchased a Gator Titan case and fell in love with that one. If this guitar case becomes a rare hard to find collectible I still wouldn't want one, because I hate it. The first brand new one the sent me had aluminum channel that was all bent out of whack, so they sent me this replacement that is in much better shape, although it still sucks. This is one of the better ones because it has minor imperfections in it. They went light on the thickness of the extruded material. If they went thicker it would have eliminated contraction and expansion or flex of the mold before they installed the aluminum channel, and it would have made assembly much less labor intensive. The whole case weigs only 9 pounds 11 ounces, so it's very lightweight for a hardshell case. Far from the worst thing in the world but it still sucks... what were they thinking? Star Trek enthusiast? The guitar is absolutely beautiful, but this case... it sucks. Only reason anyone would want one is because that's what they shipped the 2015 Gibson Supreme in and they didn't make many. Don't ask me to meet you in a public parking lot because I don't wanna be seen in public with this guitar case. Gibson les paul fits perfect in it. The mold is deeper than it appears in the photos. I don't know what ya see in it if you want it, but I think it's ugly. I'll ship anywhere within the continental United States only. No Islands or other Countries. Gibson Les Paul Supreme Guitar Case 2015... Ugly...!.
