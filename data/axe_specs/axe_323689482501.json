{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a 1983 Ibanez Roadstar II RS-315. Guitars of this model and quality are rarely available on eBay. I'm torn letting this go, but I purchased a much-coveted guitar and want to offset the cost. This guitar has been well cared for since purchase a few years ago. As seen in the pictures, only minor scratches/nicks are present on the flame maple body and there's a small dent (poly only) to the upper right of the pickup that's slightly noticeable. The maple neck is very smooth considering its usage and only minor pitting on the poly finish of the fretboard. No dents in the binding and the authentic quality is preserved (faux binding wasn't invented yet). No wiring shorts and the vintage V2 pickup still resonates as this Dimarzio prototype should. Original Sure Grip II knobs, Smooth Tuners and back plates are included, however the rubber portion on the tone knob is missing. Original \"V\" strap locks are solid. Frets are a tad worn as to be expected, but still good life left in them. No case. I'm very proud to be an owner of this great vintage axe from Japan and so will the person that wins this NO RESERVE auction. US bidders and Paypal only.
