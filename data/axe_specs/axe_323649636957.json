Beautiful Vintage 1980 Gibson Les Paul Standard w/ Original Hardshell Case in Tobacco Sunburst, made in Nashville, USA in 1980! This incredible Les Paul is in Excellent Condition with no breaks or repairs and original frets. Serial number indicates that it was made July 30th, 1980 in Nashville, Tennessee and was the 21st guitar completed that day. This will be packed well and insured with signature required for delivery, ready to tune up and play on arrival! This Les Paul Standard features it\u2019s original pickups, pots and hardware with a bound rosewood fretboard on maple neck, carved maple top on solid one-piece mahogany back, tobacco Sunburst finish, original tuners and frets with Original Hard Shell Case. This guitar sounds incredible and plays like a dream, with a wonderful and comfortable neck profile. The original frets show some wear and play great up and down the fretboard with excellent action. There are some scratches and dings with some chipping around the edges near the bottom, definitely no cracks, breaks or repairs. The tobacco burst finish looks amazing with some player\u2019s wear on the back of the neck and is original with no touch-ups. The coil taps and phase mini-switches were professionally installed back in the 80s by previous owner and they work great, with some great tonal options. The original CTS pots all date to late 1979 and the electronics work great with no scratchy pots or issues. This Les Paul is the real deal and not a back breaker, weighing in at just under 9.5 lbs. on my postal scale. Recently set up with D\u2019Addario 10s and ready to rock. The original hardshell case is included and shows some wear, with torn tolex and minor damage on the bottom, all latches and hinges working fine. This will be packed and shipped with experience you can trust and insured with signature required for delivery. Be sure to check out my other guitars for sale and thanks for looking!
