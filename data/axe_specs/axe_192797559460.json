{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Our eBay Store About Us Epiphone Wildkat Hollow Body Electric Guitar (Antique Natural) This smaller-body semi-hollow guitar has great vintage semi-hollow sound and is remarkably comfortable to play! Epiphone is a leader in Archtop guitars and has been since the 1930s. An early pioneer in archtops even before they were electrified, Epiphone was never afraid to do something out of the ordinary. With no notable changes in Archtop design by anybody in decades, Epiphone took the Archtop and practically married it with a solid body guitar. The Wildkats innovative design starts with a solid piece of warm, sustain-rich Mahogany that is computer-routed to create an acoustic guitar-like body except while leaving the \u201ccenter block\u201d area. The body is then covered with a beautiful laminated flame-maple top to create a semi-hollow body masterpiece. The Wildkat\u2019s Mahogany body is matched with a hand-fitted, glued-in solid maple neck for maximum tone and sustain. It features a Rosewood fingerboard and an authentic Chrome B70 licensed Bigsby vibrato for even more sonic versatility. The vintage voice of this \u2018Kat comes from a pair of Epiphone \"dog ear\" P- 90 Classic pickups specifically designed by Epiphone. Other appointments include the historic metal Epiphone name \u201cbadge\u201d on the headstock as well as a unique control configuration of 1-bridge volume, 1-neck volume, 1-master tone and 1-master volume. These controls are powered by Epiphone\u2019s full-size 1\u201d 500K potentiometers and matched with Epiphone\u2019s superior all-metal toggle switch and heavy-duty output jack. The Wildkat also features premium 16:1 Grover machine heads for superior tuning stability. All of this great design comes together with fabulous vintage semi-hollow tone and great sustain plus, being slight larger than a Les Paul and smaller than a 335 size its lightweight and really comfortable to play!
