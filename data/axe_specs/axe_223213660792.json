{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Alright, so here we have . . . well, okay - I'm not entirely certain. It's a Gibson (have some of the original paperwork). It's a Les Paul. It's a beautiful Heritage Cherry Sunburst with nickel hardware. I have the Gibson \"Pre-Pack Checklist\" that states the model number is \"LP5+HSNH1\", which if you do a web search basically says \"Les Paul rounded 50s neck - heritage cherry sunburst - nickel hardware\" (I don't think the \"+\" or the \"1\" at the end signify anything, or if they do I forgot. And that's where it's a bit of a puzzle because the 2008 Les Paul Standards began using different tuners, a locking jack, and other things that aren't present on this guitar. So . . . my best guess is it was built in 2008 but to 2007 (or earlier) specs. At any rate, beautiful guitar, great feel to the rosewood neck (not richlite or baked maple!), and a healthy rounded 50s neck profile in your hand. Plays great, sounds great, and frankly IS a great guitar, but I recently picked up a Les Paul Deluxe and I'm gonna roll with that as the only LP around the house for awhile. So, I'm letting this go to someone else. Comes with original hardshell case and a good chunk of the original paperwork. Recently cleaned and given the once over by the good people at Fuller's Vintage here in Houston. P.S. It is most likely chambered, NOT solid solid, and not swiss cheese weight relieved. Will add more details during the auction as they come to mind. Additional pics will be posted as needed. Happy to answer any questions. Please wait for a final invoice before PayPal payment so that I can include an accurate ship total. Shipping will be via FedEx, so please - no P.O. Boxes, no FPOs, and NO SHIPPING OUTSIDE U.S.A.
