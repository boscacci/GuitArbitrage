{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "CUT YOUR TEETH ON THIS SEVEN STRING TONE MACHINE.... AT A GREAT PRICE!! This is a 2008 BLACK IBANEZ RG-7321 ELECTRIC GUITAR. It is in perfect structural condition. It is 100% original. It has light normal finish marks, dings, scuffs and scratches on the body. The back of the neck has one noticeable mark behind the 4th fret, but not deep or rough enough to be annoying. The guitar is complete except for the truss rod cover. This is a great, solid guitar, especially when you consider it is already 10 years old. Features include... black hardware, sealed tuners, five piece maple laminated Wizard profile neck, bound rosewood 24 fret fingerboard with dot markers, ebony gloss black finish body, matching black headstock with mirror logo, two Ibanez humbucker pickups, 5 way pickup selector switch, volume control, tone control, fixed bridge. Here is a rundown of the pickup selector switching... Position 1: neck series, 2: neck parallel, 3: both humbuckers, 4: both single coils (tapped), 5: bridge pickup. The truss rod works as it should; neck is straight (with proper, slight forward relief). All the electronics work as they should, no scratchy pots. The frets and finger board are in great shape. I have completely serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the frets, cleaned and conditioned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the body and neck, installed new strings (Ernie Ball, Super Slinky 9-52's), adjusted the bridge and intonation, etc. It is playing great and SOUNDS GREAT!
