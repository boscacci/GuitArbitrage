Cosmetically, it has a minor ding near the input jack, as well as a few scratches on the back of the body (see photos). Otherwise, it's very clean. It also came with a new set of Ernie Ball Slinky strings already installed (10-52's). Everything on the guitar is stock, with the exception of upgraded Fender locking tuners. We straightened out the neck and set the action at the 12th fret to 3/64\" (bass side) and 2/64\" (treble side). The frets do have some noticeable wear, but there are no dead spots anywhere and the guitar plays very cleanly up and down the neck. Knobs and switches operate smoothly with no noise and all electronics are in perfect working order. Guitar didn't come to us with a case, but we're throwing in a new Fender G&G case to sweeten the deal! This Fat Tele is good to go and ready for its next musical adventure!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
