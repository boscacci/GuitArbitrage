Lots of emails about this rare guitar, no one seems to be able to identify what model it actually is, here's an email I got: Ahoy! I was checking out your 2013 SG 60s Tribute, and I thought I would help clear up any confusion there may be about it. It is definitely a 60s Tribute, and the guitar pictured DOES have 24 frets. There have been 60s Tributes of other model years which differ, but the 2013 SG Tributes had 24 frets and crown fret markers. There were 4 models: the 50s Tribute, 60s Tribute, 70s Tribute, and Future Tribute. They all differed slightly, but each had the same body and neck with 24 frets and crown fret markers, silk screened logos, but NONE came with a pick guard. Yours has a nice aftermarket pick guard. The 50s Tributes had P90 pickups and \"PROTOTYPE\" stamped on rear of headstock. The 70s Tributes had Dirty Fingers humbuckers and the Norlin style headstock volute. 50s, 60s, and 70s Tributes had satin finishes and Grover tuners, which could be upgraded to E-tune. The Future Tributes had vintage gloss finishes, 57 Classic humbuckers, and either E-tuners or Steinberger banjo style 19:1 tuners.
