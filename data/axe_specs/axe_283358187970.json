{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson 2008 Les Paul R7 Goldtop 57 Reissue. Condition is Used. I purchased this a year or so ago here on eBay and have only played it occasionally at home. When not in use it has lived in its case (original black Gibson Custom case). As far as I can tell it is all original except for the strap locks that I installed (original buttons are included). There are no breaks or repairs but there is some natural checking horizontally on the front of the guitar especially near volume and tone knobs. There are also a few dents and dings that I feel are minor but check the photos and judge for yourself. I have the guitar set up with 10's and the action is relatively low so there is a little fret rattle here and there but nothing major. There is no COA included unfortunately. If you have any questions please let me know. All items sold as is. No returns please. Shipping is via Fed Ex Ground to the continental United States ONLY. Payment accepted through PayPal only. I will send an invoice within 24 hours of the end of the auction. If payment is not received within 3 days after invoice is sent eBay will be notified. Please contact me if you require additional time to make payment or if you have any questions. **SHIPPING NOTE: Selling on eBay is not my primary source of income therefore I am forced to ship items around my work schedule which often does not allow me to ship out immediately after payment is received. There may be a few days delay before I can get your purchase in the mail. If this poses a problem, please DO NOT bid on this item.
