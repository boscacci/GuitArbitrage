{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding Here is a very nice all original Gretsch Double Anniversay in the coveted Smoke Green color that aged very well--the last photo tries to show the checking which is minimal for a 6 year old guitar but still there on the front--the hardware is in good shape--the neck angle is perfect--the truss rod works and has room left if needed although current action and neck relief is perfect for my preferences--12th fret e string is at 3/32nds with no fret buzz to speak of. Frets are excellent--the tuners hold tune--the cosmetic issues are a small ding on the neck--some checking as mentioned and a cracked pickguard which is in place a solid and doesn't move when played--the binding is in great shape for this old--most of the older Gretsch guitars suffer bad binding rot across all models but this one is very solid--some little staining around the heel--minor cracking in a few places but generally very sound everywhere-- 1960 was the first year Gretsch when from the filtertrons to the hi-lo trons on the double annie so they really spent a lot of time on this model year getting it just right--the guitar plays wonderfully and from a few feet away presents beautifully--if you aren't familiar with the hi-lo trons you might google them--they are not screamers but subtle and uniquely flavored with a tone and range and sound like really nothing else -- they remind me a bit of the dearmonds from this same period that guild used--maybe a bit like the Franz pups as well--great blues and jazz pickups-- the case is original and a bit ragged but it does the job--the guitar has been hanging on my wall and so smells fresh but the case has an old case smell--not bad--i am currently airing it out and it is already in one day noticeably better-- I will sell overseas but contact me for a shipping quote--from my zip to Spain just cost $170 (i'm as far north and west as you can get in the mainland US)thanks for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar may also be for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID":
