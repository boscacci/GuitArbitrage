{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This one has been in the family quite a few years. This 2002 USA made Fender Deluxe Stratocaster (Version 1) has many attributes of the early Strat Plus's, namely the LSR Roller Nut, 2-Point floating Trem, Locking tuners and some Noiseless pickups. The HSS setup came with the Samarium Cobalt Humbucker which was quite unimpressive, this was replaced with a Seymour Duncan 'PEARLY GATES PLUS' big step up in tone! Original humbucker is long gone. The guitar is in Very good condition, with no chips, no worn frets and no electronics issues. Due to actual use, there is some finish scrolling (not deep enough to be scratches) on back from belt buckles, and swirl marks from cleaning after every use. The Trans Crimson finish shows off the Alder wood grain underneath beautifully and the abalone dots add just the right amount of swank for a Strat This guitar comes with the coolest of all Fender Cases! Red plush interior with the Chrome Fender badge on the outside, all latches work key is included and there is still some fender brochures/posters in the cubby.
