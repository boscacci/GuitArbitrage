{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am selling a used but in very good condition Fender American Special HSS Stratocaster. The guitar is Sunburst in color. I recently replaced the bridge and bridge block and added the wammy bar. It has a new set of D'Addario NY/XL 09/42 strings. It also includes a WolfPak Polyfoam travel case. NOTE: I have had a few questions regarding the serial number and Fenders system. There was a brief time in Fender's production between June of 2009, and March of 2010 where they were testing out a new S/N system. This system quickly got replaced, but some of the instruments during this time frame do not show up in the lookup tool. They are in Fender's data base but to run the S/N you need to call or email. I have attached both my original receipt from a very reputable re-seller here in Tulsa along with the email response I got back from Fender on the particulars of the instrument I am selling. If you have any doubt you can call or shoot Fender an email. They got back to me in less than a day with the one attached. Hope that clears it up. This is a beautiful guitar. Thanks for looking.
