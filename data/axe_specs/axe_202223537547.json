{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Very rare one of a kind early model Private Stock (#1042) Santana 12-String in mint condition. Serial Number 6-108168. You will probably never find another 12-string PRS electric guitar like this one. This guitar has been virtually unplayed for the past 12 years. It's been kept in its suede private stock case under the bed for well over a decade and has never left the house. I am the original purchaser and ordered it directly from the factory. This guitar is so unplayed, it even has the original factory strings. The guitar comes with all of the case candy you see in the pictures (which is everything sent by PRS from the factory). The bird inlays are made of real 14-karat gold with engraved feathers. I took a close-up picture of one of the birds so you can better see the beauty of these the birds. I purposely did not polish this guitar before photoing because the light reflection coming from the camera makes it difficult to eliminate light spots that appear in a picture as a flaw. There are no flaws on the body (neither top nor back), the neck, the fretboard, or the headstock. This guitar is 100% and will be deliver freshly polished. Woods are: Neck: Brazilian Rosewood Fingerboard: Brazilian Rosewood Top: Quilted Maple Back: South American Mahogany Headstock Veneer: Quilted Maple Inlay: Etched 14 karat gold with gold mother of pearl purfing along the top contour of the body, and on the contour of the headstock veneer. Pickups: Treble: 12 string Middle: Lindy Frailin Bass: 12 string Electronics: 12 String with a 3-way toggle switch Hardware: Gold PRS stoptail and gold new locking mini tuning pegs along with ebony buttons. Set-Up: 012's - 2 - 2 1/3 All reasonable offers will be considered.", "ItemID": "202223537547", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T15:33:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-02-09T19:59:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-PRS-Santana-12-String-Private-Stock-Mint-Condition-/202223537547", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Duluth, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/guoAAOSw5utafftz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/crYAAOSwNMVaffun/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ExgAAOSw9HFaffuk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ksIAAOSwx6laffum/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eu8AAOSwvktaffuj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LR8AAOSwla1affuj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EjwAAOSw5RRaffuj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0NMAAOSw3wVafful/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/K7wAAOSwdTJaffwE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yw4AAOSwXtNaffun/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8aAAAOSwBwdaffvO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zYwAAOSw8RZaffvP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30097", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dibenjo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 62, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 12700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 12700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 23}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2006 PRS Santana 12-String Private Stock (Mint Condition)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Quilted Maple"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Private Stock"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Santana Private Stock"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["12 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Tortoise Shell"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["One of a kind"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 1705, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
