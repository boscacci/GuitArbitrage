{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Harmony Rebel H82G Electric Guitar Sunburst - Guitar has been tested and the electronics are operational. I do not know the specific year, I don't see a date code on it. The serial number is 4373. There are scuffs, scratches, and dings on the head, neck, and body of the guitar. There are some cracks on the body as well. Pick guard is missing a screw. The Tone/Volume knobs are missing (stems are there and operational). There are 5 washers missing on the head. Chrome hardware has scuffs/scratches. Someone lowered the tremolo at some point, the original holes are exposed. When I tested the guitar, I went down every fret on each string and didn't hear any buzzing. I do not play guitar, and cannot speak to how well it plays. There are other scuffs, scratches, and dings that may not be visible in the photos. If you would like more detailed photos of specific areas of the guitar please ask. Does not include the stand, does not have a case. Please look over all pictures carefully.
