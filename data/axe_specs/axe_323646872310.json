{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this 1990 American Deluxe Strat Plus in very good condition. To start with, this guitar is in a Mystic Black finish. This guitar is in excellent condition. There are a few scratches on the back of the guitar. I've tried to capture them in the images. According to Fender, everything on this guitar is original equipment. The pick guard and tremolo spring cover plate are 3 ply white and in excellent condition. The controls and pickups are aged white. Standard is the Fender 5 way pick up selector switch. However on this guitar, the 2nd tone knob also serves as the control for the TBX Tone Circuit when the pick up selector switch is in the 4th position ( Middle/Bridge ). The TBX tone circuit gives you even more tone selections than just the standard pickup selection and tone knob settings. The pickups are all Fender Lace Sensor Gold. The bridge is the fully adjustable solid metal bridge sections model as are used on the current American Elite series of Stratocasters, with a screw in whammy bar ( Included) and a standard Fender tremolo tailpiece. The particular guitar has a mild V shape adjustable ( micro tilt ) maple neck with rolled edges, highly detailed and finished medium jumbo frets and a dark rosewood fret board . There is minimal fret wear. The nut is a Wilkinson Roller Bearing Nut, and the tuning gears are brushed chrome Shaller locking machines. There are no string trees on Fender guitars equipped with roller bearing nuts. The serial number indicates this is guitar was manufactured in 1990 although Fender could not 100% verify it's exact production date. This guitar comes complete with Tremolo bar and it's original Fender Plus molded case. And certainly, please feel free to ask any questions and good luck!
