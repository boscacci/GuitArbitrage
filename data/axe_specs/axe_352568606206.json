{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx,no PO Boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Most deliveries will require a signature. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack HH Tele\". The 21 fret maple/rosewood neck neck has zero fret wear,and has a had a nice headstock makeover with many coats of clear over the decal . Has dot inlays. The Body looks very nice, just very mild surface scratches. The pickups are a rail type humbucker in the bridge position,about 16k. The neck is a Black/Cream humbucker at about 8k. I then added a push/pull tone control so the humbuckers can be split into single coils by pulling up on the tone control knob. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. These pickups sound killer on this guitar. The capacitor has been upgraded with a Japanese polyester film capacitor,more range of tone control and a smoother response. Guitar looks,plays, and sounds great ! Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
