{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I'm moving some more gear, just in time for Christmas. I'm letting go of my Fender American Deluxe HSS strat; this guitar is from the American Deluxe Series made at the Corona, CA plant in 2001. You can check out all the specs online, but here are some highlights: LSR roller nut, locking tuners, noiseless pickups, abalone fret dots, pop in trem arm, and rolled edges on the frets (this was made before the s-1 switching). This really is a beautiful guitar in what I think is called Chrome Red (it almost has a metallic look to it that looks great with the maple neck/fret board). There's a couple of dings just below the trem and on the upper horn (see pics) and the clear coat is chipped around the low E tuner (see pic). These are simply cosmetic and don't affect play. It could use a new set of strings and maybe a fresh set up, though it's set up perfectly for me. The frets are in fantastic shape. The LSR nut and locking tuners keep it in rock solid tune and it's a very versatile guitar. When I sold my Les Paul, the HSS configuration with the humbucker provided me the tones for heavier music. The noiseless pickups sound great, too. The case looks a little old (it's just sat under the bed for years) but it does it's job and comes with the keys. I'll throw in the groovy matching locking strap, too. The stand in the pics is not included. I partially covered the serial number to prevent any forgeries (I've heard of this happening). S and H is $85 to the continental United States only, please. It well be well packaged and insured and shipped most likely by UPS ground. Please ask any and all questions and thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "323565178319", "EndTime": "2018-11-30T15:48:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-23T15:48:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2001-FENDER-AMERICAN-DELUXE-HSS-STRATOCASTER-HARD-CASE-/323565178319", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Benton, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235651783198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vVUAAOSw1rpb-BmY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-XkAAOSwJ6Nb-BmY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J~sAAOSwlypb-BmZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HygAAOSwZtNb-BmY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o7QAAOSwDBxb-BmZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N3oAAOSwwXRb-Bmb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8JEAAOSwdLhb-BmZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fAMAAOSwaSVb-Bmb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/am0AAOSwosdb-Bmc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tE0AAOSw1KRb-Bmb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ixYAAOSw6dhb-Bmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pKEAAOSwiwZb-Bmc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "42025", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "btsiress", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 422, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 709.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 709.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1306}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2001 FENDER AMERICAN DELUXE HSS STRATOCASTER WITH HARD CASE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster HSS"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 316, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 719.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
