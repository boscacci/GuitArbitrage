{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello and thank you for looking at my Paul Reed Smith Custom 24 Limited Blue fade, Artist Top, Gold Hardware, 59/09s, #162/200 (could be 168/200 as the number has faded a bit and I am unsure of the number) - Limited to 200, case candy, bird tag, and extra plate. Apparently, the prior owner left the signed back plate on the guitar and the gold writing is worn off. I swapped it out when I received the guitar and have left it in the case pocket. The guitar is in excellent condition save for some gold plating tarnish, a few surface swirls, and on the plastic covers. They can't be photographed as I tried. It hasn't been played maybe 5 hours at my home since I bought it in 2012 and has sat in it's case since I owned it (I am the second owner). BTW - I took the pictures outside in the sunlight. The prior owner told me that the Custom Limited 24 was supposed to be the first \"official\" 200 guitars to feature the \"new\" 5 blade switch for 2010 and onward, as I understand it. That said, it is a beautiful guitar and the 59/09s are a nice hotter version of the 57/07s. IMO, back in the \"day\", approximately a decade or so, when a PRS guitar comes out as a Limited model, it usually is a small batch run with Artist or Wood Library woods and sometimes new features. Those \"runs\" were so successful that PRS has a program where dealers now have Wood Library runs that typically are around $5000. Winning bidder must pay via Pay Pal at the end of auction and will be sent to the verified Pay Pal address only. Auction is for the lower 48 CONNUS states only. No shipping outside the United States. FOB Shipping and insurance is free for this auction. Please... no returns as I am not a music store. The guitar is working and functional but cosmetically isn't new/perfect as described.
