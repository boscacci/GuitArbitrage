{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am getting rid of some gear that I don't use anymore so this is a very unique opportunity to own a piece of Agalloch history. This is the Godin Exit 22 I used between 2007 - 2010. It was used in the studio for \"The White EP\" and one or two guitar layers on \"Marrow of the Spirit\". I also used it on 2008 and 2009 tours in the US and Europe, including the show in Vosselaar, Belgium that was filmed for \"The Silence of Forgotten Landscapes\" DVD. In addition, I am including the (rather beat up) case that I used on those tours, a sealed copy of that DVD, AND one of the banners used during that era. NO ONE else on the planet owns a piece of any Agalloch stage decor so this is about as rare as it gets. I will provide a signed letter of authenticity as well as a list of all the places on tour it was used. The guitar itself plays fine and will probably need a setup and maybe some fretwork but that's up to the buyer. Agalloch was notorious for being hard on gear and this guitar was no exception. There are a few scrapes and dings from being thrown down onto my pedalboard at the end of a set night after night. These are purely cosmetic things though and the guitar is in pretty incredible shape all things considered. I also had locking tuners installed back when I bought it and they still function perfectly. The shipping cost is for US buyers only, sorry. I was quoted $157 by UPS to have it packed and shipped by them. If it costs less than that in the end, I will refund the difference. If someone in the Portland area wins this auction, I would be willing to wave the shipping cost and do a local pickup. I would also be willing to deliver it to the winning bidder as far north as Seattle and as far south as Eugene and just charge for gas.", "ItemID": "232991246591", "EndTime": "2018-11-10T01:00:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-03T01:00:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Godin-exit-22-guitar-owned-John-Agalloch-Includes-collectible-items-/232991246591", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Portland, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2329912465918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/kDkAAOSwhrFb0693/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/bYIAAOSwfdNb06-P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/RAIAAOSw0Rlb06-k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/e7gAAOSw7fxb06-2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/AuIAAOSwEJlb06~L/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/ViMAAOSwE7db06~V/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/PmQAAOSwRNtb06~r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc5WDY1OQ==/z/Uc8AAOSw2X5b06~0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "97223", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dammerung_arts", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2067, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 17, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1185.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1185.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 2}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Godin exit 22 guitar owned by John from Agalloch.
