{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a Fender Squier SE Special Edition Stratocaster guitar. This Strat has a great \"relic\" finish. It looks like a Pre-CBS 50 year old Road Warrior. The neck is a very nice, \"chunky\" SE neck with full size Stratocaster nut, unlike most Squiers - Excellent condition, minimal fret wear. Aged pickguard, knobs and pickup covers. The tone on the SE Strats is very nice. The pickups on this Strat were upgraded with new Alnico V pickups. The electronics are in great condition. The SE Special Edition model is extremely well reviewed and considered one of Squiers best Stratocasters. This model is no longer in production. The SE Strats are considered some of the best guitars Squier has made and they are very highly sought after and considered the holy grail for modders - superb modding platforms due it's it's excellent craftsmanship and full thickness, solid body. The Special Edition is a FULL-SIZE Stratocaster body with a thickness of 1 3/4 inches - same dimensions as the USA, MIJ, and MIM Fender Strats. (Unlike many other Squiers, such as the Affinity and most Bullet models, which feature thinner bodies). This example is in great overall playing condition. I've had more Fender Stratocasters over the decades than I can remember (including a 1962) and one of my favorites is a Squier SE model. I'm not an expert but I always try to describe as best I can.
