{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2013 Gibson SG 70's Tribute Guitar Red 24 Frets with Brand New Hard Case. Used but in Excellent almost mint condition. Only minor flaws exist. I purchased the hard case for this guitar which shipped with a gig bag when it came from the Gibson factory.You can tell that the case has never been used by the lack of any impressions in the plush lining in the lid from having other guitars in it. The photo of the guitar in case was taken the first time it was placed inside before closing it. Built in the image of the world-beating SG Standards of the 1970s, the SG 70s Tribute starts with a foundation of solid mahogany crafted in the distinctive, thin asymmetrical dual-cutaway style, with iconic pointed horns and beveled edges to enhance playing comfort. A solid mahogany neck is glued into the body carved to a characteristic medium 70s profile that measures .810 at the 1st fret and .930 at the 12th, with period-correct volute to strengthen the back-angled headstock. It is topped with a genuine rosewood fingerboard that carries 24 medium-jumbo frets to maximize the upper reach afforded by the SG' body style, and traditional trapezoid inlays.It takes its firepower from a pair of Gibson Dirty Fingers humbucking pickups, a legendary component of 70s rock and among the two hottest pickups that Gibson has ever designed. They include powerful ceramic magnets and over-wound coils for a sizzling, sustainful sound that remains clear and articulate. The traditional wiring complement of an independent volume and tone control per pickup plus a three-way toggle selector switch allows a broad range of sonic variations.
