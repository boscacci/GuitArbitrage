{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a GRECO EGC58-100. This guitar is from 1982 and is amazing! It is Japanese Guitar Maker Greco\u2019s version of a Les Paul Custom and it does not disappoint! It is in great shape, for being 36 years old. Ther eare some scratches and dings, but nothing major and it is 100% playable. This model is made with an all Mahogany body and top and ebony fretboard. It weighs in at close to 9 lbs, so it\u2019s a beast, but the weight makes for great tone and sustain. Previous owner installed Tone Rider Rocksong and Alnico II pickups but the original Groove 1982 Pickups are supplied, as is the pickguard. I swapped the stock Truss Rod Cover with a Gibson style cover, and the original is included. Super great action and the pickups really compliment the guitar. This guitar sings, and other than the headstock logo, you\u2019d think you were playing areal \u201cG\u201d guitar. Case is included *winning payment must be made within 72 hours of winning auction. $40 shipping within the US. International Shipping is available, but buyer must pay for shipping charges. No returns, unless item is received in condition other than listed and pictured. Don't hesitate to contact me, with any questions. Offers are welcome!
