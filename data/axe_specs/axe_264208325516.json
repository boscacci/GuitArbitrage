{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "First introduced in the late 1970\u2019s, the Super Swede has always been considered one of Hagstrom\u2019s flagship models. Each Super Swede is crafted using a mahogany body, maple top, and set mahogany neck. With a 25.5\u201d scale length and a pair of coil-split-capable Custom 58 AlNiCo pickups, the Super Swede provides a brighter sounding, longer sustaining, and more flexible single-cutaway guitar for players looking for something more than any regular single-cut can offer. Naturally, the Super Swede is equipped with Hagstrom\u2019s renowned H-Expander truss rod and Resinator fretboard for a playing surface that provides the ultimate in stability, comfort and tone. Hagstrom Machine Heads Hagstrom models use 18:1 or 15:1 gear ratio machine heads based on designs to insure accurate tuning. Viking and HB series basses machine heads with a 17:1 gear ratio. H-Expander All Hagstrom electric guitars and basses include patented H-Expander truss rod. Providing tension at both ends and running the entire length of the neck, the rigid yet light-weight alloy truss rod allows for a very low action and thin neck, two factors that were instrumental in earning Hagstrom its reputation as the world\u2019s fastest playing guitar. The H-Expander truss rod not only provides ultimate neck stability, but it also contributes to Hagstrom\u2019s unique tone. Longer sustain and a round attack are some of the sonic characteristics the H-Expander adds to the tonal essence of Hagstrom. Resinator Wood Resinator wood is a wood composite material that is both more uniform in density and more stable than any standard wood product. These characteristics eliminate dead spots or \u201cwolf tones\u201d sometimes associated with conventional wood fingerboards. Resinator wood has an articulate sound similar to high quality ebony, but without any of the problems associated with ebony. It provides a stable and clear tone, and also adds higher overtones and harmonics which uniquely detail each note. Like our H-Expander truss rod, Resinator wood is a major contributor to the distinctive \u201cHagstrom tone\u201d. Sustain Block Tailpiece Hagstrom\u2019s unique Sustain Block Tailpiece was the result of design work starting in 1976 and made its first appearance on Swede and Super Swede guitars produced in 1978. Since then it has been a signature on many solid body models. Each string terminates in a single, massive brass block coupled directly to the guitar\u2019s body. The blocks are detached from one another to reduce interference between the strings, maximizing each string\u2019s unique contribution.
