{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction is a 2017 Williams Guitars USA Koa Bich Style 10 String guitar. Listed as used, as it has been a \u2018shop demo\u2019 and kept in my basement studio as a personal guitar for the past few years. It has signs of light playing wear, but no abuse or major dings. I built this as a tribute to the classic 70\u2019s style model, having worked with and been trained by some of the original craftsmen that were part of the early BC Rich crew. Wings are solid Hawaiian koa, as well as the neck, which was shaped from a near impossible to find 3\u201dx3\u201d piece which extends the length of the body. Rosewood Head plate. Figured Maple stringers. Pickups are Dimarzio\u2014a newer Super Distortion in the bridge paired with a vintage Dimarzio PAF. Originally a 2-conductor pickup converted to 4-conductor, just like the old ones were. Electronics are from a Moser loom. Hand cut gold MOP Cloud markers and gold MOP \u2018W\u2019 Logo. Backplate and TRC are also from Moser, signed by Neal on the back. There are top and back headstock ferrules should you decide to string the additional octave strings. I think it\u2019s an improvement as the strings could dig into the wood without both sets of ferrules. Newer Grover Imperial Tuners. The Graph Tech nut deviates from the original style, and is cut for a 6 string, as I used this guitar as a 6-string,like Joe Perry did. It looks weird to me to not have the bottom 4 tuners as that was the intent for the original design of the guitar, and it can be converted to a 10-string should the user desire it. The neck is slim and fast\u2014one of the best playing necks I\u2019ve ever made. Dunlop Strap Locks. Thin nitro lacquer finish as opposed to the thick poly finish like the old ones. Can be set up with either .009s or .010s depending on preference. Width at nut:1.69 Weight:7.7 lbs. Body Thickness: 1.45\" Scale: 24.75\" Modified G&G Schecter hardshell case.The need for new shop tools overrides my need for personal guitars. hence the reason for this listing. I have done my best to provide a fair assessment of the guitar to avoid any surprises, but please feel free to ask any questions prior to bidding, as there are no returns. Ships to Cont'l USA only.
