{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson 2001 SG Special, this guitar is all original. The guitar is in great shape and plays well, it has spent a lot of time in it's case. This limited edition guitar has a two tone chameleon paint on it from the Gibson factory, it's essentially high end auto paint.l they custom mixed. This particular model was part of an extremely limited edition run, these guitars won't be made like this again thus this this is a very rare instrument. This guitar is a true collectors piece or a wonderful addition to any well rounded collection, it is essentially a functional art piece which plays beautifully. This is an excellent example of a very rare guitar, very hard to find in this condition. Gibson only made this SG special from 2001-2005. Features: Genuine Gibson Made in USA. Mahogany body Mahogany neck 3 way toggle switch 2 Humbuckers. 2 volume, 2 tone. Rosewood finger board, dot inlays, dot side markers. Screened Gibson logo. 5 ply pick guard. Good vibes. This guitar spent years on Maui entertaining folks, and eventually made its way up to Oregon. It has always been treated very well, lived in its case and was appropriately cared for in the context of moisture and such. I am getting rid of its simply because I want to focus more on the melding of Electronic music and old school instruments like the violin and cello and piano. I feel that letting this guitar sit mostly unused is basically a crime considering how much joy it could potentially bring the right person. There are no problems with this guitar. There are no breaks or repairs. I cannot see any \"checking\" at all in the paint or finish. The Neck is perfect except for two small cracks in the paint where the neck joins the body, this is typical for a guitar this age thats been played and does not affect function and is barely visible, the neck is perfectly straight. This guitar has been going strong since 2001, and thus has some minor aesthetic damage associated with normal use. All minor damage is pictured and I've discounted accordingly. A couple small dings on the head stock please see pictures. There are minor paint imperfections here and there, but they are, for the most part too small to photograph accurately. There is a chip on the bottom of the guitar, this was my bad...and I have discounted accordingly. I contacted Gibson but they no longer make the paint. I have pictured the chip, it is barely noticeable and cannot be seen from the front of the guitar, roughly 1cm. I am including a totally awesome Gibson Hardshell case (suitable for travel as the case is made for this guitar and has a built in combination lock. I am also including an \"ultimate guitar stand\" which is an excellent heavy duty stand that folds down to roughly the size of a human forearm or overgrown zucchini. http://www.ultimatesupport.com/products/guitar-stands/genesis-series-guitar-stands/gs-100.html Please email me for any additional info you'd like or more pictures if need be. Happy Bidding. ITEM WILL BE SHIPPED OUT IN 1 BUSINESS DAY (Except weekends and holidays) VIA USPS (OR OTHER IF INTL.) INSURED MAIL.

This guitar is in great shape and plays very well, it has spent a lot of time in it's case.  That is why this guitar is in such great condition.  This guitar has more of a small metal flake finish, as shown in the headstock pictures below.   That is the uniqueness of this \"Blue Teal Flip Flop\" finish on this Gibson SG Special.  It is a different color under different light conditions.  Similar to the beautiful water of the Key's and Caribbean.  Lots of shades of blue and turquoise.  This guitar looks awesome on stage under the lights.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
