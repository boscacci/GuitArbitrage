{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "GIBSON LES PAUL FADED T - MINT CONDITION WITH LEATHER GIBSON GIG BAG This guitar was bought for a student who has basically played it a few hours and then never looked at it again, therefore you are getting as close to a brand new guitar as you can get (see pics). No fret wear (see pics)***** Remember to check out my 100% five star customer reviews. *****The benefits of a modern Gibson guitar and the appeal of a pawn shop prize - both are yours with the Gibson Les Paul Faded T. The Les Paul Faded T's new-meets-old approach is exemplified in three key features: a SlimTaper maple neck shaped to mimic the natural wear of decades of playing; a weight-relieved mahogany body, which you'll be able and proud to strap on for hours at a time with its low weight and Faded Gloss finish; and a pair of Gibson 490 pickups that speak with a golden PAF-like tone, only with more bite and wax potting to reduce squeals.
