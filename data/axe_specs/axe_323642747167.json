{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Daion Mugen Mark II Made in Japan. - dreadnought style, solid cedar top, hardwood neck, round soundhole, white binding, redwood sides/two-piece back, 14/20-fret rosewood fingerboard with white dot inlay, rosewood bridge, rosewood pickguard, three-per-side chrome sealed tuning machines, available in Natural finish, mfg. late 1970s-mid-1980s. The bridge is cracked and will eventually need replaced but it is holding and is playable now. My son has been playing it and it sounds great. I provided pictures. Please ask questions if needed. I do not ship internationally without the buyer contacting me first to arrange shipping cost so please bid only if you have a U. S. address or contact me to discuss shipping cost. Buyer pays $55.00 shipping with the U. S.. This is a used item and has minor defects such as scratches and dings in the finish. I do my best to show all major defects in the photos and description but it is impossible to account for every small defect that can be expected on used/vintage. Items. I only state this obvious fact because I learned the hard way that if a buyer complains that they could not see a small scratch in the finish and I do not mention it, Ebay will view it as a legitimate reason for a buyer to request a refund. Please ask questions if you have concerns. I will be happy to take additional photos if you need me to. Thanks for your time and understanding.", "ItemID": "323642747167", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T19:09:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T02:50:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Daion-Mugen-Mark-II-Made-Japan-/323642747167", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Worth, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236427471678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IBIAAOSwfMlcNq6u/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L70AAOSw-GNcNq6-/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XsAAAOSwFtNcNq7f/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sUoAAOSwK1dcNq8K/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AbsAAOSwMKVcNq8m/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jf4AAOSwwZVcNq9F/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9HUAAOSwVmBcNq9s/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wpYAAOSwOShcNq-c/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "76116", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "markgilmore", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1683, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 213}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Daion Mugen Mark II       Made in Japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 24, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
