{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Squier Stratocaster with Roadworn Relic finish and hardware. Great 60's vibe with vintage style Fender logo decal on headstock and retro \"Lucky Lady\" pinup decal on bout. This is a true road warrior with plenty of roadhouse battle scars and great vibe. It plays and sounds great. Authentic style relic wear. Neck is nice - chunkier than typical modern Squiers and minimal visible fret wear and amber vintage finish. The body had a crack (visible on the back) that was professionally repaired and is solid as a rock - adds relic character! Vintage style bridge saddles. Aged pickguard and pickup covers. Killer relic finish and \"Spaghetti\" logo on the headstock. This Strat looks like a 50 year old time traveler. The guitar plays nicely as built but you may want to set it up to your preferences. Great guitar for decor also. Please see pics. Here's an opportunity to own your own custom relic Strat for a fraction of the cost of a Fender Custom Shop guitar. Priced to sell! I've tried to describe the guitar as best and thoroughly as I can, but I'm not an expert but sold as is since it is relic'd. So please feel free to ask any questions. Shipping to Continental U.S. only.
