With neck strap and pick. Ready to play Strat! 3-4 dings in body finish on side, but hardly noticeable. Tremolo bar not included. On Nov-13-18 at 16:01:01 PST, seller added the following information: I've been told by a helpful eBayer that is is a Fender Squier Affinty series guitar, not a Fender Standard series. On Nov-15-18 at 14:43:38 PST, seller added the following information: So I've now been told by another eBayer that this is a CXS series Fender Squier. Made at the AXL factory. Better than an Affinity but not as good as a Standard. Here is more info from a web site. \"The squiers that were made at the AXL factory will usually have a serial number sticker rather than being painted directly on the headstock. The serial will start will most likely start with CXS or in rarer instances CAE. AXL made the much desired SE (Special Edition) model. The SE is desired because it has a full size 1 3/4 agathis body. Most Bullet and Affinity models are thin 1 1/2 bodies. The SE measures 43mm at the nut. Most Affinity models have 41mm nuts. They were made well, have fantastic 9.5 radius C shaped necks and they are just an all around perfect modding platform. They are very easy to identify due to the logo just saying \"STRAT\" on the headstocks, as well as them being the model of Squier to have a Squier logo stamped into the sealed tuners. I think most people consider them inbetween an Affinity and a Standard as far as quality.\"", "ItemID": "323545302139", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T02:00:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T02:00:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-Squier-Standard-Electric-Guitar-Sunburst-Design-Strat-/323545302139", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Sicklerville, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235453021398080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eBIAAOSwy3Jb6MS1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dtAAAOSwPeVb6LuJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YK0AAOSw36pb6Lvq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/q3wAAOSwPGtb6Luf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LWsAAOSwsO5b6Ltd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/begAAOSwK5Fb6Ltf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KBcAAOSwZ1hb6Ltz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "08081", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lurklad", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3029, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 27, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 127.52, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 127.52, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 110}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster Squier Standard Electric Guitar Sunburst Design Strat", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["CXS"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Squire"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["032-1600-537"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["0321600537"]}]}, "HitCount": 919, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=4454567", "StoreName": "Gr8+Stuff+4+Even+Less"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 130.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "144335661", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
