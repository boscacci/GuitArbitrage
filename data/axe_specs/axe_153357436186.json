Today, Fender has boldly cleared the slate to make way for a fresh American Vintage series with fresh features, hotter specs, and the most meticulous level of vintage accuracy yet. Rather than just replacing the previous models with different ones, they've completely and comprehensively re-imagined the entire vintage-reissue concept--restoring original tooling dies, pickups, reformulating vintage colors and more--based on actual vintage guitars they tracked down to make sure they had it right. Fender did the work, and it shows, because there's pure tonal magic in each American Vintage instrument.
