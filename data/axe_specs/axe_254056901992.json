The maple neck is has had a very nice headstock makeover with many coats of clear over the decal. Near zero fret wear . The bridge is a modern string through the body six saddle bridge. The very cool Lake Placid Blue body is in excellent condition, just mild surface scratches. The pickups are P90 in the neck position[about 9k]. The bridge is a rail type humbucker at a whopping 16k. I also upgraded the tone capacitor with a nice Japanese mylar film capacitor . All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion.
