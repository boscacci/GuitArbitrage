{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2007 Schecter V-1 I bought brand new from Guitar Center. Has small scratches near bottom of both horn ends. And a paint crack from where the strap bung is. There is a small amount of wear on the black hardware as well. All pictured comes w/SKB flight case. Specs: The 2007 Schecter Hellraiser V-1 features electronics that are unsurpassed. In the bridge position, an EMG-81TW has a dual-mode design that gives you all the crunch and aggressiveness of the original EMG-81 plus a single-coil sound with a fatter tone with plenty of punch and clarity. Dual internal preamps, one tuned for single-coil mode and the other for dual-coil mode, give the 81TW two distinct sounds. An EMG-89 in the neck position also has separate preamps each providing custom outputs for both dual coil and single coil modes. The 89 is loaded with Alnico V magnets for a vintage strat sound. The different modes are accessed through push/pull volume pots. Together these pickups give you a range of tones that will surprise you and your audience. The body of the Hellraiser V-1 Electric Guitar not only looks awesome, but allows you unhindered access to the 25-1/2\" scale mahogany set neck with Ultra access that is fitted with a rosewood fingerboard set with 24 extra-jumbo frets. Thru-body string threading adds to the tonal sustain of this instrument. The Hellraiser V-1 Guitar has black hardware, abalone binding, and gothic cross inlays that all add to the dark vibe of this demonically inspired Schecter guitar.
