{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a 1973 Gibson SG Standard in a factory original Walnut finish. The finish has average playwear- some scratches, bumps and finish wear. There's an old headstock repair - completely stable and comes with a 30 day money back guarantee. It has the original Gibson epoxy back or Tar Backs and they sound great. The pots, pickups caps and all solder joint look original and unmolested. The pots date to the 3rd week of 1973 and the serial # is 896672. The neck is straight and the frets look original. This is a nice vintage piece that is really fun to play with a super slim neck. Please look at all 50+ pictures- they accurately represent the condition of this instrument.
