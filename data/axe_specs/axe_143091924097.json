Taylor T3/B Semi-hollowbody Electric Guitar at a Glance:The evolution of a modern Taylor classicSay \"wow\" to the woodBig tone, great flexibilityThe evolution of a modern Taylor classicThe hybrid Taylor T5 wowed players with its impressive melding of acoustic and electric properties. Now, Taylor brings the body profile of the T5 to an electric guitar that more than holds its own against the classic axes. Rather than braced hollowbody design, the T3/B uses a sapele body with a solid block of wood running down its center. The solid maple top is affixed to both the block and the sides without the need for additional bracing. A vintage-modern roller bridge and Bigsby tailpiece takes the place of the T5's acoustic-style bridge (a fixed bridge and stop tailpiece are available on the T3 model). This full-on electric semi-hollowbody completes a transition from pure acoustic to hybrid to full electric, and, in the process, gives you incredible quality, tone, playability, and comfort.Say \"wow\" to the woodJust a quick glance at the T3's figured maple top is enough to make you want to pick it up. Upon closer evaluation, you'll find that this great-looking top's depth and beautiful figure visually complement its design perfectly - while providing the perfect \"snap\" to add to the T3's rich tone. From the binding to the f-holes to the chrome hardware and pickup rings, the T3's accents are as note-perfect as its great sound.Big tone, great flexibilityIf you're looking for fat jazz tones from a manageable, thinline body style, you've come to the right place. The T3's two humbucking pickups provide plenty of thick tone, but that's just the beginning. You can choose between neck, neck/bridge, and bridge settings, activate a coil-tap for single-coil tones, and even engage a second capacitor for even fatter tone. This means everyone from jazz aficionados to rockers can enjoy the T3/B's attributes - from cool and restrained to crunchy and rude.Taylor T3/B Semi-hollowbody Electric Guitar Features:Color: NaturalTop: Figured mapleBody: SapeleNeck: SapeleScale length: 24-7/8\"Fingerboard: Ebony with electric-style fretsNo. of frets: 21Fingerboard Inlays: 4mm MOP dotsHardware: Chrome-platedTuning machines: Taylor chromeBridge: Roller bridge with Bigsby tremolo tailpiece (fixed bridge with stoptail available on T3)Pickups: Two Taylor Style 2 HD humbuckersControls: Volume and tone, with coil tap on Volume knob and extra capacitor engagement push-pull on Tone knob; 3-way selector switchCase: Deluxe hardshell", "ItemID": "143091924097", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T11:57:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-15T18:38:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Taylor-T3-Bigsby-TB-Tobacco-Sunburst-Hard-Case-/143091924097", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Edmonton, Alberta", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430919240978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hycAAOSwxO9cL89s/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cQkAAOSwKwhcL89u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8scAAOSwjkZcL89M/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VswAAOSw8U9cL89O/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/COsAAOSwHDdcL89R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/giMAAOSw0~pcL89w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LxcAAOSw2pBcL89y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/94YAAOSw~xtcL890/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LmcAAOSwTQNcL892/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fBwAAOSw6X1cL894/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VNYAAOSwQ5pcL895/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "T6E 5V1", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "keelca_1cruxcy9", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1518.6, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 206}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Taylor T3 Bigsby TB Tobacco Sunburst With Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Taylor"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["T3"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 221, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
