{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "UP FOR AUCTION IS MY 2003 EXCELLENT CONDITION EPIPHONE LES PAUL STANDARD PLUS TOP ELECTRIC GUITAR AND SKB MOLDED HARDSHELL CASE. THIS GUITAR IS IN THE VERY NICE HERITAGE CHERRY SUNBURST FLAME TOP FINISH AND IT LOOKS FANTASTIC. AS YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE IN THE GUITAR HAS BEEN PLAYED VERY LITTLE AND IS IN EXCELLENT ORIGINAL CONDITION. NOT SURE WHY IT HAS A REPLACED REAR CONTROL COVER BUT IT WAS THAT WAY WHEN I PURCHASED IT. A MATCHING CREAM COLORED ONE CAN EASILY BE PURCHASED OFF EBAY FOR CHEAP. THE GUITAR HAS A FANTASTIC EASY PLAYING NECK. THE ORIGINAL ORIGINAL HUMBUCKER PICKUPS HAVE A NICE CLEAN VINTAGE TONE TO THEM BUT WILL REALLY GROWL WHEN PUSHED AND THE GUITAR IS NICE AND LIGHT/RESONANT. THIS IS A FAR SUPERIOR GUITAR THAN THE CHINESE EPIPHONES BEING PRODUCED TODAY. IT HAS BEEN PROFESSIONALLY CLEANED, POLISHED AND FACTORY SET UP WITH NEW STRINGS. THIS IS A FANTASTIC LOOKING AND WONDERFUL PLAYING GUITAR THAT IS SURE TO MAKE SOME LUCKY EBAYER VERY HAPPY.
