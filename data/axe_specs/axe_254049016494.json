{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Rare Fender Stratocaster Special MIM 1995 HSS Coil Tap Ash Veneer Blonde Gig Bag Click images to enlarge Description This sale is for a used Fender Stratocaster Special made in Mexico in 1995. This model was only made for a few years, 1994-96, & in low production totals. The alder or poplar body features an ash veneer on the top. The body has a gloss see thru blonde finish similar to a Mary Kaye model. The finish on this is slightly opaque, but the grain is still visible. The neck has a thick, vintage style rosewood slab board, with vintage style tuners, & a vintage style spaghetti logo. Unlike other MIM strats of the era, this body has a large \"swimming pool \" rout, like USA made strats, to accomodate the electronics. The stock electronics feature an HSS configuration, with master volume & master tone controls, & a toggle switch for coil tap in the 3rd knob position. The vintage style tremolo bridge appears to be a USA made 57/62 reissue version. It is in good condition cosmetically for its age. There are marks, swirls, & dents. There is obvious playwear on the pickguard, & noticeable fret wear in the 1st position only. There is no buckle rash, damaged areas, or repairs. The coil tap toggle is slightly bent, but functions perfectly. The trem arm is included, & is also slightly bent. This model is fairly rare, some what obscure, & not very many show up for sale. Ships in a newer, very nice Fender gig bag \u00a0as shown. The neck is straight, the action good, the truss rod, & all electronics function properly. FREE SHIPPING.
