There are no dings or dents on this guitar. Comes with bag. This model is a resurrection of the cult classic 90's Squier Vista Series Super-Sonic. It's uniqueness comes from its diminutive offset \"reverse\" body (resembling an upside-down Jazzmaster or Jaguar) and upside-down headstock. Another unique features is that the neck pickup volume and bridge pickup volume only (no tone control) are reverse-wired like the Squier original.Neck Type: \"C\"Color: Red SparkleBound Neck: Unbound NeckHardware Color: ChromeCase: Gig BagNeck Wood: 1-Piece MapleFretboard Wood: RosewoodPickup Configuration: \"Two Humbuckers\"Inlay Style: DotBody Wood: AlderIF YOU BUY IT AND YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WE HAVE THE 30 DAY MONEY BACK RETURN POLICY READ BELOW - THANK YOU SOLD AS USED AND AS IS ,BUT YOU DO HAVE 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF DELIVERY TO CONTACT US FOR A REFUND IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY : Buyer is responsible for shipping charges back to us.
