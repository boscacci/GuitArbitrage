Featuring Gibson USA Soapbar P-90 pickups, gold hardware, an Ebony fretboard, and a vintage style hard case. Epiphone and Mr. Les Paul Epiphone\u2019s long friendship with Mr. Les Paul dates back to the 1940s when Les, working after-hours at the original Epiphone factory in Manhattan, created one of the world\u2019s first solid body electric guitars which he nicknamed \u201cThe Log\u201d. It wasn\u2019t long before \u201cThe Log\u201d evolved into the legendary Les Paul. Throughout his life, Les continued to work closely with Epiphone reviewing new products and offering suggestions. \u201cThey are damn fine instruments, I swear by them!\u201d said Les. The Epiphone Ltd. Ed. Inspired by \"1955\" Les Paul Custom\u2122 Outfit is an historic reissue of the \u201ctuxedo\u201d Les Paul that Les designed to be the most beautiful electric guitar ever made with a striking Ebony finish with gold hardware that would not only look great with a \u201ctux\u201d but would also convince skeptics that the new\u2014and controversial--\u201csolid body\u201d electric guitar was a refined and classy instrument.
