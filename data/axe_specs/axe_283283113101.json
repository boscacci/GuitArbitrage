{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I have an Ernie Ball Music Man Albert Lee signature guitar here. This one sports HH double humbuckers that are completely passive with no active electronics. It is a hardtail model.Most noteworthy about this guitar is it has a solid rosewood neck shaft. That is prestigious and quite pretty, but the best part about it is the tone. This is one of the few guitars that truly has a sweet treble/high end without sounding shrill or bland. The rosewood neck has a prominent, deep tone. It's definitely different than just having a rosewood fretboard. Again i would describe it as sounding deeper and more penetrating with it's overall tone.It does not sound \"dark\" or muddy in any way either. The guitar has excellent clarity, the pickups which are stock, have nice articulation and dynamics, to my ears they have a vintage influenced sound to them with perhaps a bit more contemporary power and output. But not voiced overly \"modern\". Conditionally the guitar is in great shape. With no noteworthy dings or blemishes or playwear that i can find. There may be very faint signs of use. But overall i would say it's at least a 9.4/10 grade. I am seeing just a bit of tarnish/patina on the bridge saddles and a little oxidation on the pickup covers. This guitar has been sheltered and played responsibly throughout it's life and it shows. The setup plays perfectly and the electronics are working perfectly as well. There is some mild wear on the EBMM hardcase. It's a beautiful cream color that is somewhat hard to make look stunning in photographs because it lacks contrast. The finish work gives excellent depth to the color. It looks nice in pictures but not as stunning as i feel it does in person. So overall this is a fine EBMM guitar, with versatile possibilities. The rosewood neck gives it a tremendous woody tone that cannot be reproduced by electronics and gadgets. Only premium tonewood will get you this tone and this guitar has it in spades.", "ItemID": "283283113101", "EndTime": "2018-12-22T08:10:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-29T22:18:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ernie-Ball-Music-Man-Albert-Lee-HH-/283283113101", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Nashua, New Hampshire", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832831131018080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/DKgAAOSwAbxcAGTQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/5A8AAOSwc6ZcAGTN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/LQgAAOSworNcAGTN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/UdUAAOSwUMBcAGTN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/-IAAAOSwg-tcAGTO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/wooAAOSw851cAGTO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/Yt4AAOSwWAhcAGTN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/Sn0AAOSwEX5cAGTO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/Vg0AAOSwsn9cAGTN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/~t4AAOSwhexcAGTN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/z84AAOSwq6VcAGTO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/na0AAOSwlkpcAGTP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "03060", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jacobmccabe95", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 24, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 50.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1099.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1099.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 320}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ernie Ball Music Man Albert Lee HH", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Music Man"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Albert Lee"]}]}, "HitCount": 288, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
