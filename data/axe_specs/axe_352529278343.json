{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Surf Green Tom DeLonge Fender Statocaster holds a special place in my heart, but due to neglect in recent years, it's time to find it a new home to be fully cherished once again. While uncasing and plugging in this surf green dream for the first time in a long time, I Immediately begin to remember why this is such a great guitar. It's nearly perfectly held its tune. This speaks volumes for the quality of the instrument, and is also a great sign for the state of the fretboard, which is in perfect form. During periods of storage, persistent tension from the strings is critical in order to prevent the neck and fretboard from warping over time. The action on this guitar is fantastic, and there's nothing like experiencing the joy of playing a guitar set with just the right action. Time to test the electronics... I flip on my Fender blues jr., turn down the master volume and crank the volume knob all the way up, easily finding the deep rich natural gain produced by the Seymour Duncan SH-8 Invader Bridge pickup. I readjust the volume back to normal and am once again pleasantly surprised by this customized Stratocaster's ability to also achieve a clean, bright sound - tones that rival my epiphone les paul fitted with gibson humbuckers. I found this guitar to be very versatile, with the right adjustments. This guitar dates back to the early 2000's, but is in great condition. It always remained safe in my home, climate controlled. It was not used for gigs, so the surf green finish remains intact and looking great - no belt scratches on the back of the body. There are a couple dings to be pointed out. Most notably an impressed dent on the rear bottom of the body (pictured above) and a ding on the head of the guitar. In the last picture, look to the left of the middle tuning rods, on the backside of the head, you'll see the scratch on the edge. Other than that this guitar is in great shape, including the electronics. This listing will ship with the cloth case the guitar came with. It's a decent enough case, but more importantly, it will help the guitar ship to you unscathed. The strings are quite old, so I'm going to go ahead and throw in a new pack of strings, too. On top of that, I am going to include some new tuning rods. I never installed them because the stock tuners actually worked quite well, but if you're in the mood to tinker while restringing - these new pieces of hardware will look quite sharp. Shipping will be USPS retail ground, due to it's size, But if you're close enough, priority may be available as an option and I will do that instead - to get you this sweet guitar asap. Thanks for checking out my listing!", "ItemID": "352529278343", "EndTime": "2018-11-28T19:27:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-28T07:13:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Tom-DeLonge-Stratocaster-surf-green-hardtail-guitar-/352529278343", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525292783438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/WikAAOSwPuRb~SE1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/YT4AAOSwKphb~SFe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cukAAOSwCXFb~SLe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE5WDE2MDA=/z/K64AAOSwn6Jb~SF4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0MlgxNjAw/z/8W8AAOSwIS9b~SFn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ni4AAOSwZbVb~i4F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/Em0AAOSw1qhb~i3~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/TkcAAOSwyPFb~SFs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Us0AAOSw-iZb~SFz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OVgxNjAw/z/UjUAAOSwKtlb~SF8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SpwAAOSwVYhb~SF-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gq0AAOSwenJb~i47/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "55435", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "alpaw_62", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 4, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 101}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Tom DeLonge Stratocaster surf green\u00a0hardtail guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Special Run"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Delux"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Surf Green"]}]}, "HitCount": 16, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 709.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
