{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Gibson Songwriters Deluxe Custom EC, Acoustic Electric Guitar, 6 strings, right handed. It is in excellent condition, rarely played, part of a large collection that I am downsizing. With its cutaway design, abalone trim and distinctive mother of pearl fingerboard and head-stock inlays, the Songwriter Deluxe Custom EC is among the finest offerings of the songwriter family of acoustic guitars. The top of the Gibson Songwriter Deluxe is made from AA-grade Sitka spruce, while the back and sides are constructed from rosewood, giving it a balanced, warm tone with clear lows and solid treble registers. The pick-guard on the Gibson Songwriter Deluxe Cutaway model is a custom line design made from Tortec. As with all of Gibson's pick-guards, the coloring, inlay and binding are all done by hand. New this guitar was over $4,000.00, and it looks like brand new now. You won't be disappointed this is a beautiful guitar.", "ItemID": "352594726816", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T03:01:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T02:46:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Songwriter-Deluxe-Custom-EC-Acoustic-Electric-Guitar-Hard-Case-/352594726816", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cape Coral, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525947268168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kXgAAOSwWrNcGm3x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8fkAAOSwO7dcGm3y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xyYAAOSw1IhcGm3z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/By4AAOSwL-xcGm31/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZQ0AAOSwYj9cGm33/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3BwAAOSwOt5cGm34/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5mYAAOSwdwVcGm35/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kIsAAOSw4otcGm37/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/s6IAAOSwnh5cGm38/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rZgAAOSwxJ9cGm3-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33991", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "alsue67", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 684, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 160}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Songwriter Deluxe Custom EC Acoustic Electric Guitar with Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom Deluxe"]}]}, "HitCount": 55, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This is in beautiful condition it is part of a large collection, I am downsizing.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
