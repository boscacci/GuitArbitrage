{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Limited edition Fender USA Telecaster. It is shockingly light weight. The single coil bridge pickup is quite crunchy and the neck humbucker is super creamy. The action is low and plays great. As for condition: This guitar has definitely been played. It has two cracks in the body. One near the neck joint and one at the bottom below the bridge (see pics). I had it inspected by a professional luthier and he said that they were stable and didn't need repair, unless for cosmetic purposes. I have had no intonation or tuning issues. It actually stays in tune really well. The neck is in near perfect shape.
