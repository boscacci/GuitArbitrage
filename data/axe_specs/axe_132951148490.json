You are looking at a Vintage 1967 Univox / Matsumoku ES-335 Hollow Body. Matsumoku was known as the premier guitar builder in the \"Golden Age\" of Japanese guitar manufacturing. This is a really great sounding and playing guitar. This Univox is all original. It even has the original Trem bar! Original pickups and electronics. The only thing missing is the plastic Univox headstock logo. If you are after that \"Trashy\" 1960's tone, (Kinks, Stones) this guitar will deliver! Affordable Japanese Vintage! Our luthier did a complete setup. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Nut Width: 1.56\" Weight: 7.90 lbs. Case is NOT Included Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. Cosmetics: Good Condition. Keep in mind that this is a 52 year old guitar that has been played. Because of the age, the entire body is lacquer checked. There is an approximately 6 inch finish crack on the back of the guitar. Cosmetic only NOT Structural. A couple of very light strumming scratches on the pickguard. A few scratches and a few chips here and there. Back is relatively clean. Does have some typical minor buckle rash. Univox headstock logo is missing. Neck, Fingerboard and Headstock in great shape. Pristine. Dripping with \"Mojo\". It is used. Not perfect. Overall, a really nice guitar. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story.
