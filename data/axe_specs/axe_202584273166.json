{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling my personal slightly-used Dean Palomino Solo Hollow Body Electric Jazz Guitar. Beautiful gloss flame maple finish both front, back and sides. All gold hardware, beautiful fingerboard with block inlays and a potent Mini Humbucker pickup. Guitar has one volume and one tone knob. It comes in an older case that is in decent shape. I bought it without a case but I did not want to ship it without something protecting it. You might want to get a better one after you get it. I took the pick guard bracket off because it was easier for me to play it. When I went to put it back on one of the screws were missing. The one that goes over the side and attaches to the body. In a couple of the pics you will see a black screw in its placed. I only put that screw in there to hold it steady while I was taking the pics. I did not fully screw it in so it has not damaged the wood. I will remove that screw when I ship unless you had rather me leave it in. I might take the pick-guard off when I am shipping so there will not be any movement that might scratch the finish. The guitar is in like new condition in every-way. Plays over the top great. Low, Low playing hours on the gtr. (3?). Sounds great direct into LOGIC and sounds really great coming out of Fender amp. The brass/gold screw will need to be replaced. Prob. cost 5 cents.Please purchase with confidence. I am a 18 year EBAYER with a 100% rating. Good look.", "ItemID": "202584273166", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T16:04:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T20:30:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dean-Palomino-Solo-Electric-Jazz-Guitar-Pristine-Condition-/202584273166", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Dunmor, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025842731668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5Q8AAOSwg-tcVKXy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/A7IAAOSwKL5cVKXz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G3QAAOSwSfJcVKXx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UDYAAOSwltxcVKXx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WNsAAOSwIABcVKXy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2TAAAOSwT89cVKXx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ICEAAOSwlINcVKXz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hXUAAOSwjoFcVKX0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r1oAAOSwachcVKX0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GSgAAOSwYX9cVKX0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZsgAAOSwc6ZcVKX2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KuwAAOSwg5FcVKX2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "42339", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pacificarecording", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 820, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 302}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "UY", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Dean Palomino Solo Electric Jazz Guitar / Pristine Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Dean"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["PALAMINOGN", "PALOMINOVSB PALOMINOGN PALAMINOGN", "PALOMINOGN", "PALOMINOVSB"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["PALAMINOGN"]}]}, "HitCount": 40, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "137001864", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
