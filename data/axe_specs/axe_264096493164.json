{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "c.2006 Fender Stratocaster '70s Reissue: This guitar is no longer available so here is your chance. This guitar features a large headstock, \"F\" back vintage style Schaller tuners, a \"Bullet\" truss rod adjustment, three bolt neck with tilt-neck adjustment and grey bottom Vintage reissue pickups wired to a three way switch. Someone put a Brass Nut on it. This guitar is exceptionally clean with no fret wear and no significant dings or dents other than a small chip in the neck pocket on the bass side and some light surface scratches typical of black guitars. The only change to the guitar is the pro installed brass nut. The trem bar may not be original. In addition, the back plate shows some light sticker fading. Otherwise this is a super clean guitar that looks and plays great. Adjusted, cleaned and new strings. The guitar ships in the correct Amp logo Fender hard shell case as shown. Guitars can experience minor changes during shipping due to changes in humidity and temperature that may require minor adjustments. In addition, I can not predict how you may like your guitars set up. Please be aware that the cost of minor adjustments and/or a set-up to your liking should be anticipated whenever buying a guitar through the mail.I will not be responsible for shipping costs in any direction unless the guitar is damaged in shipping. We offer a 48 hour approval period(regardless of what e-bay says). Shipping is via FEDEX Ground unless you have specific needs which I will try to accommodate. Generally I ship within 24 hours but I often travel throughout the US to acquire the guitars I offer here on e-bay so there will be times that shipments may be delayed for a few days. If there is going to be a delay I will notify you.", "ItemID": "264096493164", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T01:17:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-20T16:41:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-Fender-Stratocaster-70s-Reissue-AVRI-70sRI-Ships-Worldwide-Clean-/264096493164", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Syosset, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640964931648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YaoAAOSwo3Bb60To/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vwIAAOSwo1lb60T1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bWcAAOSwpwBb60UB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uCwAAOSwIAJb60UG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ySkAAOSw3T5b60UT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F2cAAOSwEOJb60Ug/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uLIAAOSw3ANb60Ut/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v2gAAOSwo1lb60Uz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sXgAAOSw87lb60U5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/o0UAAOSwLmBb60VA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GPwAAOSwKwhb60VH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cZMAAOSwFZZb60VN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11791", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mygenerationguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3152, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***c", "FeedbackPrivate": true, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2006 Fender Stratocaster 70s Reissue, AVRI '70sRI, Ships Worldwide!
