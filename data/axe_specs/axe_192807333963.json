Based on a little online research, the serial number claims it was manufactured Between 1983-84. I am not the original owner of the Fender Elite so I don't know the history of it. There are various surface imperfections, scratches, small nicks. Please examine the guitar and zoom in on the detailed photos we provided. Ebay only allows 12 so we attempted to take the correct angles. There may be additional blemishes, dings and scratches but nothing major.

Read below: The Elite Stratocaster was introduced in 1983 and discontinued in 1984. It served as a template for the Eric Clapton signature model of 1988. One player of the Elite model is Ty Tabor of King's X, who used this guitar to record the first four albums of that band. His gear setup still retains the preamp from the guitar, now rack mounted.Some of the Elite features have been incorporated into USA-made Fender guitars and basses made after the purchase of the Fender guitar company from CBS by Bill Schultz in 1985. For example the Eric Clapton, Richie Sambora (introduced in 1991) and Buddy Guy (introduced in 1995) signature guitars retain the TBX/MDX design from the Elite.
