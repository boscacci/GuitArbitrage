About the Film: In 1965 Jim Whittaker led Robert Kennedy on the first ascent of a remote mountain in the Yukon named after JFK. Fifty years later, their sons revisit the site of the iconic climb to learn more about the endeavor that shaped their families. Return to Mount Kennedy spans generations, reminding how every trail connects through the enduring friendships built in the mountains. Featuring interviews and several new instrumentals by Eddie Vedder and never before seen footage of the climb, the film sits at the intersection of politics, human rights, environmentalism, and adventure.
