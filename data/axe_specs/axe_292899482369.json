{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a real nice loaded knotty pine tele body I picked up in a trade some time ago. I had it tucked away for a future partscaster project but am doing some house cleaning so it is time to let it go. This one has some real nice grain and knott's in it if you like that raw kind of look for your twang! It has had a light finish applied to it prior to me acquiring it that looks to be professionally done from the factory. The body is about 1 5/8 inch thick, it is manufacturer unknown but is Fender spec, I was trying to size up some necks in it's pocket and a 2010 Fender MIM Standard Telecaster neck fit perfect, the bolt holes aligned perfectly. This body is fully loaded, all you need to do is add a neck and it will be ready to rock! Has a Fender licensed vintage style bridge, the pickups and electronics look and sound decent, however whomever wired this one up did so with the control plate reversed. The 3-way switch is at the bottom of the plate underneath the tone knob instead of at the top above the volume knob like most tele setup's, the volume and tone knobs are in their normal 1&2 positions. Has a hotrail blade style pickup in the neck position. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
