{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Welcome! Please read entire description before bidding or asking questions! Winning bidder must pay for auction within 48 hrs of auction close. Bidders with less than 5 feedbacks, and/or multiple bid retractions,must contactme before bidding. I reserve the right to cancel bids from bidders with a sketchy bidding history. If you have questions, please ask before bidding! You are checking out a Late 80's B.C. Rich Gunslinger in need of a makeover! It is tested and the electronics do work. It requires a 9 volt battery to operate the active pickups. Used to have a Floyd Rose Tail, it was removed and a block was put in to install the hard bridge. Cosmetically it is in need of help. It has all sorts of things everywhere that I can not list all of them, many signatures and hand written things on the rear of the body. Some may be offensive to some, please be warned. Please see pics and judge for yourself! This is being sold as is no returns. Auction includes the B.C. Rich Gunslinger with carry bag only. I highly recommend using Uship for Very delicate heavy or bulky items. They come to me pick it up and deliver it to you safely. You must go to their website and setup an account, (it takes 5 minutes) and make the arrangements yourself. I have had great dealings with this service, but in no way am I responsible for damage during their handling. It is located in West Ft Lauderdale area. Just give them your location and approximate dimensions, for example, \"Drum set with hardware\" they take bids with drivers passing my area to yours, or you can set a price you are willing to spend for the transaction, It works and its easy! Costs less than UPS or Fedex for heavy or bulky items! I use a great deal of packing material to make sure everything arrives safely and this will be shipped in a strong box. . Please keep that in mind when calculating your shipping . Check out my feedback regarding packing! Yes my shipping may be more money then the other guys....but isn't spending a couple of bucks more, better than getting your merchandise damaged? My handling fee covers extra packing material, and or my time to find the best box for your item! FYI, If you pay fast I ship fast! International bidders are responsible for duties.
