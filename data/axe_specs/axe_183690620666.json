{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Schecter Damien Platinum 7-String Left-Handed. I bought this guitar with the hairline fracture on joint. You can see from the photos it'son the neck pocket but the would isn'tthe cause of the fracture, it'sthe paint only. This DOES NOT affect the tuning or seperate more than what you see. It is simply a fracture in the paint around the neck joint, sucks, but it doesn't hurt the sound or leave it out of tune. No longer has active pickups. Has Chinese aftermarkets. They still sound great through the MESA, and it rips. The routing sucks, I know, you can see that in the pictures as well. Selling this cheap, as they sell new for $700, and I know she has her cosmetic issues. It still plays great and stays in tune. You can always go back to active pickups, put some passive bare knuckles in there, or leave the Chinese pickups in it. Condition is Used. Selling as-is, no returns. Need more pics or have questions, let me know.", "ItemID": "183690620666", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T01:12:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T01:12:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Schecter-Damien-Platinum-7-String-Left-Handed-/183690620666", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Three Springs, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836906206668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QQ0AAOSwb2hcYMi7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zCQAAOSw4S1cYMjA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CQoAAOSwaqtcYMjC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WisAAOSwEaxcYMjD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TukAAOSwJrdcYMjF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/61IAAOSw2NhcYMjH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PsYAAOSwaKVcYMjJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SJsAAOSwyhVcYMjL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "17264", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pengre3", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 117, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 180.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 180.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Schecter Damien Platinum 7-String Left-Handed", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Schecter"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Damien Platinum-7"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["1186"]}]}, "HitCount": 67, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 183.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
