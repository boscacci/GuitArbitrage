It has no wear or issues. It comes with a gigbag. Please see pics and message with any questions. Squier's Classic Vibe Telecaster\u00ae '50s puts classic \"blackguard\" Telecaster vibe into a gorgeous Vintage Blonde-finished pine-body guitar--you'll be hard-pressed to tell whether or not you are holding a premium ash-body instrument. The vintage-tint gloss-maple neck has a maple Fingerboard with 21 medium-jumbo frets and a modern 9.5\" radius. Distinctive Telecaster tone rings from the custom alnico III single-coil pickups, giving clear note separation even when distorted, strong midrange dynamic response and plenty of solo high-end bite.
