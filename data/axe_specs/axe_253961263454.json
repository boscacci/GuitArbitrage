It's the Mint Collection, most popular series from Greco. It was made about 33 years ago. The Mint Collection, I feel Greco's policy very much. Accuracy of the product is high, It is deep joint. From the body, the vibration of the sound is transmitted well. Distinctive luster, I predict Lacquer paint. And, clear coating is very thin. About the condition of this guitar, I did not give \" excellent condition \" . Because, the truss rod was very hard in the clockwise direction. Therefore I gave \" Very good+++ condition \" . My first impression is that all is very beautiful. The Metal parts and the Machine heads keep an excellent state. These have shine. I can not think that it is a guitar of 33 years ago. Old japanese guitar used high quality wood. The wood grain of mahogany is very beautiful. There are scratches on the pick guard. Although it is an old guitar, I think that the scratch is little on the body. If you got this guitar, you will understand that the former owner cherished this guitar. \" The High quality guitars at a Low price \". It is brand concept of Greco at the time. And current... It has became high price. 1980, Gibson filed a lawsuit. The cause is copyright issues. And more than anything, Greco's ( Fujigen's ) high degree of perfection. Perhaps Gibson had a feeling of crisis. I think this Greco is very good. Make of Greco (Fujigen) is very polite. Accuracy of the product is high, It is deep joint. It is cleanliness. I polished with guitar exclusive polish, so it is in a very clean state. I after the finger board cleaning, painted beeswax. The aim is moisturizing and and protection. Current neck condition, very good ! roughly straight ! The truss rod was very hard in the clockwise direction. It may be close to the limit. Remaining the frets are 85% on average. You can play immediately after it is delivered to you. All is working well. It is in a very good condition. GIG BAG Included. Look at the photos, please verify by yourself!
