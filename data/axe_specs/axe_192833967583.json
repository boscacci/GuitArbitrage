{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor Guitar with Case late 80's or early 90's New Hardware. Condition is Used. I'm told this is an Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor from the late 80's early 90's. I got it with no pickguard, so I added the black pickguard. Replaced the tuners with gold grover tuners, replaced the bridge, replaced the trapeze tailpiece, and the switch cover. As you know gold hardware gets kind of crappy over time. I'm including all the original hardware, as well as a set of gold pickup covers I just never bothered to install. Comes with case. Plays nice (I'm not really a guitarist so it plays good for me). Has a few knicks and dings as you can see by the photos, but overall in really nice shape. Great tone. Ships to continental US only. PayPal only. Selling locally as well, so may be removed at any time.", "ItemID": "192833967583", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T17:37:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-21T12:22:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Joe-Pass-Emperor-Guitar-Case-late-80s-early-90s-New-Hardware-/192833967583", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Woodbury, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1928339675838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8PYAAOSw35hcbpea/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ryAAAOSwCcZcbpeZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8HIAAOSwroJcbpeY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oN4AAOSwIelcbpeZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3NYAAOSwWKpcbpeZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I-QAAOSw2cRcbpeY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QDQAAOSwl7pcbpeY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QpcAAOSwJjNcbpeZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08096", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mr-sparkle", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 400, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2192}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor Guitar with Case late 80's or early 90's\u00a0 New Hardware", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Joe Pass Emperor"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollowbody"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}]}, "HitCount": 68, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
