{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I really have no idea about this guitar. It tunes beautifully and sounds great - per a guitar friend who checked it out. It comes with a soft case, as shown in the picture. I called Gibson who wrote back the following: \"This appears to be a Steinberger Spirit GU-Deluxe model.\" However, I cannot confirm that it is indeed what they think it is.
