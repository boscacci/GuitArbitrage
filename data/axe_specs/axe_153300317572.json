{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Used Gibson Studio \"Antique\" Les Paul. Natural, satin finish. I believe that this is a Gibson Studio model, with an \"Antique\" look. I call it \"Antique\" because that's how I remember it being described when I bought it. It is NOT a reliced guitar. It is NOT a Gibson Classic Antique Les Paul. No pickguard, but holes have been drilled for a pickguard, probably removed by a previous owner. Previous owner told me that he replaced the pickups but I don't know the brand name or model. Original pickups are not included; I don't have them. No brand markings on the pickups (see photo). Natural binding on the body. I cannot identify the wood used on the body, neck, and fretboard, though the fretboard looks like rosewood. Guitardaterproject.org says it was made in 2011 in Nashville. I don't have a reliable scale, but the guitar is light for a Les Paul. It's a cool-looking Les Paul that has a very woody, old look. Pickups and controls all work well. Intonation is good. Pickups are loud and clean. The action seems a little high for me; you might want to have it set up. Fretboard could use a cleaning. Frets show little use. Strap pins may not be original. Besides those and the pickups, I believe everything else is original, but I can't be sure. Strings are old and tarnished; definitely need to be replaced. Otherwise plays well and sounds good. In good overall condition with some scratches, dings, etc. Specifically, back of the head stock, back of the neck, sides of the guitar, back of the guitar. I don't notice the scratches and the ding on the back of the neck when I'm playing. See the photos for details. Nothing major. The top has a couple of small dings, but is in very good overall condition. If you want to see additional photos, some of which show more pix of the scratches, dings, etc., or if you have other questions, just ask. I'll try to reply ASAP. Comes with a Gibson soft case in good condition. This guitar is also for sale locally. Shipping by USPS is a flat fee of $90, including insurance, but I will refund the difference if shipping is less. Local pick up is available here in Long Beach, CA; in fact, I prefer it. In that case, I will fully refund the shipping fee. All sales final. Of course, I'd like to keep it, but my daughter wants to go to college, so I'm thinning the herd, so to speak.", "ItemID": "153300317572", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T07:55:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-12T07:55:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Studio-Antique-Les-Paul-Natural-Satin-Finish-Upgraded-pickups-Nice-/153300317572", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Long Beach, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533003175728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/mEwAAOSwypZb~iuC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/Us0AAOSwBfhb~iuc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/4ygAAOSw8R9b~iu0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/zE4AAOSwsrlb~ivJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/MSMAAOSwUxlb~ivj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/EE8AAOSwRbpb~iv8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/QpkAAOSwXHxb~iwY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/IrIAAOSw9z1b~ixE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/A7QAAOSwaIpb~ixa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/fEsAAOSwQqZb~ixv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDEyODA=/z/0S0AAOSwzcNb~iyY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/T2EAAOSwQzJb~iys/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90815", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cryingsky", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 386, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1447}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Studio \"Antique\" Les Paul - Natural, Satin Finish, Upgraded pickups, Nice", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["\"Antique\""]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["probably 2011"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 83, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "In good used condition.
