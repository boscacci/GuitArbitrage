{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a quality guitar in all regards. Built by the guys at The Twelfth Fret in Portland, Oregon. It was assembled with Allparts parts body and neck with nice Flame. Blows away any stock American standard or production signature Fender Telecaster you'll find. It has quality Schaller tuners, bone nut, Gotoh bridge with brass barrel saddles. It was purchased from the original owner who owned it since 1999, and has the original Joe Barden Danny Gatton pickups installed, all professionally installed with cts pots and USA 4-way switch. So these are all pre-JBE parts, so pickups were made in Vienna, Virginia. There is one significant gouge on back corner of upper body that was nicely touched up, and some small nicks and scratches that are barely noticeable on body. Neck has some nice flame to it and fingerboard is nice dense and dark piece of wood. Playability is excellent and tone is fantastic. Neck is straight and profile is similar to American Standard and jumbo frets are in 85%+ condition. Guitar is right at 7lbs and easy to wear. You will not be disappointed. Selling only because I need $$$...otherwise I would not. Comes with thin gig bag in decent condition but I reccomend getting a nice hard case for it because you will be toting this thing around, for certain, to your next jam or gig. Please ask any and all questions before bidding if you have any reservations. Thank you for looking and good luck", "ItemID": "303029552552", "EndTime": "2019-01-16T15:16:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T17:38:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/USA-PRO-BUILT-TELECASTER-W-JOE-BARDEN-VIENNA-PICKUPS-TELE-GUITAR-CANDY-APPLE-RW-/303029552552", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Traverse City, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030295525528080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x0QAAOSwpaVcPL-x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/B3wAAOSwNXtcPL~B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lr8AAOSwG6tcPL~f/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j48AAOSw3GlcPL~y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KIIAAOSwYX9cPMAF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oXEAAOSwYwZcPMAQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk5WDE2MDA=/z/cLEAAOSwNepcPMAs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk5WDE2MDA=/z/cDcAAOSwhr9cPMBK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk5WDE2MDA=/z/vfAAAOSwOHpcPMBu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xkwAAOSw-yJcPMCq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MNMAAOSwWI5cPMDG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cSoAAOSwwZVcPMDZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "49685", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "axeshun13", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 447, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.2}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 253}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "USA PRO BUILT TELECASTER W/ JOE BARDEN VIENNA PICKUPS TELE GUITAR CANDY APPLE RW", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["The Twelfth Fret"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1998"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 49, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
