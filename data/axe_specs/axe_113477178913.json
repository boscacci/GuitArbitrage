{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "One set of Gibson Custom Bucker pickups from a 2010 Gibson Custom Shop Historic 1960 Eric Clapton \"Beano\" Les Paul Reissue. These pickups are not commercially available by Gibson. The only way to get a set is to wait until someone takes them out of a Custom Shop model and sells them. These early ones are made really nice and are hard to find. These are some of the early production Custom Buckers that have a genuine nickel plating, smoothly cut screw holes w/subtle dimpling and Patent Applied For sticker, just like the original PAFs. They are \"lightly aged\" by Gibson to match the vintage look of Gibson aged hardware. (Many later production VOS Custom Buckers just have a brushed raw metal surface without any nickel plating.) They are matched wonderfully together and sound amazing with that airy and detailed sound of true vintage PAFs. They can go from bright and edgy to smooth and silky just by a volume or tone knob adjustment. With distortion they really sing and bring out a TON of harmonics in the guitar. The bridge pickup especially has a throaty roar with just the right amount of compression and bloom. They were removed from the guitar just after one year and sealed up to keep the finish in it's original condition.
