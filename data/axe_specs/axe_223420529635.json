{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "YOU ARE BIDDING ON AN EXCELLENT CONDITIONED AUTHENTIC JIMI HENDRIX FENDER STRATOCASTER BLACK ELECTRIC GUITAR (MEXICO). A PHENOMENAL SOUNDING GUITAR AND DEFINITELY ONE FOR THE COLLECTION. PICTURES ARE OF THE ACTUAL GUITAR YOU WILL BE RECEIVING. SOME SMALL DINGS/SCRATCHES ON GUITAR BACK SHOWN IN 7TH PICTURE. IN OTHERWISE, EXCELLENT SHAPE ALL AROUND. COMES WITH BLACK FENDER GIG BAG IN EXCELLENT CONDITION (SEE PICS). Honoring the electrifying \"Voodoo Chile\" who popularized the Stratocaster guitar and its tremendous sonic flexibility, the Jimi Hendrix Stratocaster gives you the same fiery tone and playing feel to wield as your own. Full of incendiary vintage tone and classic style, this extraordinary instrument features signature touches and unique appointments based on his distinctive \"flipped-over\" guitars. The foundation of Hendrix's uniquely personal sound and playing style was his habit of flipping his guitars over and restringing them to accommodate his left-handed playing, resulting in a \"reverse\" headstock and bridge pickup- features reproduced here in exacting detail. The \"reverse\" headstock produces a longer string length for the bass strings, creating a tighter playing feel along with easier bending and vibrato on the treble strings. A trio of unsurpassed American Vintage '65 single-coil pickups includes a reverse-slant bridge pickup, producing uniquely inspiring tone with tight, warm sound and enhanced upper harmonics and definition. The highly versatile 9.5\"-radius \"C\"-shaped maple neck with medium jumbo frets offers a flatter playing surface-ideal for chording while simultaneously allowing you to bend notes to the stratosphere without fear of fretting out during scorching solos. Commemorating Hendrix's unrivaled legacy, the large '70s-style headstock bears the guitarist's signature on the rear. A unique neck plate displays a shoulders-up silhouette of the man himself and the engraved inscription, \"Authentic Hendrix,\" leaving no doubt as to the inspiration behind this guitar.", "ItemID": "223420529635", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T02:53:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-25T02:53:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-STRATOCASTER-JIMI-HENDRIX-MEXICO-BLACK-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-/223420529635", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Lakeland, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2234205296358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cfAAAOSwWtpcahTD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vtIAAOSwlR9cahTw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/a0MAAOSwpp1cahUL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VBQAAOSwTkFcahUY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yA8AAOSwgW9cahU6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ApQAAOSwcY5cahVN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/b6QAAOSwFdFcahWW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~BgAAOSwXCVcahW8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y3AAAOSwsrBcahXS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PhgAAOSwEo1cahXw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33803", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ricep_us2015", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 152, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 610.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 610.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 111}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER STRATOCASTER JIMI HENDRIX MEXICO BLACK ELECTRIC GUITAR", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["FENDER"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["LIMITED EDITION AUTHENTIC JIMI HENDRIX"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["BLACK"]}]}, "HitCount": 100, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 620.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
