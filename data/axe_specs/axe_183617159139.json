{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a \"one owner\" Danelectro Danoblaster Electric Guitar. Ok, right away this guitar is better than perfect there is not a single scratch on it - museum quality, how I managed that for 19 years I don't know. I bought it brand new because a friend had one and the sound blew me away for the money. Yet, I have a bunch of guitars, maybe have played it 10 times in 19 years. It is easy to tune and since the tension was always released a bit from the pegs, the guitar will hold a tune for quite a long time. I put new strings on the guitar a short time ago since it had original factory strings and they are broken in - remain in tune. I am selling it because I am retired and we are moving to a smaller home. I plan to start liquidating my home studio so make me an offer I might take it and will try to respond to all reasonable proposals. :-) It is a pretty unique instrument. For starters, this guitar has 12-strings rather than the standard 6 which most Danelectro guitars have. Danelectro managed to build these guitars with 4 effects built in: distortion, chorus, tremolo, and echo! Believe it or not, they sound great unlike other attempts to build effects into an electric guitar. If guitar effects are not your thing, bypass them altogether by plugging into the bypass output jack. This guitar is equipped with two output jacks. One with effects and the other bypasses altogether. The Danoblaster is set up very similar to a strat in terms of the pickups. You get 3 single coils with 5 different pickup selector positions as you find on a typical strat. There are a master tone and volume pot. In addition, there are two additional knobs for tweaking the effects to your taste. I bought it new in March of 1999 and it has not left my home studio.\\ Please be sure to check my feedback 1080+ all positive. Your happiness is worth any amount of money. I will pack the guitar carefully and help you choose the either the most economical way to ship the guitar. I will also work with the carrier of your choice. Cosmetically, this guitar is 9.8 out of 10.
