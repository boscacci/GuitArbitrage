{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Condition of Instrument This Vivian Campbell is in excellent condition with very minimal signs of use. Includes the original hardshell case and COA. A Legend Times Two How many guitar players can say that they played in TWO legendary bands? Vivian Campbell can, and that\u2019s why he has a new signature Gibson Les Paul Custom! As the main guitarist in Dio, Vivian was responsible for laying down some of the heaviest riffs of the \u201880s. Anyone who\u2019s ever spent time air-guitaring to \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d knows that Vivian\u2019s work with the late Black Sabbath frontman exemplified a rare combination of raw aggression and chops, but he got a chance to show off his more melodic side when he joined Def Leppard in 1992. Every Def Leppard record since has showcased Vivian\u2019s muscular rhythm playing and tasteful lead work as well as his thoughtful songwriting. A Heavy Metal Monster Wildwood Guitars is full of huge Def Leppard and Dio fans, so we are ecstatic to announce that Vivian has partnered with the Gibson Custom Shop to design a guitar befitting his heavy metal legacy! The Vivian Campbell Signature Les Paul Custom is based on Vivian Campbell\u2019s main stage guitar, a Frankensteined creation with a \u201978 Custom neck and a modern lightweight Les Paul Standard body that he tricked out with LP Custom appointments. His new signature model pays homage to the hybrid styling and sound of the original with a few brand new twists that make it a fresh, vital addition to the Gibson Custom family! Rock of Ages First things first: this guitar has a finish unlike anything else the Gibson Custom Shop offers. It\u2019s called Antrim Basalt Burst, and it was inspired by the color of the coastal rock formations outside his hometown in Northern Ireland (rock, rock, \u2018til you drop\u2014literally!). The finish is also unique in that it sports a rubbed patina that adds to the tasteful rustic vibe. Satin chrome hardware and Les Paul Custom \u201ctuxedo\u201d appointments provide the icing on the cake. All in all, this is a Les Paul with stunning looks that will make you want to stand up and kick love into motion! Fiery Tone Fit for a Pyromaniac The tone of this guitar is as awe-inspiring as a rainbow in the dark! You can certainly feel the magic of the soundwaves floating in the air thanks to the set of high-output passive humbuckers from Dimarzio. The neck pickup sounds like baked Alaska: hot, sweet, and creamy. It\u2019s perfect for fat-sounding solos and thick, heavy riffage! The bridge pickup provides the prototypical glam metal rhythm tone, but it sounds thick enough for searing leads, too! Adrenalize Your Left Hand Playing the Vivian Campbell Les Paul Custom is a joy, too! The thin-to-medium C-shaped neck is a dead ringer for the lightning-fast necks attached to all the best Les Pauls from the seventies, so you can shred with precision and grace for hours without fatigue. The satin feel on the back of the neck provides excellent grip and aids left-hand stability, too! It\u2019s also constructed from five pieces of maple and walnut, so you can see its stripe and know it\u2019s clean! Ride the Tiger The Wildwood team is proud to showcase the Vivian Campbell Les Paul Custom for our exceptional customers. Its one-of-a-kind Antrim Basalt Burst finish is inspiring to the eyes, and its powerful, meaty tone is sure to pull lots of radical riffs out of your hands. We invite you to look between the velvet lies and glimpse a truth as hard as steel: the Vivian Campbell Les Paul Custom is one of the coolest artist models ever to come out of the Gibson Custom Shop.
