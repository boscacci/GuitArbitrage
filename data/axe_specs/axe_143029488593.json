Fender Squier Mahogany Thin Line loaded body has been mated with MIM era Maple Neck and aftermarket Tone Rider Alnico II soap bar pick up. C shaped Maple neck is straight and plays great, action is good and neck is clean. Dimensions are 1 5/8\u201d inches at the top nut and 2 3/16\u201d inches at the base with 21 frets in decent condition with some wear at 2nd and 3rd fret area. Modern Fender In-line tuners are installed, with classic headstock that shows one micro scuff mark at the top of the rounded section and the neck has a small eyelash shaped nick on the back at 10th fret, see pics for condition. Original single coil pickup in rear position, neck pickup is an aftermarket Tone Rider Vintage 90 Alnico II Soap Bar pickup which is installed and wired through a separate tone control. Pearloid pick guard is now equipped with two tone controls and a regular volume control. An extra tone pot circuit was added to this pick guard to create individual tone controls for each pick up. All hardware is secured with set nuts, pots and switches hand soldered and mounted securely in the Fender Squier Thin Line body with super polished gloss finish. Guitar is fully built, working and completed as a pet project which turned into my 7th guitar, which is 2 guitars too many according to my wife.
