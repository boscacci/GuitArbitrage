Nice weight and feel - screams when amped up!!Selling to fund other projects. If you've ever wanted a hubcap guitar this one is as fine as you'll find. Below is text from an article appearing in the \"Shropshire Star\" - a British news publication:\"I wanted to take the guitars one step further and build from scratch some good quality necks. With help from my uncle, who is a carpenter, and my dad, who owns a lot of the tools required, I slowly learned the skills it took to build quality instruments.\" Mike produces a wide collection of slide guitars using various hubcap brands like Morris, Riley and Wolseley. Friends and family members were so impressed with both the look and raw tone of his prototypes, he soon started receiving orders from all over the world. \"I've sold around 50 guitars in the last year or so, and currently have more guitars on order.\" Mike has sold guitars to customers as far away as America and Australia. \"My philosophy is to combine the rustic feel reflected in the retro hubcaps used for the body and raw tone of the guitar, with a sleek and polished finish that adds a touch of class,\" said Mike. \"Although I really enjoy building the guitars - and can now make one in three to four hours, I hope to keep this as a hobby rather than a full-time career. I really enjoy the technical work, which is why I decided to return to college to do a Higher Education course. \"The foundation degree has given me the chance to build on my knowledge and I've pick up a lot of new skills.\" Electrical engineering tutor, John Watts, said: \"He has a very impressive natural talent. His hubcap guitars are brilliant.\"", "ItemID": "113563637732", "EndTime": "2019-01-20T11:12:44.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T12:48:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/HSG-Hubcap-Slide-Guitar-Cigar-Box-Guitar-style-4-string-/113563637732", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Egg Harbor City, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135636377328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY1WDY2NQ==/z/7okAAOSwzqtcOP43/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY1WDY2NQ==/z/IJ8AAOSwuNNcOP44/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY1WDY2NQ==/z/u-UAAOSwaiBcOP45/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MjAxWDY2NQ==/z/bm8AAOSwMkdcOP5C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "08215", "PrimaryCategoryID": "181221", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Cigar Box Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "joedog680", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 206, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1734}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "HSG Hubcap Slide Guitar - Cigar Box Guitar style 4 string", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United Kingdom"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["HSG"]}]}, "HitCount": 137, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:181221", "SecondaryCategoryID": "33034", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
