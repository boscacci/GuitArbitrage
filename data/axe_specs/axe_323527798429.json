{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Carvin V220 Made in USA with Original Hard Case. Based on the serial number it is 1984 to 1987 time frame. Carvin made the V220 from 1984 to 1989 and then re-introduced in 1987. This is an awesome guitar with a killer sound. I am surprised it is a hardtail instead of having a tremolo. It has what I will say are significant cosmetic issues but some may disagree. Someone scratched spider webs and the words Rigor Mortis into the top. This may all buff out if someone puts the effort into it but I wouldn't bet on it. The thing I find interesting about it is that the Metal Band Rigor Mortis was formed in Arlington Texas in the late 1980s and I found this guitar in a pawnshop in a neighboring city. I do not know if it belonged to someone associated with the band or someone who was a REALLY BIG FAN. I scoured the internet hoping to find a picture of David Scaccia (the guitarist for Rigor Mortis) playing this guitar but to my disappointment every picture I found had him playing a Gibson or a Dean. Unfortunately he has passed away so I can not attempt to contact him and ask if the guitar once belonged to him. It would be really cool if it did. Please look at pictures and ask questions if needed. Buyer pays $50.00 Shipping. Use BUY IT NOW and I will ship free. This is a used item and has minor defects such as scratches and dings in the finish. I do my best to show all major defects in the photos and description but it is impossible to account for every small defect that can be expected on used/vintage. Items. I only state this obvious fact because I learned the hard way that if a buyer complains that they could not see a small scratch in the finish and I do not mention it, Ebay will view it as a legitimate reason for a buyer to request a refund. Please ask questions if you have concerns. I will be happy to take additional photos if you need me to. Thanks for your time and understanding.", "ItemID": "323527798429", "EndTime": "2018-11-06T22:29:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-31T20:52:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Carvin-V220-Mid-1980s-Made-USA-OHSC-/323527798429", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Lubbock, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235277984298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4uIAAOSwk6dbkNaA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xZsAAOSw6j1bkNaY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/h9YAAOSw-mdbkNaz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2B4AAOSwG9ZbkNbZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Kp0AAOSwAnlbkNcF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ehgAAOSwRtNbkNce/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2lsAAOSwWlFbkNdA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PQ0AAOSwhxNbkNdd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rmcAAOSwCf9bkNd2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JT8AAOSwofFbkNeH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/p58AAOSwuIRbkNej/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "79413", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "markgilmore", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1683, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 595.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 595.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***f", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 10}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Carvin V220    Mid 1980s     Made in USA   OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 160, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 605.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
