{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1981FENDERBULLET 1MADE N THE U.S.AHi and thanks for looking.This guitar is 100% original.The serial number on the neck,pots and pickups all date to 1981.There are NO cracks,breaks or repairs to this guitar.The neck is straight and the frets and fretboard are in very nice shape.The trussrod works correctly as well as everything else including the electronics.Setup recently with low comfortable action.The guitar has a full scale neck but a smaller tele style body and hot pickups.So,it was kind off Fender's attempt at blending a Tele and a Mustang.I remember the first time that I saw someone play one of these.I couldn't read the logo from the crowd but when he started playing I wanted to find out what it was.So I took a look after the concert.I have been impressed with these guitars since then.This one has a slight bit of figuring in the maple on the headstock.Not much figuring but it is hard to find any figuring on a Fender neck from this time period.The necks on these guitars are great feeling necks.A lot of players buy these just for the necks.Since this one is all original,I had rather not do that.There is one nick in the paint on the top edge where your arm would come across and when you turn the guitar in the light, a lot of surface scratching and swirls can be seen.The hardware has faded with a light relic vibe.Lots of sound samples of this model on the web.The guitar includes the original owners manual that does have some coffee cup stains on the front cover.Also,the original case is included with all the hinges,feet,latches and handle present and working.Please,see all photos and click to enlarge before purchasing.Please Read:PAYMENT:Verified Ebay payments with a Confirmed address.You must contact me before using any other source of payment.SHIPPING : is US Postal Service Insured.USA SHIPPING ONLY : $59.99 or less depending on your location.This covers USPS ground to the West Coast or Priority if
