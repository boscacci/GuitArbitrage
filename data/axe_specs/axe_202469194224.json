Please take a moment to browse our 4,400-plus perfect feedbacks and look forward to receiving superior service. When you buy/win this, you will appreciate our unmatched after-purchase service. We \"Stay with you\" until all elements of the transaction conclude to your satisfaction. Description Policy: Used guitars that are listed as \"Pristine\" are perfect. They are \"as new\"so nothing more to talk about. \"Mint\" are 9.0 to 9.95 condition. In our opinion it is very difficult for a used guitar to be a perfect ie; may have insignificant fine, slight rub marks on the back, pick marks etc. We do describe any meaningful issues at the top of the listing. If there are minor aesthetic issues such as pick marks or not-thru-the-finish rubs and scratches; expect them. We always note if a case or other accessories is included. Cases and other accessories are not included unless stated or pictured in listing. If unclear, please email questions before you buy, Our replies are frank. We often get the question \"why do your prices change?\" Our prices do not \"change\" but do get temporarily lowered when selected for eBay Markdown. When the Markdown sale ends, eBay automatically returns to the normal listed price. The sales rarely are for the duration of the listing ie; our listings are 30 day listings but Markdown sales end in 7 to 10 days. Do not lose out; The sale time remaining is shown at the top of the listing where the pricing info is displayed. We cannot honor sale prices after the sale ends. Important Information About Our Special Sales: We use eBay's 'Markdown Manager' to put select items on Sale reducing the listed price. All our listings display the 14 day return policy but once an item is marked down or on closeout, it is As noted in the eBay published return policy information at the top of the listing, Markdown sales purchases are final. About Pricing decisions:When possible, for comparison, we show retail prices supplied by the manufacturer (\"MSRP\"). Vintage and collectable prices are researched in buyer's guides, eBay prior sales, other online sales and highest prices found for similar items. We have been awarded highest status in which we take great pride. It is awarded for adhering to eBay high standards, for our high level of service, for 4,400+ perfect, enthusiastic feedbacks, for provided candid, articulate guitar descriptions and, above all else for our respect for you! Our customers exhibit the same high standards when submitting a best offer, buy it now or having the high, winning bid. All of these are your promise to honor ebay policy and pay within the 3-day time frame. We believe in you and work really hard to be sure You can believe in Us! Best Offer Sales (\"OBO\"): From time-to-time select-guitars are listed giving you the option to make an offer. This adds some fun and gives you the opportunity to affect the price you buy it for. Obviously we cannot sell at less than we pay for an item but if you make a reasonable offer, leaving some profit, most likely Your offer will be accepted. Your OBO will be responded to immediately. . . We do not play one eBayer off against another. You offer will never be declined, it will be either accepted or get a counteroffer. Please note: OBO or Marked down sale items are all sales final and cannot be returned. Once you make the purchase, it cannot be cancelled. Ebay will respond to the unpaid purchase and if it remains unpaid will result in a non-payer strike which can result in a loss of your eBay privileges. Guitar set ups and strings are not warrantied since rough handling, travel/shipping can affect the setup. This is especially so if being shipped through many zones and atmospheric differences. Prior to listing, Guitars are setup to guitar manufacturer's specs but you should expect to need to set up upon arrival. Most listings use the specification releases of the manufacturer. We assume no responsibility for changes made by manufacturer. . . do not rely on posted specs. Unless otherwise noted or when the quantityis greater than 1, The Guitar pictures used in the listing are always of the actual guitar you will receive. Always rely upon the pics over the printed specs. We no longer list serial Nos. due to the proliferation of knock-offs using stolen serial Numbers. Email for serial number sufficient to check guitar manufacture date. *** exception: new and mint accessory items we may use stock photos, never for guitars. International Buyer Policy: Beginning this 2016, CITES regulation surrounding the international shipment of rosewood instruments has increased s&h costs for international shipments. It is required a CITES certificate be provided for each guitar containing Rosewood.

Packages refused by your country and returned/received back by GuitarStable will receive a full refund of the purchase price less the s&h since s&h is not refunded by usps. Most countries have loss/damage coverage limits, usually 2500usd, if loss/damage occurs we assume no responsibility for amounts in excess of these limits. Inquire if a concern. Due to the higher costs as well as the higher risks involved in international handling, except as noted, we do not accept returns from international buyers. We are happy to work with international buyers but need you to recognize that, relative to domestic shipping, international s&h has greater costs for packaging, documentation and handling.

We also hate disappointing so, when you are going to make an offer consider \"reasonable\" is defined as a offer price that includes profit. Margins on guitars listed are relatively low.
