{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hi and welcome. I'm offering a recent issue Canadian Godin Richmond Dorchester project. Everything you see in the pictures is what you get. You will need a couple of pickups , a bridge and a pair of knobs to finish it off. There has been some tom foolery with the headstock.(image # 9) It appears that someone changed the original tuners to something else and then switched to a set of wilkenson vintage. The tuner ferrules are glued in place and the screw holes are a little loose. This is the main disclosure. Everything else is standard with no modifications. I had it set up and running with a standard gotoh tunematic bridge, some pickups and speed knobs and I had no trouble fitting them without any modification. Also the tuners worked fine for me as well. Condition is excellent with only a small group of dings next to the neck pickup in the body from previously poor packing (image # 1). Otherwise very clean all around. The pots are alpha 500K. A 4 way switch is included. Item will be sent un-assembled in one box well packed.
