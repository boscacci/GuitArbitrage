{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Normal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE Hello! You are looking at an original 1990 Gibson SG special with a 3-knob circuit. This is not an ordinary SG by any means. The neck pickup is a rare Bill Lawrence PCB pickup. The bridge is some type of Gibson PAF. I believe the solder joints are original, so they have not been changed. This guitar came to me in desolate condition. It was covered in rust and gunk and barely worked. I polished the heck out of it and made it shine again. Although the finish on the head-stock looks rough, the head has never been cracked or repaired. What\u2019s been done: -I removed all of the rusted hardware, (included in the auction) -removed the pickups and cleaned them and their cavities -replaced a broken tuner (broken one included, no new holes were drilled) -tightened up all nuts and bolts -restrung -polish polish polish! -oiled and polished the fret board (feels new again!) -Some of the new screws are mis-matched but they do the job. -polished the bridge and tail piece. -raised the tailpiece for easier bending -added matching knobs that actually correspond with their function. About this guitar -The neck pickup is a rare one with 4 leads. It\u2019s a Bill lawrence PCB pickup from 88-91. The cover used to be gold. -Not sure about the bridge pickup. The cover looks original. -Yes, the guitar is beat up, but it\u2019s beat up in a good way. It feels naturally relic-ed. -The frets are actually in really good shape. Very little wear especially in the cowboy territory. -The the neck is very straight. Very healthy. -Not a thin neck by any means, however it is not a chunky one either. -Very unique feel, pearl dot inlays. Very round, somewhat flat radius. -3 knob circuit, master Volume and independent tones for each pickup. -the nut is in great shape. - I can tell that this guitar was not played much. It was kept in bad conditions. Possibly outside in a storage unit. -I determined that because the fretboard, frets, and nut are in such good condition for its age. (28 yrs+) -not the lightest SG I\u2019ve played. Not nearly as heavy as an Epiphone though -I will ship in a gig bag -strung up with a fresh set of regular slinky\u2019s. (.10) What\u2019s unusual about this guitar is they pickups. Most SG specials from this period had uncovered stock Gibson pickups. The pickups look stock (unchanged), but they\u2019re a lot nicer. This guitar was broken and needed restoration. Now its working great and very stable. About me: -I work in a guitar store -I play I\u2019ve been playing in a band for over 10 years -I\u2019ve been building and restoring guitars for almost 10 years. -I hope I described this the best I could Thank you for looking! Check out my other guitars!
