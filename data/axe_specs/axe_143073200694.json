{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a Jackson Performer PS-37 black flying V electric guitar. In good condition with some small (light) scratches and dings but nothing major. There is no major damage or major repairs to the guitar. Brand new unplayed Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings have been added. There is a touch up spot on the back(see picture) that I did because someone tried to sand the cracked paint on it and did a bad job. I've hit it with some touch up 2X black spray paint and polished it the best that I could. The tremolo is a Jackson tremolo and stamped \"licensed by Floyd Rose\" on the bottom with three springs. The pickups are a Duncan Design HB103B at the bridge and a Jackson humbucker at the neck. I've added two brand new higher quality 500K pots to the volume and one the the tone. The selector switch is a switchcraft brand. The guitar sounds great for what it is and there is no humming or fret buzz. I think these were made in China or Korea. The action is about mid action. The neck is straight but does have a spot on the back that looks like a crack and you can feel it when you rub your fingers across it but I thin that was just how it was made and it is still sturdy in that spot(see back of neck photo). Below are the specs. Serial number - 1054100Total length - to long tip - about 47.25\"Nut width - 1 5/8\"Neck - 22 fretsScale - 25.5\"Body - length to neck connection - 24.75\" thickness - 1.75\" lower bout width - about 16\"Weight - about 7 pounds On Jan-01-19 at 06:21:36 PST, seller added the following information: These could have been made in Japan also, I'm not sure. This was the next step up guitar from a beginners guitar made by Jackson.", "ItemID": "143073200694", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T23:01:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T23:01:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-Performer-PS-37-Black-Flying-V-Duncan-Design-Tremolo-1990s-/143073200694", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Canal Fulton, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430732006948080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjI2WDE2MDA=/z/bcYAAOSw2xlcKOVZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc5WDE0MjM=/z/ICMAAOSwfhlcKOVe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/p~oAAOSwcH5cKOVz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjMyWDE2MDA=/z/sFAAAOSwM6FcKOVv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTUzWDE2MDA=/z/grgAAOSwwtdcKOV0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/364AAOSwjMtcKOWF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0NFgxNDc0/z/sBQAAOSwyYRcKOWO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UckAAOSw3GlcKOWO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI1NVgxMDU3/z/JkcAAOSwAThcKOWN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FtoAAOSw5qdcKOWG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eSoAAOSwOVlcKOWP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/plkAAOSwEONcKOWT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44614", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ohiogooseman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1403, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.4}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 145.77, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 145.77, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 156}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson Performer PS-37 Black Flying V Duncan Design Tremolo 1990's ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Performer"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["PS-37 Flying V"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990's"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Jackson Performer"]}]}, "HitCount": 608, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "118985", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118985", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 148.27, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Works great with some touch ups", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
