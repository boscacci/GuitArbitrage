{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "When Steve Vai teamed up with Ibanez in 1987, little did he realize what a lasting impact his signature model guitar would have. Today, the JEM is an iconic instrument immediately identified with the legendary guitarist. Famous for its distinctive look and innovative design, time has seen this popular, upscale guitar become the most counterfeited model in the world. In an effort to make the JEM available to a broader fan base, Ibanez has released the JEMJRSP, providing more affordable access to the magic that is the JEM. Featuring a Mahogany Body attached to a Wizard III neck, the JEMJRSP offers many of the JEM\u2019s distinguishing characteristics; the H/S/H pickup configuration, the \u201cTree of Life\u201d inlay, a double locking tremolo system, and of course, the famous Monkey grip and Lion's Claw tremolo cavity.Features:Mahogany body, including Monkey grip and Lion's Claw tremolo cavityBolt-on Maple Wizard III neck with 24 Jumbo Frets, Jatoba fretboard and \u201cTree of Life\u201d inlayIbanez pickups (INF1 Humbucking neck pickup, INFS1 single coil middle pickup, INF2 humbucking bridge pickup) with 5-way switchDouble-locking tremolo bridge, Cosmo black hardwareNotes: This JEMJRSP Steve Vai Signature is in Very Good condition, with light wear consistent with age and appropriate light use.
