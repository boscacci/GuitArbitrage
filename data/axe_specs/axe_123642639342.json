{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Wow, what an incredible find. These early custom shop strats are rare enough, but to find a lefty... This is a 1989 (second year) Fender Custom Shop Stratocaster. This is a rare guitar to begin with, but add in the fact that its a lefty just takes it up a notch. Then on top of that, add the fact that its finished in Olympic white over seafoam green and its one in a million. Definitely a custom ordered strat, but based on the 57 reissue production model. This guitar is something special. Clearly it wasn't played much. The frets are about 90% and theres barely any wear on the body or neck except for around the neckplate. There's also a hole where an extra strap button was, probably for a righty player at some point. Appears to be all original with the exception of two pots with an active preamp, as well as shielding paint in the cavity. The preamp doesn't seem to be hooked up currently, but the pickups and pots are all working as normal. Its possible the preamp came factory installed because i know the custom shop at this time would put in whatever set of electronics you requested, but i'm going to say its non original just to be safe. Neck is signed by Scott Buehl who is now a masterbuilder in the custom shop. Now, I have listed this for parts or repair because there is a dip in the neck that causes some fretting issues on the higher registers. Not sure whether this could be fixed by heat pressing, or if a planing and refret will be necessary. If youre a lefty and a luthier, then this is for you. It will forever be a 1 of 1 guitar. Also, i want someone to fix it so it can be played enough to wear it down to were the seafoam green starts to show. Ive never before seen this color combo. Please message me with any questions Will include a G&G hardshell case.", "ItemID": "123642639342", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T18:12:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-12T18:12:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Early-Fender-Custom-Shop-57-Stratocaster-1989-Aged-Olympic-White-Seafoam-Green-/123642639342", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bowling Green, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236426393428080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rb8AAOSwEP9cYwp2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/riMAAOSwl7pcYwqL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/P~8AAOSwQVlcYwqW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9BMAAOSw8yxcYwoo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KBAAAOSwhW1cYww4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kHoAAOSw8KRcYwxD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GmgAAOSw~6hcYwxL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/olEAAOSwFstcYwrg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "42103", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dandamantk", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 223, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 28, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 655.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 655.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 918}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Early Fender Custom Shop 57 Stratocaster 1989 Aged Olympic White/Seafoam  Green", "HitCount": 799, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1550218114", "StoreName": "Chromatone Music"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 665.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "For parts or repair", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
