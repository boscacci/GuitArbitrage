{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I'm moving some more gear; letting go of my Fender American Deluxe HSS strat. This guitar is from the American Deluxe Series made at the Corona Plant (Fender) in 2007. This is Fender's top of the line production guitar; you can check out all the specs online, but here are some highlights: LSR roller nut, locking tuners, SCN noiseless pickups, abalone fret dots, and rolled edges on the frets. The S1 switching gives plenty of tonal options for blues, rock, or whatever you want to play. This really is a beautiful guitar in what I think is called Olympic Pearl - the color combination looks stunning with the rosewood fretboard and tortoise pick guard. The frets are in fantastic shape. The LSR nut and locking tuners keep it in rock solid tune and it's a very versatile guitar. When I sold my Les Paul, the HSS configuration with the humbucker provided me the tones for heavier music. The noiseless pickups sound great, too. The only drawback is that I don't have the original pop in trem bar (very easy to replace), but I'll include a screw in arm that works. Also, the Fender case is in excellent condition, but I don't have the keys to lock it (the latches work well, they just don't lock without the keys). I partially covered the serial number to prevent any forgeries (I've heard of this happening). It's never been smoked around, never gigged, and never around any pets. S and H is $85 to the continental United States only, please. It well be professionally packaged and insured and shipped most likely by UPS ground. Please ask any and all questions and thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "323672080971", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T21:56:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T21:56:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Fender-American-Deluxe-Stratocaster-HSS-Case-/323672080971", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Benton, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236720809718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jEUAAOSwKtlcLjSa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BI4AAOSwsrlcLjSZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PV8AAOSweX5cLjSb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PqkAAOSwG6tcLjSZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-P0AAOSw8R9cLjSa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XsYAAOSwGWJcLjSc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kVcAAOSw8fRcLjSZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Zq8AAOSwMKFcLjSc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~LwAAOSwxFVcLjSd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HuQAAOSw1qhcLjSd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sRYAAOSw2bFcLjSb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "42025", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "btsiress", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 422, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 150}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS with Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster HSS"]}]}, "HitCount": 413, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 809.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
