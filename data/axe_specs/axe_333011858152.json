{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is a Gibson Les Paul Special \"SL\". This was refinished by me, I bought it when someone had tried to \"relic\" it and did it a real disservice. These were finished in poly which is difficult enough to remove. The color is \"Hemi orange\" lacquer with gloss clear on top. There were no structural issues with the neck or tenon, there was a small crack on top of the control area, it can be seen thru the lacquer a little bit when held at an angle or near the jack. Looks like it was dropped on the jack at some point. It is not very substantial but is visible. Between the volume knob and jack. There is 1 small little blemish near the stop tail, almost like a thumb print, not sure why, its not too visible. The lacquer chipped a little around the toggle cavity and the back cover, these have been spot touched up and might not be noticed if I didn't point it out. A few small areas around the tuners on the headstock face have some small chips, not a big issue but see photo's. There are some small nicks, swirl marks on the body, see the Photo's which also show a lot of dust. Nice overall paint & finish. Having said all that, it sounds fantastic, stays in tune forever, pretty heavy at close to 8lbs. The pickups I bought here on Ebay, they are Gibson embossed on the back side, was told they were early 80's. They sound terrific, every bit as good as my old Les Paul Custom. The pots are either Bourne or CTS, orange drop caps, probably a switchcraft jack. Comes with a slightly used Gibson Gig Bag see photo. THIS IS A TERRIFIC INSTRUMENT, A REAL PLAYER THAT LOOKS AS COOL AS IT PLAYS AND SOUNDS. JUST SET UP BY Space Guitar, of Cleveland, Ohio. PAYPAL ONLY/USA ONLY/LOWER 48-SHIPS UPS/FEDEX GROUND FOR A FLAT RATE OF $ 50.00 INSURED, WELL PACKED, 1-2 days from auction ending/payment received. With slightly used Gibson Gig bag.
