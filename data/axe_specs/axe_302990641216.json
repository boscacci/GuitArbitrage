This guitar has stayed in my climate controlled smoke-free recording studio its entire life. The brushed nickel hardware is showing some light patina consistent with a very lightly used guitar of its age. Finish is in excellent overall condition. The is one tiny nick (about 1/4\" long) in the paint on the top edge of the headstock as shown in the last photo. US buyers only please. Shipping within continental USA only.
