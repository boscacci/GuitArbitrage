{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Untitled Document 2J's PAWN & GUN DESCRIPTION: Pre-owned, thisESP LTD MH-250 is in nice overall condition. We are not the original owners of this guitar so there is a question that we cannot answer with certainty. That is whether this was a factory second / B stock guitar. The very tip (front side) of the guitar head seems to have been factory repaired. We noticed that the paint is not exactly the same and there looks to be a fracture crack on it. The thing is that the finish is seamless. There is absolutely no crack or change in texture and can barely be seen. Personally I think the guitar left the factory just like this. The rest of the guitar shows really nice with signs of light to moderate use. The back tip and back of the head shows the worst of it. The paint rubbed away at the tip of the head and there are some noticeable scratches below it on the edge. The finish of the rest of the guitar is nice and shiny with some random spots that are little bit less shiny from play. There are some very light scratches on the body's finish that can only be seen at the right angles.There is one flaw that is semi-serious; the body has a small chip that we have pointed out on the pictures. Please see pictures for a detailed view. The electronics sound / work great. Listing is for the guitar only, no accessories or case. Get it fast, save big! Don't miss out, we ship daily.
