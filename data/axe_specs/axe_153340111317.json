{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I'm selling my very first electric guitar, a rare ASAT Super custom creation from G&L. I am the guitar's only owner and have kept it in excellent condition. This instrument features a chambered mahogany body, gorgeous tobacco sunburst finish, ebony fingerboard, custom ASAT over-wound pickups with 42 and 43 gauge wire and black covers, G&L saddle lock bridge, rear mounted 3-way LP style selector, volume, tone, and knurled chrome knobs, Schaller chrome tuners, 3-ply Tortoise LP style pickguard, Tolex hardshell case, and original documentation. 1 5/8\" width at nut, 12\" neck radius, medium jumbo frets. According to G&L, the ASAT Super was inspired by the ASAT Junior which emerged from the G&L Custom Creations Department in 1998. The primary design goal of the ASAT Super was to bring substantially more girth to the bridge pickup for overdriven tones, while maintaining the characteristic sparkle of the ASAT Magnetic Field Design pickups and good balance between the output levels of the two pickups. ASAT Super shares neck pickup specifications with the G&L 20th Anniversary model, while the bridge pickup is more heavily wound with lighter gauge wire. To offset the increased impedance of the pickups and maximize available brightness, the wiring of the tone control was altered so that the capacitor would be effectively removed from the circuit when the potentiometer is in the wide-open position. The G&L saddle lock bridge was chosen to maximize power, sustain, and comfort.This is a used guitar, but I have taken very good care of it. There are no dings or scratches on the guitar and I have had it regularly tuned-up by professional luthiers. Original price was $2300.00 from American Guitar and Band in Saint Paul, MN. I will pack everything so that it arrives safely and will also provide tracking information, depending on delivery location and preferred shipping method. **Last two photos are of the same model guitar that someone posted online. I used them as they capture the depth and richness of the guitar's tobacco burst coloring.**", "ItemID": "153340111317", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T02:11:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T23:10:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-L-ASAT-Special-Custom-Creations-Tobacco-Burst-Limited-Edition-Only-58-Made-/153340111317", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533401113178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c7EAAOSwCWNcPRUt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RKoAAOSwZ2FcPRU6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bzMAAOSw851cPRU6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RYMAAOSwZ2FcPRWy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H90AAOSw8fRcPRVA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Xi8AAOSwKL5cPRVA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aLEAAOSw~TNcPRV-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yrYAAOSwW4tcPRXV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg2MjI=/z/8ZkAAOSwq6VcPRZD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njg0WDkxMg==/z/T-YAAOSw2zRcPRZJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53207", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hollyhoux1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 42, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 41}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G&L ASAT Special Custom Creations - Tobacco Burst (Limited Edition Only 58 Made)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ASAT Special"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 190, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
