{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I bought this guitar a few years ago new from a custom manufacturer (in China). I named her Cintia. I am its only owner. It was my primary guitar throughout high school and early on in college. I played a few gigs with it in college and spent many hours practicing with it. As a result, there are a few minor scratches on the body. There is a small dent in the back of the body from a belt buckle, which cracked the finish. The dent is about a quarter of an inch. There is also a spot behind the bridge where there is some residue from tape - I scratched as much of it off as I could (I had a picture of Cintia Dicker taped to the body). Also, the pickguard is still new, I NEVER took the plastic off of it (see picture). Overall it is in good condition. I intonated it using 10-46 gauge strings. I often used 11-50s, which worked fine too. I currently have it strung with 9-42s. No issues. I have the action as low as possible without there being too much fret buzz. I replaced the tune-o-matic bridge with a roller bridge, but everything else is original (I'll include the original bridge). It comes with a fake leather Fender strap and has been fitted with two gold tone strap locks to match the gold colored hardware. The strap is in bad shape and I would suggest using your own strap instead of that one. It's pretty hard for me to part ways with it, but I haven't really played guitar seriously since early college, and she's been collecting dust in my room for years now. I'll be going off to grad school next semester, might be moving after that, don't play too much anymore, and I could really use the money.", "ItemID": "123657950570", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T19:01:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-21T19:01:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Chinese-LP-Chibson-Left-Handed-/123657950570", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Northford, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236579505708080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hYwAAOSwJ8hcbvLW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LzoAAOSwh0NcbvLf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5BsAAOSwgs5cbvLj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Zn8AAOSwm79cbvLn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I6kAAOSws7FcbvL1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Wg8AAOSw6HJcbvL4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HucAAOSw-sNcbvL7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-JYAAOSwYu1cbvL~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xs0AAOSw9GdcbvMC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06472", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "75cinreds", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 56, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 236.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 236.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 962}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Chinese LP Chibson Left Handed", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 199, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 239.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
