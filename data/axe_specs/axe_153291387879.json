{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Electric Guitar Fender Telecaster Jim Adkins with NICE Hard Case LOOK !!! I don't see a model number on it, but from the research I did it appears to be the JA-90 Pre owned, but it appears to be in good condition, but I noticed the switch up at the front by itself is missing the knob tip. There are some scratches on it, but for the most part they are on the pick guard and the guard on the back. My boss looked at it and he said that the scratches are only on a protective film that can be peeled off though. Comes with the nice hard case you see in the pictures. Please see the pictures and click on them to see all of them and see them bigger. The item you see is the actual item you will receive if you purchase this from us. Just so you, know we bubble wrap our guitars and put paper and/or air pockets all around them in actual 300 lb. strength \"guitar\" shipping boxes we purchase from ULINE. We have sold many guitars on this site since I have been working here for the last 5 years. We are a pawn shop and I work in the ebay department. If you have ever viewed our listings you might have heard me say....\"I know very little about guitars\" That is the reason our description of guitars is usually short.If there is something you are not sure about please ask questions and I will try to find out the answer for you. Feel free to ask any questions. Be sure to see our other items and add us to your favorites list because we add new items often.
