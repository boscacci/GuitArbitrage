{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "-This baritone LTD FB-200 has a scale length of 27\" and is in kinda rough condition but absolutely rips and is super fun to play. The pickups are a combo of an 81 in the bridge and a HZ in neck position. I didnt even know HZ's came in active form but I have to say that having the switch in middle position with both engaged is unexpectedly amazing. A most satisfying tone ala the swedish metal tones...of course, with the preamp I'm using, but closer than any other guitar I have. -Right now it has an old set of strings and tuned to Drop A and I've been thinkin, for the next strings, maybe get slightly heavier, especially for the low if its to be A. -Currently, The only thing that maybe needs replacing are the pickup rings as they have some corner damage by Hulk Hogan cranking them down but in general this entire guitar is so solid that I haven't seen the need to replace anything. -Summary of condition: dings and dents, lots of surface wear, rusty pickup ring screws and damaged rings, undefeated in battle. Shipped quick with tracking.
