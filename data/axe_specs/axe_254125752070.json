{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This was my very first guitar. I bought this brand new and I am the original owner. This guitar is in excellent condition - I basically learned to play Van Halen and Rush on this when I was in 8th grade and it has been in its case more or less ever since (about 30 years!). The body is made of solid mahagony, the two humbuckers are the famous \"Pat.Nr.-stamped\" Dirty-Finger models with coil tap. The electrical layout is the same as on the hollow-version: 2x Volume and two Tone-controls and a 3-way switch for selecting the PickUps plus aditional coil-tab function. Nashville-bridge and TP-6 Finetune-tailpiece. The guitar has a medium-size neck and is rather lightweight, very fun to play. Comes in its original black hardshell case with red interior. There are minor scuffs (not scratches) on the body which you can't see unless you look very hard . The handle on the case was also repaired after popping off during a job relocation move. The low E tuning peg became very stiff to turn (most likely the bearing grease dried out) and I replaced the tuning machine gear drivers but I kept the original \"knobs\" to maintain that classic look (see updated photos). Other than that - it is in beautiful condition, sounds great, is setup with new strings and ready to go!", "ItemID": "254125752070", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T14:01:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T17:32:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1981-Gibson-ES-335S-Silverburst-Solid-Body-Electric-Guitar-/254125752070", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Newton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2541257520708080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4Njc=/z/9OgAAOSwoFNcTLVF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MzI=/z/I1oAAOSw64xcTLVN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UNQAAOSwiqBcTLVT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTMw/z/8poAAOSwFSNcTLVZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjIy/z/lp4AAOSwb-1cTLVe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjgz/z/fgAAAOSwSVNcTLVk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5OFgxNjAw/z/N5kAAOSwxrJcTLVp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FCYAAOSw6eRcTLVv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/R6EAAOSwEqVcTLV1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07860", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gridridder", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 54, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 166}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1981 Gibson ES-335S Silverburst Solid Body Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1981"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silverburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 107, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
