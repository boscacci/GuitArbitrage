{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a personal project that came out exactly how I wanted. Hopefully you like it too. The guitar was stripped and clear coated in natural. But being originally sunburst I decided to bring it back to it's original color, but mimicking the patina and age of 61 year old guitar. The guitar has been finished in a beautiful thin nitro finish that had been aged to look as a well played and loved instrument. It has the original first year non sticker narrow spaced neck PAF using the standard PAF bottom plates with added holes. see: The bridge pickup is a patent sticker t-top probably from the late 60 or early 70s. The rest of the wiring harness is original including cans switches and pots. All other hardware is new and aged. Kluson reissue tuners/ agedByrdland tailpiece no engraving as seen on some early ES 350T examplesNew aged knobsOriginal amber switch tipOriginal case, but beat up and painted black probably many years agoNew replica pickguard and bracketNew replica non wired ABR-1 I love how this guitar plays and sounds. Straight neck, nice neck angle and no breaks. There are 4 plugged holes on the top that I tried to conceal as much as possible during the restoration, but still visible.
