{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This almost 19 year old guitar was purchased from the original owner who never played it out of his house. It is in very good condition with 2 minor nicks, and very small amount of buckle worming, all shown in the pictures. Of course on very close inspection a few tiny indentations may be found. The case is the original with the signed, uninstalled pickguard, and original paperwork. The case has a few scuffs but in good condition. The combination latch is broken. I have purchased and will include with guitar a new replacement one with rivets and complete instructions on how to install. It has been cleaned, polished, fingerboard and frets have also been cleaned and conditioned. It has had a professional set up with of course new strings. It has been a long time but I have sold 20-30 high end guitars on ebay all satisfied buyers. NOTE: If shipping is less than $100, I will refund difference. NOTE: SHIPPING TO CONTINENTAL USA ONLY! If foreign bidder you must supply an address with in the continental USA and arrange shipping from there. Be aware 3 day return is from the time it reaches the address in the USA. NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS: I will accept bids but I will only ship to EBAY\u2019s Global Shipping Center. I have no idea how much those additional costs are so contact EBAY BEFORE BIDDING! BUT MY 3 DAY RETURN STARTS AT EBAT CENTER, NOT YOUR DESTINATION. I just shipped international with a very happy buyer, and guitars in the past that were shipped to Japan resulted in positive feedbacks. But those were shipped to addresses in the USA then someone forwarded to international buyer. DO NOT BID WITHOUT CHECK ADD\u2019L COSTS! NOTE: 3 DAY UNCONDITIONAL RETURN POLICY: Guitar may be returned for any reason with notice within 3 days of receipt. Once immediately returned and received in same condition as shipped a full refund will be issued.", "ItemID": "132923281082", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T12:07:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-19T01:32:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2000-Gibson-Les-Paul-Gary-Moore-Signature-Guitar-/132923281082", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hampstead, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329232810828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/m0AAAOSwFAtcFVI8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ep4AAOSwkAxcFVJg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CVEAAOSw~VBcFVKG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RQcAAOSwhfRcFVJe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/k8cAAOSwoDFcFVJj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KKQAAOSwcs1cFVJd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DnAAAOSwiSVcFVJh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xEQAAOSwbX1cFVKE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vg0AAOSwznxcFVKJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DX8AAOSwQwFcFVKK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/A8MAAOSwIqxcFVKC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XTwAAOSwAbxcFVKI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28443", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mmartorelli", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 624, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 2}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CO", "PA", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2000 Gibson Les Paul Gary Moore Signature Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}]}, "HitCount": 36, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
