{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2012EPIPHONE\"1962\" REISSUECRESTWOOD CUSTOMHi and thanks for looking.This is a fantastic guitar that was Made by Epiphone in 2012 as part of The \"1962\" Collection.There are NO cracks,breaks or repairs to this guitar.The neck is straight,the strings are set low,the frets are in great shape and everything works as it should.The guitar plays,sounds and looks fabulous.This tremolo tends to stay in tune better than a Bigsby for me.The guitar has been lightly used and has some light wear including swirls in the finish,light fades in the nickel hardware and some light scuffing on the back of the guitar at the bridge end that doesn't go through to the wood.Overall in great shape.Les paul was a fan of this style pickup and the modern versions are wound a little hotter than the vintage.So,the guitar has warm sweet tones with a little more treble edge and bite.This is the best way to get into one of these guitars without spending thousands of dollars.It includes the older Epiphone case in the photos that shows much more wear than the guitar but is still solid and protects the guitar.Please,see photos and click to enlarge before bidding. From Their Page: A Rare Epiphone ClassicThe \"1962\" Crestwood Custom has a historically correct Crestwood profile made from mahogany with a beautiful Cherry color finish. The mahogany neck features a rosewood fingerboard with pearloid oval inlays, 22 medium jumbo frets, and a 1960s SlipTaper\u2122. The pickguard is especially eye catching with a butterfly-shaped clear guard with a vintage style foil \u201cE\u201d.The reissue Epiphone Tremotone\u2122 tremolo bar was carefully redesigned and retooled to function and look exactly like the original but with subtle improvements to ensure that your Tremotone\u2122 will last much longer than vintage models.Epiphone, 1962In 1962, Epiphone had been part of the Gibson family of instruments for 5 years. The swing era was in the past.. Epiphone had already released great original instruments in those short 5 years including (future) Beatle favorites the Casino and Texan. But 1962 was the year that Epiphone truly distinguished itself with a line of unique instruments that firmly established its independence. Old models were improved and new models were more distinctive than ever. Visitors to the 1962 NAMM show saw an Epiphone line that was fully revitalized with an eye to the future. In two short years, the British Invasion would bring rock and roll in a big way and would also introduce electric blues to new audiences. Epiphone\u2019s 1962 releases kicked off an era during which Epiphone would became a favorite for a wide range of artists including Johnny Winter, Jimi Hendrix, John Lee Hooker, and The Hollies. Add The Beatles and The Rolling Stones to that mix and you can see why the \u201860s became Epiphone\u2019s second great era. Just like today, artists loved Epiphone\u2019s unique designs, great sound, and long history of affordable quality. The 1962 Collection is a long overdue look back at those instruments that put Epiphone back on the guitar map to stay.\"1962\" Crestwood Custom Specifications:Top Material:MahoganyBody Material:MahoganyNeck Material:MahoganyNeck Shape:1960's SlimTaper\u2122Neck Joint:Glued-InTruss Rod:AdjustableTruss Rod Cover:2-Layer (Black/White)Scale Length:24.75\"Fingerboard Material:Rosewood w/\"Pearloid\" Oval InlaysHeadstock:Dovewing 3-on-a-side w/\"Pearloid\" Dot InlayBridge Pickup:Epiphone Alnico Classic Mini-HumbuckerNeck Pickup:Epiphone Alnico Classic Mini-HumbuckerControls:Volume - Bridge Pickup, Volume - Neck Pickup, Tone - Bridge pickup, Tone - Neck Pickup, 3-way Toggle Pickup SelectorBinding Headstock:NoneBinding Body:NoneBinding Neck:NoneFingerboard Radius:12\"Frets:22;
