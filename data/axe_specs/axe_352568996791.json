{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "IBANEZ MC-824 DS MUSICIAN BASS 1984 Dark Stain MIJ fujigen Serial #: A841617 Wow! Have a look at this vintage mid 80's Ibanez MC-824 Musician bass! Dark Stain finish. MADE IN JAPAN. January 1984 Fujigen manufacture. Ash body, 5pc Maple/Walnut neck through body construction, 24F fretboard, Ibanez J6 humbucking pickup, and Tri-Sound switch! It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few marks, nicks, and scratches on it nothing that I found that I would call very significantly major and overall I'd say that it's in fine shape! Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the body and neck are camera flash and light reflection. Neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickup are in solid working condition as well. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds great! Big beefy tone and plenty of low end drive! I found it to be an excellent player! No gigbag. If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Shipping inside of the USA is $55 by USPS Priority Mail which is registered, insured, and trackable.
