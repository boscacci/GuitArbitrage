{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this Ovation Viper 1271 electric solid body guitar. Based on the serial number, the guitar was made between 1973-1975. This is one of the earliest versions of this model. Overall, the guitar is in good condition, but it does show signs of wear. The guitar looks, plays, and sounds great! There are plenty of small scratches and dings on the guitar, which is to be expected on a guitar that is 43+ years old. One of the tuning pegs was replaced with a newer gold tuner, but it does not appear as though any new holes were made when it was replaced. One of the other tuners is missing the back plate, but it works fine as is. The bottom part of the pickguard looks like it may have been modified at one point. There is a metal plate holding the output jack, which looks and works fine. This 24 fret guitar is very easy to play all the way up and down the neck. The pickups also sound very really good though any of my tube amps and the guitar is pretty versatile. Please feel free to ask any questions or make an offer!", "ItemID": "264042454178", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T19:58:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-15T21:05:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1973-1975-Ovation-Viper-1271-Vintage-Sunburst-Solid-Body-Electric-Guitar-24-Fret-/264042454178", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cathedral City, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640424541788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VjUAAOSwtxlb7d9s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DXIAAOSw5cZb7d9s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5LMAAOSw-HRb7d9s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AnoAAOSwAQVb7d9r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7fMAAOSwatBb7d9v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KYAAAOSwMO9b7d9u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HjAAAOSwORxb7d9v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/azsAAOSwdrdb7d9w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QRIAAOSwE~Zb7d9r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KT8AAOSwpwRb7d9v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FcsAAOSwyPFb7d9s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/l~sAAOSwwdNb7d9v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mydeadblues", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 215, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 548}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1973-1975 Ovation Viper 1271 Vintage Sunburst Solid Body Electric Guitar 24 Fret", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ovation"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 1706, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
