{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Epiphone Limited Edition Slash Appetite For Destruction Les Paul with Slash case. This is 1 of only 3000 made world-wide. Both in very good condition. Minor signs of use and wear on both (please see photos). This was a player's guitar. Action medium low and intonation is on the money. Neck is straight. Plays, looks, and sounds as good as any Gibson Les Paul I've owned. No pickguard was issued with this model. Fast playing Slash D-profile neck and sounds killer (Seymour Duncan Slash-designed pickups are amazing). Strung recently with Ernie Ball .009 - .042. I changed out the Wilkinson tuners for Grover Deluxe Vintage tuners because Grovers are about the best tuner you can buy and they look vintage Les Paul. Case has tape covered minor tear in tolex. Listing for guitar and case only. Stand not included. Any fan of the Guns N' Roses band, Slash, or wants a great Les Paul would be proud of to own this one!
