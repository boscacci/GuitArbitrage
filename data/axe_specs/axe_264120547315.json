{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Squier 51 custom guitar with 2 necks. Tele neck (original one) has had all frets removed professionally, glass smooth maple fretboard is fantastic for slide playing or to improve your playing by teaching you exactly where to place your fingers for the right note. Could be refretted easily enough too as long as you know what you're doing. Strat neck is from a squier standard, the good one and is fretted and in like new condition. It is the same scale and length as the tele one and will bolt right in should the fretless one prove to not be what you are after or could be used with a regular strat body to build a second guitar. Everything works as it should. Electronics are solid and pickups sound great. Tuners are smooth, nuts are in good shape. $30 flat rate shipping in continental US", "ItemID": "264120547315", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T02:15:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T02:15:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-51-custom-electric-guitar-telecaster-strat-2-necks-/264120547315", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Portland, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641205473158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4d8AAOSwMd1cMVlr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IskAAOSwj5BcMVlu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/klkAAOSwakJcMVlw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v2EAAOSwG49cMVly/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n04AAOSwqjhcMVl0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jIYAAOSwnh5cMVl2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EZ4AAOSwYwZcMVl4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2dUAAOSwb15cMVl6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/s04AAOSwhrpcMVl8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uV8AAOSwrfRcMVl-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "97230", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "graveltoothpick", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 889, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 13, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.26, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.26, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 14}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squier 51 custom electric guitar, telecaster, strat, 2 necks", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}]}, "HitCount": 630, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 151.76, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
