{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a gorgeous Hagstrom acoustic guitar. It has some of the most beautiful inlay work I have ever seen. It really produces a warm and beautiful sound, with a surprising amount of volume. There is a flowered vine that runs up the fret board from the sound hole all the way up to the 3rd fret. Below the bridge another flowered inlay that looks like it is growing outward. Please see the photos! They hardly do it justice. This guitar is in great condition. There are some pick scratches, but no serious issues at all. The model number is AMS-G2500. I have searched and scoured the internet, but have found no real information on this guitar. I found a few photos online, and even found a guitar with a similar vine running up the neck. But I never found one with the flowers below the bridge. This must have been an extremely limited run, as it is the most ornate Hagstrom I could find in this model number. I wish I could tell you the year, but Hagstrom acoustic guitars seem to be notoriously hard to date. Do a google search for yourself, and you'll see what I mean. I can't imagine this guitar being more than 10 years old. It just doesn't look like a very old guitar. But since I could find no real info on their serial numbers, I cannot say for sure. This comes with a great hardshell case with very little wear. Will ship only within the continental USA.
