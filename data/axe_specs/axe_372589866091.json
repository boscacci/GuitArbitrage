The streamlined alder Strat body is adorned with chrome control plates and a tortoiseshell Jaguar pickguard, adding a blaze of style thats for the bold. Sounding as killer as it looks, this instrument has everything that made you fall in love with both guitars. We didnt just take visual cues from the Jaguar; we took its agile switching system and melded it with Strat electronics to create a uniquely powerful hybrid system. The traditional 5-way switch is joined by a dedicated thumbwheel tone control for the bridge pickup while dual upper bout switches allow position 3 to select either the middle pickup alone, or all 3 pickups at once for a powerful blast of tone. The matched set of vintage-style single-coil Jaguar pickups are as period-correct as possible and have the authentic sound of the 60s. The 25.5-scale maple Jaguar neck sports a Deep C profile, along with a 9.5-radius rosewood fingerboard and 22 narrow-tall frets for enhanced playability, along with a bone nut. Other elegant touches include a locking tremolo with screw-in arm, polished chrome-plated Mustang bridge saddles, Jaguar knobs, deluxe locking all-short-post tuning machines and Limited Edition neck plate. An arresting guitar with graceful contours, the Jaguar Strat was born to do one thingmake the scene in style. Includes a hardshell case and Certificate of Authenticity.
