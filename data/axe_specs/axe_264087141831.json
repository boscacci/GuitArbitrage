{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a very rare vista series Jagmaster made in Japan. The Vista series is very rare as it was only produced for 2 years, in 1996 &1997, which makes this guitar a collectible to avid collectors. The Japanese Squiers made by Fender are the ones with the most excellent craftsmanship and are highly sought after for their rarity and high quality. They are made of heavy and high quality materials not the cheap ones like they do now. Custom Modified bridge , 2 custom Seymour Duncan humbucker pickups , one pearly gates, one distortion, and custom Schaller tuners made in Germany to replace the vintage tuners (over $400 extra in mods combined), these produce an unmatched versatile sound, this thing absolutely rocks and screams ! Best sound ever . Cosmetic wear and tear looks like a relic , which gives it character, needs a small fix on the input where the cable goes in for connection, you will need to do this in order for it to produce sound, but it's very simple fix and only a $15 fix or can do yourself, I didn't have time to take it in- have to sell asap hence the low price. So get this truly incredible guitar for an absolute steal for a quick fix yourself or a short trip to the local guitar shop. The sunburst is absolutely gorgeous and the neck is much better quality than Fenders that are produced today, it is also gorgeous, smooth, and has great wood detail. I love this guitar! Had for 10 years , really sad I have to sell it, this thing is a dream. Starting bid is super cheap for this guitar it's ridiculous! NO RESERVE . ONLY 24 HOURS LEFT! Good luck *only shipping to the US contiguous 48 states", "ItemID": "264087141831", "EndTime": "2018-12-14T22:57:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T22:57:45.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-Jagmaster-Rare-1997-Vista-Series-Japan-Guitar-Custom-Jaguar-NR-/264087141831", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pacific Palisades, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640871418318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ucQAAOSwEp5cEYsK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dWUAAOSwuNNcEbqp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MDUAAOSwwXRcEbrV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I24AAOSwukZcEcTG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/MYYAAOSwt~1cEYsf/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eAoAAOSwqnlcEciP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/3k4AAOSwfplcEcTy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7CUAAOSwXMxcEYge/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDM0/z/zL0AAOSw8DpcEciC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pOIAAOSwVCpcEYgr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X2EAAOSwuJRcEbqR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L-oAAOSwHGxcEbqi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90272", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "themellowcellar", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 94, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 285.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 285.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 395}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squier Jagmaster Rare 1997 Vista Series Japan- Guitar Custom - Jaguar- NR", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Vista"]}]}, "HitCount": 104, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 290.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
