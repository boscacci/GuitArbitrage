{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 2008 Rickenbacker 660 in mint condition and in perfect working order. The solid maple body sports a gloss nitro lacquer Mapleglo finish that highlights the ripples of curly flame figuring on both of the body wings, accented by checkerboard binding and classic gold Rickenbacker dual pickguards and truss rod cover. The toaster pickups deliver a chime, balance, and fullness that is classic Rickenbacker, and these single coils truly do boast a unique vintage tone. Weighing in at 7lbs on the dot and very resonant acoustically, this guitar is the perfect instrument for the player that wants a visually alluring instrument with great playability and a versatile range of Ric tones. Professionally dialed in here at Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar with a few small tweaks beyond the scope of the factory setup, this Ric 660 is strung with fresh 10-46 strings, and we've setup the instrument for optimal action and solid intonation.The neck has a notably spacious 1 3/4\" nut which provides the ideal width for players that need a bit more room to navigate the fretboard. The profile is a comfortable medium D with an extremely smooth gloss nitro lacquer finish, rosewood fretboard and triangle inlays that stretch all the way to the fretboard edges, just like the Rickenbackers of the '60s. The neck thru construction of this guitar is a hallmark of the Rickenbacker tone, with a sustain, stability, and elegance that few guitars can match. The stock frets are unplayed with perfectly rounded crowns and zero wear. The dual truss rod design is capped by a gold \"Rickenbacker\" cover and the Ric Deluxe tuning machines all have flawless chrome plating.On the body, all of the electronics work as they should, with individual Volume and Tone controls for each pickup, with Rickenbacker's unique fifth knob blend control for a smooth gradient between the tone of the two pickups. The chrome hardware on the body is flawless, and given the natural Mapleglo finish, Rickenbacker typically reserves their most figured woods for these models. The maple on both sides of the neck thru central section displays ripples of tight curly flame, very three dimensional in nature and a bit more varied than the straighter, tigerstripe figuring often seen on 660s. In terms of cosmetic wear, we can't find a scratch on the guitar. While clearly not a new instrument given the 2008 manufacture date, it's showroom clean and a pristine example that's professionally setup and ready to be played!The original hardshell case and case candy are included.
