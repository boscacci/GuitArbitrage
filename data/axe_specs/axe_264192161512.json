{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Paul Reed Smith 2015 PRS S2 semi hollowbody Whale Blue American made. Condition is Used. This is a light weight great sounding versatile guitar that was my main thing for a few years. Plays great with coil tapping push pull volume knobs. I recently upgraded to a much more expensive PRS and this just doesn't get played much anymore. There are a few dings in the finish that I tried to get a good photo of and there is some flaking on the underside of the neck around the 12-14th fret but this is unnoticeable when playing. I have had many people tell me this was the best top they have seen on an S2, absolute gorgeous guitar. Please feel free to ask any questions if you need specific information.
