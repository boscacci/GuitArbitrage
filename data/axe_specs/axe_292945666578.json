{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale here is a 1987 les paul custom in finely and naturally aged alpine white. She became a 3 pickup by a previous owner and was professionally done. so not an original 3 pickup. I bought the guitar and did all the hardware/pickups/wiring over for the look it has now which I think is very cool. Unfortunately i really never play it and I am not a museum guy I play my standard 100 percent of the time. so I am \"flipping\" my creation. Guitar plays well with nice low action comfortably over the refret, which was done with low/narrow fretwire. New frets are laid over the binding FYI which i personally like for the extra real estate it gives on the high and low E strings. Pickups- neck is a brandonwound T-TOP replica, middle is a 57 classic with the A2 mag swapped for a rough cast A5, and the bridge is an old DImarzio PAF ( 70's early 80's) that has great tone. I never use Dimarzio personally but this one won the tone test hands down. The 3 way switch is actually a 6 way Freeway Switch which adds several useful pickup combos to take advantage of the 3 pickups. I have a schematic that explains the wiring setup . Tuners are planet waves trim lock locking tuners that trim the string ends off as you tighten. Best tuners EVER. Hardware is gotoh locking tailpiece and bridge which really does enhance sustain/tone. original grover tuners and tailpiece and bridge are included. Quality Epiphone non original hardshell case included. No breaks/warps/repairs and the frets have 80 percent life left. If you look at the back of the headstock that is a finish only crack and was confirmed by my repair guy who did the wiring it is NOT structural just finish. Giver her a good home!", "ItemID": "292945666578", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T11:40:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-03T13:27:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom-1987-/292945666578", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "North Chelmsford, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929456665788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~rwAAOSwE6NcVuXC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NfYAAOSwA3xcVuXW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/n2oAAOSwaeNcVuXi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gt4AAOSwfqJcVuXp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ctYAAOSw27lcVuXy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "01863", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pooch5504akh", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 598, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.8}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "BH", "HR", "MY", "PA", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Custom 1987", "HitCount": 1300, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "excellent condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
