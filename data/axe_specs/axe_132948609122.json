{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Offered is a made in Korea Squier Strat from 1992. Pearl white (the light beige-ish white), one-piece maple neck. This is a great guitar, but it is 27 years old and has all the nicks and scratches that go along with that. Everything works...it looks like the pickguard has been replaced (1-ply, but it has a beveled edge, I think these originally had a straight edge), and the back plate also is not original. Also, it is MISSING the whammy bar. If these imperfections and signs of use bother you, this is not the guitar for you. Know what you are getting, and if you have any questions at all, please ask before bidding. Also, I'm happy to take returns if something goes amiss (sometimes something goes amiss), but I do not give partial refunds EVER. An increasing number of buyers have tried to \"extort\" me after the sale. I stand behind every guitar, and I stand behind every sale. Check my feedback, you have absolutely nothing to worry about, but I will absolutely not negotiate price after a sale. That's about it....playable Vintage...from Maggie's Farm!", "ItemID": "132948609122", "EndTime": "2019-02-18T01:15:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-11T01:15:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squier-Strat-Made-Korea-1992-Vintage-Stratocaster-/132948609122", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Huntington, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329486091228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sH8AAOSwIxVcYIZ5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zL0AAOSwDNZcYIaJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VucAAOSwq5dcYIaP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j2wAAOSwCR9cYIaV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pAQAAOSwdfVcYIac/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FDgAAOSwinlcYIai/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aO0AAOSwHGFcYIar/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc1WDE2MDA=/z/g58AAOSw24hcYIaC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11743", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mystereman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3171, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 149.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1185}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squier Strat -- Made in Korea, 1992 - Vintage Stratocaster", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 441, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 151.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
