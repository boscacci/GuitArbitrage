{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Squier Stratocaster with Roadworn Relic finish and hardware. Great 60's vibe with vintage style Fender logo decal on headstock and retro \"Record Girl\" pinup decal on bout. This is a nice, 25 year old vintage Strat, built in 1994. The neckplate on the body has a seril # prefix of NC4, indicating that it was made in the highly regarded Yako factory in Taiwan. These are much sought after by collectors for their quality and ability to accept American and Mexican hardware (Full block bridge trems, etc). It plays and sounds great. Authentic style relic wear. Neck Is nice - chunkier than typical modern Squiers and minimal visible fret wear and amber vintage finish. Kluson style vintage tuners and vintage style bridge saddles. The body is full Stratocaster thickness at 1 3/4\" - just like American, MIM & MIJ Strats. Many modern Squiers, such as Bullets and Affinitys have thin bodies. Aged pickguard and pickup covers. Killer relic finish on headstock. This Strat looks like a 50 year old time traveler. The guitar plays nicely as built but you may want to set it up to your preferences. This Strat would also make a great platform for customization. Great guitar for decor also. Please see pics. Here's an opportunity to own / mod your own custom relic Strat for a fraction of the cost of a Fender Custom Shop guitar. I've tried to describe the guitar as best and thoroughly as I can, but I'm not an expert but sold as is since it is relic'd. So please feel free to ask any questions. Shipping to Continental U.S. only.
