{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The DeArmond by Guild Starfire \u201cSpecial\u201d. Very good used condition. A couple dials are missing the foil \"D\" on top, a few dings and scratches visible, especially on the back. These semi-hollowbody DeArmond Specials are highly regarded for their build quality, and if you\u2019ve played one or read the forums online from people who have, you know they're heavy, but totally deliver the goods on sustain, tone and playability, like nothing else in their price range. Low, easy playing string action. This model features Grover-style enclosed tuners and DeArmond branded Bigsby tremolo. The pickups are the DeArmond model 2000, first used on the Gretsch Electromatics of the 1950s, and then on the original 1961 Guild Starfire. They produce shimmering clarity, bite and/or plenty loud roar. This guitar sounds magnificent played through an amplifier modeling device on all variety of settings. Crafted in Korea, 1999. The basic black plastic pick guard has been removed, because it seems perfunctory on an instrument of this much inherent beauty and effortless power. But that\u2019s included in the sale, along with a guitar strap and a Road Runner padded gig bag to carry this versatile, expressive powerhouse tone monster. I have two, and plan to keep my other one. $50 Economy shipping to Continental U.S.$100 to Alaska or HawaiiInternational shipping costs, and all related duties, taxes and fees, not included.", "ItemID": "173643058373", "EndTime": "2018-11-25T22:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-15T22:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/DeArmond-Guild-Starfire-Special-crafted-Korea-1999-Roadrunner-gig-bag-/173643058373", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Brooklyn, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736430583738080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/awcAAOSwBMpb7TzY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/T9EAAOSwXItb7TzY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2R8AAOSwEVlb7TzY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OhMAAOSwo3Fb7TzZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4-sAAOSwsO5b7TzY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M9UAAOSw~bhb7TzX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XLAAAOSwTVlb7Tza/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sXkAAOSwi3xb7TzY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9LEAAOSwAuJb7Umq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11215", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mhpalermo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 555, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "DeArmond by Guild Starfire \"Special\" crafted in Korea 1999 + Roadrunner gig bag.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Guild"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["DeArmond by Guild"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Starfire &quot;Special&quot;"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 143, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
