{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is this cool 1960s ES 125 project. It is sold as is, and everything shown the it pics is included. Basically, just the body and neck with a set of non-original tuners. This was a working guitar when I received it, and it sounded great. As you can see in the pics, there is lots of finish checking, but there are no cracks in the body. There are some signatures on the back of the body, but I'm not sure who. According to the previous owner, the headstock was cracked and repaired over 25 years ago, and has been stable ever since. Please look closely at the pics. This would be a great start to your next custom guitar build. I am listing other parts from this guitar. I will gladly combine shipping. Shipping to USA & Canada only. No duty or tax to either destination.", "ItemID": "332857151788", "EndTime": "2018-11-05T02:10:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T02:10:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1960s-Gibson-ES-125-Body-Neck-Project-/332857151788", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kenora, Ontario", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328571517888080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HA8AAOSwsupb1eDd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rTUAAOSwNptb1eDv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fboAAOSwmUFb1eCc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5U8AAOSwBYFb1eER/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f5UAAOSwaalb1eCs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f5IAAOSwElxb1eC2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OwgAAOSwHgRb1eC~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3TcAAOSw2YZb1eDJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CHMAAOSwhyRb1eDR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-IIAAOSwDDRb1eDd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Tz8AAOSwC~Bb1eDl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "p9n 1c1", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "strat_parts", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1456, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.9}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 93}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1960s Gibson ES-125 Body & Neck Project", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 369, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 504.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
