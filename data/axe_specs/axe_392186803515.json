{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding starts at a penny with no reserve Beautiful Mint Pre-Fender Westerly made Guild X-160 in the coveted Blonde finish with original hard case and the exceptional pre-fender Guild HB1 humbuckers which are the same pickups used in the Guild Nightbird X2000 and the Nightingale--when Fender bough Guild in 1994 they soon produced their own version of the iconic HB1s which are decent pickups but these late 80s to early 90s HB1s are as good as any humbucker ever made in my estimation--especially for blues and jazz but with the right pedals and amp setting they will totally rock without feedback because of the semi hollow design. This one is essentially perfect and for 26 year old guitar is amazingly well-preserved. And apparent anomalies are reflections from either flash or sunlight--there are virtually no play marks on the guitar--frets are excellent as is the board--neck angle perfect and the truss rod has lots of room for adjustment. The guitar was just set up and intonated and has new strings prior to offering it for sale. the joy is to play it. This is really an exceptional beauty. please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value--i will not make money on shipping--ever-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392186803515", "EndTime": "2018-12-12T02:30:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T02:30:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1993-Guild-guitar-X-160-blond-dead-mint-pre-fender-w-HB1s-pups-USA-/392186803515", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Port Townsend, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3921868035158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE4WDE2MDA=/z/kLUAAOSw4vpcBzX4/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2NlgxNjAw/z/6HIAAOSwHAxcBzYB/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tDoAAOSwIKNcBzYN/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NzU=/z/QbIAAOSwOt5cBzYZ/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDA4/z/HHoAAOSwaiBcBzYl/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3ODA=/z/IuMAAOSwVP5cBzYu/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDk4/z/18kAAOSwypZcBzY5/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDM1/z/UzEAAOSwzTFcBzZF/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI3MlgxNjAw/z/qRgAAOSwEppcBzZU/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2MFgxNjAw/z/raoAAOSwPrtcBzZg/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4IsAAOSwEJ1cBzZz/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "98368", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "glemons3p26", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3694, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 24, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 962.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 962.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 20}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1993 Guild guitar X 160 blond dead mint pre-fender w HB1s pups USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Guild X-160"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1993"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood", "Laminate"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Guild"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 314, "Subtitle": "offers considered until first bid is placed", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 972.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM", "RU", "AL", "AD", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "EE", "FI", "GG", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LT", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "SJ", "UA", "VA", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "offers considered until first bid is made--please see item description as well as scans--", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
