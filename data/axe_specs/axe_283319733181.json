Photos are part of the item description. Please look at them closely. We make every effort to describe our items accurately, but occasionally we may miss something. Please allow us the respect to try to correct a problem before filing a case with eBay. We reserve the right to end this auction at any time due to the item also being for sale locally. Payment is expected within three days of auctions end after which a non-paying bidder case will be opened because of the unfortunate rise of non-paying bidders. It is rude and selfish behavior and not fair to both seller and other potential buyers. We do combine shipping if you buy more than one of our items. Just send us a message with the items you want a shipping quote on and we will send you a quote. Shipping costs are given for the CONTINENTAL US only. Alaska & Hawaii costs more Please ask for quote. We do not make money on shipping. We ship primarily USPS flat rate envelope, which USPS sets the cost at $6.65 or $7.20 for a padded envelope. Add the cost of paper, tape and expensive printer ink and we might break even occasionally. EBay also charges sellers a 9% fee in shipping costs as well as their exorbitant final value fees. Buyer pays for all return shipping. Feedback is important to us, so if there is a problem with your purchase, please contact us and we will work it out to both our satisfaction. Positive feedback will be given when positive feedback is received.
