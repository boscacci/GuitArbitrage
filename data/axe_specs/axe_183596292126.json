{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "It's time once again for my annual holiday guitar sale. Lot's of people look forward to this each year, so here we go. You are looking at a Japanese made Ibanez by Team J Craft Prestige model electric guitar, that was made in Japan. This is a pretty rare model you don't see around often. Color is a black base with tiny orange wires that look like orange metal flake. Looks amazing under a magnifying glass. It has black chrome hardware with factory Ibanez tremolo, that is similar to a Floyd Rose or Kahler. Body has some nicks along the edges, and looks like someone had some fun playing it. The fretboard has a couple dents in the wood along the edge of the 6th string, and the back of the neck has a bunch of small impressions like it was leaned against something with an edge. Finish is not broken, and you really don't feel them, but just want to make the buyer aware. These were typically played by heavy metal users, and they really like to bend those strings, and get crazy on stage. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a cool and collectible guitar, that is sure to keep going up in value. Each year I sell off the high end guitars that we have acquired at our pawn shop during the year, and they have been sold to almost every country in the world. We only sell quality products, and our feedback will back that up. All will be sold on a no reserve basis, and no auctions will be closed early or with a buy it now, so bid to buy. Thanks for looking, and please check out my other auctions too.", "ItemID": "183596292126", "EndTime": "2018-12-27T17:49:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-20T17:49:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Prestige-Team-J-Craft-orange-metal-flake-comes-w-factory-hard-case-/183596292126", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Riverside, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835962921268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/oPsAAOSwgb1cG9P5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/lP0AAOSwgcdcG9Pc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/-ukAAOSwHGJcG9Pq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/DYAAAOSwJ9dcG9P1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/B98AAOSwzZNcG9Pj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/Ny8AAOSwQXlcG9P1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/R1oAAOSwp3dcG9P2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/0~wAAOSwRfxcG9Pu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/aZEAAOSw64xcG9P7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/puYAAOSw2~NcG9Pu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/f5oAAOSwIABcG9Pl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/pUsAAOSwZ2tcG9Pc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92506", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "inlandjandl", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 691, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 33, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 421.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 421.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "8***z", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 831}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Prestige by Team J Craft in orange metal flake,comes w/factory hard case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["prestige"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 1063, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 426.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
