{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender telecaster Special KOA body, maple Birdseye neck. Rosewood fretboard. Brass saddle to really make her dance. I have had this baby for 6 years. Used mostly for recording and a few shows here and there. But no road wear and tare. She really is a beauty in person. So why am I selling? I have converted.... recently I began playing a Stratocaster and now I\u2019m just hooked and this beauty just isn\u2019t getting any love. So I\u2019m looking to sell her and get another Strat for a back up on stage. Too many teles and too little strats. She plays like a dream and the action is perfect! Always in tune also. The only imperfection she has is a hairline crack in the finish on the headstock. I had it looked at when I purchased the guitar used 6 years ago and I was told that it was nothing to be concerned about and I haven\u2019t thought about it again until mentioning it now just for full disclosure sake. It honestly can\u2019t even be seen unless you shove it in your face. I\u2019m not interested in trades. I mean unless you have a Gibson J200 you want to trade lol. * hard case in pictures not included. Fender soft gig bag pictured is included.", "ItemID": "302972375453", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T02:45:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-25T19:02:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-telecaster-KOA-Special-Edition-/302972375453", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bayport, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029723754538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X7EAAOSwEOJb-u3R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RH0AAOSwZtRb-u5a/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WdEAAOSwvL1b-u3C/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aQsAAOSwnfRb-u5r/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yfYAAOSw29Jb-u4O/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PycAAOSwWz5b-u4K/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JVMAAOSwwSJb-u56/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZmkAAOSwJaxb-u69/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11705", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "shuren1717", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 236, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 715.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 715.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 739}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender telecaster KOA Special Edition ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Koa"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Special"]}]}, "HitCount": 238, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
