{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FENDER QUALITY AT A GREAT PRICE! PROFESSIONALLY SERVICED and READY TO PLAY!! This is a Squier by Fender Model '51 Electric Guitar. The '51 is one of the few original designs offered under the SQUIER Trade Mark. The guitar is 100% Original and complete. There are a few light marks that include scuffs and scratches. For the most part, NEAR MINT. It is in perfect structural condition. It comes with the gig bag case you see in the pictures. Features include: Chrome hardware, sealed tuners, 21 fret maple neck w/ dot markers, one single coil neck pickup, one double coil humbucker bridge pickup, 3 way pickup switch (no tone control), master volume control with push/pull bridge PU coil tap, single ply black pick guard, cream blonde finish body. The set up on this guitar is awesome, nice and low. The truss rod works as it should, neck is straight. All the electronics work as they should (no scratchy pots). Frets and finger board look new. Back of the neck is perfectly smooth. I have completely serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the body and neck, cleaned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the frets, installed new strings (Ernie Ball Regular Slinky 10-46's), tweaked the neck truss rod, adjusted the bridge and intonation, etc. I spend as much time and what ever it takes to make guitars play and perform as good as they possibly can. I can honestly say this guitar plays better than most new ones. DON'T MISS IT!! Buyer pays $29.95 shipping, insurance, PACKAGING and HANDLING to the contiguous 48 states. Items over 2 lbs will ship Fed Ex ground, (no PO Boxes). Please take a look at the last picture and my other listings.
