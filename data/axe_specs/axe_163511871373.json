{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1955 Les Paul Special. Blues Guitar that has \"Paid Its Dues.\" A 1955 Les Paul Special that has really \"Paid its Dues\". Not Original, but a really uniques quitar.When I bought this guitar in 1969 it looked ancient. The TV Yellow finish was cracked with age, looking like a Byzantine Fresco. The Fingerboard had been changed to have the same style fingerboard as a Les Paul Standard.It had the wrong type pickups and the neck was warped. In 1970 I had it worked on to make it playable.The DeArmond flat pickups were replaced with the correct soapbox pickups, although they were the ivory colored ones rather than the original color black ones.I chose the ivory colored ones because I was told that kind was older. That was the color put on the first 1952 Les Paul. Later I discovered that electrically they were the same and they sound identical. If someone wishes they can get black covers with which to replace the ivory covers.As there was difficulty straightening the neck I had it shave down to where it was flat. One or two of the inlays on the high end were replaced. Of course it was refretted. I liked the look so I left it the same. The electronics were gone through and replaced where necessary. It has a phenomenal early rock or blues sound (As of the last time it was played. My amp is broken and it hasn't been played in several years). It plays good but not great. If you want it to play like a new guitar it will need another refret and a bit of neckwork. It is sold as-is and cannot be returned. Check the pictures very carefully. If you have any questions please contact me.On Jan-28-19 at 15:18:25 PST, seller added the following information: The case is also original.", "ItemID": "163511871373", "EndTime": "2019-02-04T02:35:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-28T02:35:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1955-Les-Paul-Special-Blues-Guitar-has-Paid-Its-Dues-/163511871373", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Carthage, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635118713738080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/c98AAOSwIABcTmd5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vX8AAOSwxHlcTmd7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/l8sAAOSwpzRcTmd9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yb0AAOSwZNtcTmd~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6gEAAOSwzFhcTmeB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/VRMAAOSwdj1cTmeD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/wP8AAOSwQLVcTmeE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/k-EAAOSwA3xcTmeG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VvgAAOSwDEBcTmeI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XqAAAOSwvcFcTmeK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wLEAAOSw8U9cTmeM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "28327", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cvwiikarl1453", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 297, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 8, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4056.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4056.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 350}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1955 Les Paul Special.
