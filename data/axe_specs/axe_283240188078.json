{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Strat. This started out as a early 1980s Seiwa guitar, made in Japan by Ibanez I believe. Solid wood body, not sure what type but it has a little heft, it is definitely not plywood. Has a Maple neck. The headstock has been reshaped to resemble the classic Strat, as well as the decal and was oversprayed with nitro. It has MIM Fender bridge/saddle setup. The wiring, pickups, selector are all original to the guitar to the best of my knowledge as well as the neck plate, which has a nice low 0888 serial number. Plays great, has good sounding pickups, 3 way selector switch. Also comes with the original Seiwa hard case. Has bumps and bruises, some scrapes around the trem, it\u2019s just a cool old guitar that plays well & people who know what they are tend to keep them, I just never play it anymore. USA shipping only. Feel free to ask any questions and I\u2019ll do my best to answer!", "ItemID": "283240188078", "EndTime": "2018-11-09T00:56:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-02T00:56:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Japan-MIJ-Seiwa-Ibanez-Strat-Electric-Guitar-Hsc-/283240188078", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "McMinnville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832401880788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F6cAAOSwCgNbtrRy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7hkAAOSwhh9btrR1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7~sAAOSw6~VbtrR3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ee0AAOSwKEhbtrR5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZJwAAOSwHctbtrR7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/V7AAAOSwoW1btrR9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8IgAAOSwu7xbtrR~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/w~MAAOSwOrpbtrSC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jB4AAOSwo7ZbtrSE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X9MAAOSw61FbtrSF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XWIAAOSwa9BbtrSI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DTsAAOSwme1btrSL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37110", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "natowright", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 365, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 582}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Japan MIJ Seiwa By Ibanez Strat Electric Guitar As Is With Hsc", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 159, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 255.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
