{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Late 90s Danelectro Bass Guitar 34\" Scale Overall this bass is in very good-excellent condition no serious fret or finger board wear & the neck has no bows or twists. It plays very nicely thanks to the slim profile of the neck & it is light.weight The bridge plate looks bowed which I have tried to show in the pictures. but it was difficult to get a good shot It was like this new & with the saddles adjusted correctly it doesn't seem to be an issue. I have included a new Fender style bridge in case the purchaser wants to change it. The binding tape on the body was coming up near the neck socket but has been re-glued but it split in the process. The toggle switch doesn't seem to make any real difference in the tones or sound 6 position pickup selector Combination tone & volume potentiometer.
