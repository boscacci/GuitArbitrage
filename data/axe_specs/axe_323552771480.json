{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here we have a vintage 1968 or 1969 Gibson Les Paul case for the 1968/69 Goldtop or Custom models. This was the more expensive form fit case option given at the time. In very good condition. Has only a couple nicks or dings in the tolex. Small tear in the tolex at the head stock end bottom edge( as seen in one pic). This is the next level of cases produced after the 50\u2019s style latches and replaced with improved clasps at the time. Has the rare \u201cBRUCE \u201c stamped on the handle. Also does not have any evidence of the Gibson logo which was later stamped on the cases in 1969. All of the metal hardware is intact and much of the brass luster is intact. All of the clasps are intact ( etched with the Excelsior name on each) and snap shut tight. One of the handle brackets is bent or pulled upward but the rivets are fully intact and safe to carry the guitar. The interior is super clean and void of any stains, mildew or abnormal smells( just the smell of old lacquer from the guitar as it housed a 1968 Goldtop). The accessory pocket lid ribbon has frayed away but lid is functioning fine. Please email me with any questions prior to bidding. No returns accepted.
