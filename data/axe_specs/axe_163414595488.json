{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a nice Patriot from '87. I haven't owned it very long, it was an impulse puchase and I don't have room for it. It's a really neat guitar, small and lightweight. 24-3/4\" scale. Everything appears original except the knobs which are newer generic speed knobs. There are some small dent marks on the back of the neck and the usual worming on the back of the body. The frets have some wear, but not too bad, and the finish on the fretboard is intact. There is a dent on the back edge of the headstock and just opposite on the front some finish is gone as well as a small portion of the decal on the edge. The pickups sound great. You can get some great tones from these. The volume pot isn't scratchy, the selector switch feel good but the tone pot is not effective for some reason. The pickguard is pretty scratched. The strings are the ones that came on it, so they are probably pretty old. The neck is straight and setup with minimal relief. The nut is in good shape also. Will be shipped in a new generic hardshell case.
