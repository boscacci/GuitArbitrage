You are looking at a 2018 Fender Jim Adkins JA-90 Telecaster Thinline. A collaboration between Jim Adkins and Fender, the Jim Adkins JA-90 Telecaster Thinline is a re-creation of Adkins' old TC-90 - with some special touches specifically for this new model. The Jim Adkins JA-90 Telecaster Thinline's semi-hollow ash body is joined to a set maple neck with a rosewood fingerboard - a great combination that produces a warm tone with a nice edge. Pickups are Seymour Duncan soapbars, and a Adjusto-matic bridge with anchored tailpiece round out the hardware. The Jim Adkins JA-90 Telecaster Thinline is a sweet axe for any style! From The Web: Fender Jim Adkins JA-90 Telecaster in Crimson Red Transparent This popular Tele, the JA-90, is now offered in a new Crimson Red Transparent finish. The Jim Adkins Tele JA-90 is very specifically crafted to suit the Jimmy Eat World frontman's sound. The combination of a semi-hollow body and Seymour Duncan soapbars means a classic look with modern nuances. Jim Adkins says... \"I used the prototype [of this guitar] to track most of our new album. Probably not a first guitar, but definitely in the zone of a second guitar; someone wanting to move up from their starter guitar. The sound is more single cutaway Deluxe than Tele, but the Seymour-Duncan pickups make it unlike them both as you're used to it.\" Here's what Fender say about the Jim Adkins JA-90 When Jim Adkins, guitarist and frontman for platinum-selling Jimmy Eat World, cheerfully challenged Fender with designing his perfect guitar, a collaboration began that resulted in the new JA-90. We sat down with Adkins and went over his old Fender TC-90 spec by spec, making some important changes that subsequently produced this unique new model. Features include a mahogany neck set into a semi-hollow ash body, Seymour Duncan soapbar pickups, independent volume and tone controls, an Adjusto-Matic bridge and anchored tailpiece.
