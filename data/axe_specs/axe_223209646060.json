{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This listing is for a Jay Turser JT-200 Pro Electric Guitar. It is a Gibson Les Paul knockoff and is in good condition. It needs new strings, though the ones that are currently on there seem to stay in tune pretty well. Some of the tuning posts are a little loose but it doesn't affect intonation at all. The 3-way pickup switch is also loose but it doesn't affect functionality at all. The guitar is fully functional and sounds good even through a practice amp. The guitar also comes in a Rockbag that is designed to fit the guitar's body. It's a very nice case with no flaws that I'm aware of. It has a few pockets and has a hard-body shell that does a great job protecting the instrument. This auction begins at $100. Other than the case, the guitar comes with NO accessories, cables, straps, etc. Sorry, no returns or international shipping. If you have any questions about the listing, please feel free to ask. The guitar will be shipped 3 days (max) after payment. Good luck and thank you for bidding!", "ItemID": "223209646060", "EndTime": "2018-11-05T23:18:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T23:18:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jay-Turser-JT-200-Pro-Electric-Guitar-/223209646060", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Amherst, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232096460608080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/ve0AAOSwI~Vb15Kh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/f7IAAOSwEX5b15Ke/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/~oEAAOSwm-Fb15Ka/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/AQwAAOSwgYdb15Kk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/DrQAAOSw~LBb15Km/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/YBIAAOSw9z1b15Kq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/MfEAAOSwNpRb15Kt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/jeoAAOSwBfhb15Kx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/-DIAAOSw3S5b15K1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "01002", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hergiswi", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 73, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 203.73, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 203.73, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 262}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jay Turser JT-200 Pro Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jay Turser"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JT-200 Pro"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 292, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 206.23, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar is fully functional; hardware has some wear, there are a couple of minor scratches and it definitely needs new strings, but there is nothing inhibiting it from being played", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
