{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Les Paul Semi-Hollow Body Electric Guitar w/HSC in Fire Red. Condition is Used but in excellent condition. This is a great playing Les Paul guitar in a rare Semi-Hollow body style. The craftsmanship is flawless IMO. I really don't play it much because I'm a Strat guy so it has been hanging in my basement for the past 6-8 months. I did have it setup when I purchased it but would suggest getting it set up again. It has a few dead spots in the neck because of not playing it, but a set up with a neck adjustment should do the trick. It sounds like a true Les Paul and please don't ask for pictures of the headstock. if you're considering this guitar you kind of know why.I will include a nice HSC. I really hate to see it go , it's for sure a keeper. It's a great collector and player guitar. I will include the guitar strap a $29.99 value and the strap locks a $19.99 value free with the \"Buy it Now\" price only", "ItemID": "113599198010", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T19:46:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T17:24:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Les-Paul-Semi-Hollow-Body-Electric-Guitar-w-HSC-Fire-Red-burst-Price-lowered-/113599198010", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Sewell, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135991980108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x8wAAOSwFSNcTJTl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nK0AAOSwA3xcTJT4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zw8AAOSw8U9cTJUH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mpcAAOSwJ3RcTJUW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K9MAAOSw2zRcTJUl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xEgAAOSw6CNcTJUu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xioAAOSw4sNcTJU5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MHoAAOSw~8JcTJVE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08080", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "seafoodman.856", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 718, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 71}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Les Paul Semi-Hollow Body Electric Guitar w/HSC in Fire Red burst-Price lowered!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 762, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
