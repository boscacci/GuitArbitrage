{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "USA Auction Only! *I will consider any realistic offer but am not interested in any trades. The made in Japan ESP Eclipses are VERY hard to find with a real Floyd Rose and I have this one priced to sell as is. These guitars are well over 2k new IF you can find them. How CRAZY is that? You can get this one which is in great condition for less than half that price. At this time there isn't another one of these on eBay. Don't miss out! This is a very good condition made in Japan 2012 ESP Eclipse in gloss ebony with Floyd Rose tremolo and OHSC. If you're looking at this then you know how good and sought after these earlier Eclipses are. This one has active EMG 81/60 pickups. This guitar has had a recent set up, plays effortlessly, needs nothing and is ready to rock! Please review all the photos as they are a part of the description and show the guitars condition and what's included. Overall this guitar is very clean with just light marks and swirls in the clear coat on the front and some buckle marks on the back and backplates. This one being glossy black is pretty hard to get shots without glare but there's no dings, dents. The jumbo frets are in great shape with very minimal wear if any. The case is in great shape with a few scuffs but no functional issues. Condition is very subjective but I describe everything as best I can and I do have a 100% positive seller rating. If you have any questions please ask. *I'm willing to negotiate a little on the price. But, if you make an offer, please be realistic. Low ball offers will be auto declined.*Shipping indicated is for the lower 48 States only. Alaska and Hawaii will be higher.Please check my other auctions for more guitar and bass gear!", "ItemID": "223399468926", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T16:11:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T02:36:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-2012-Eclipse-MIJ-Standard-Series-Guitar-Floyd-Rose-EMG-81-60-Pickups-Case-EX-/223399468926", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Jacksonville, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233994689268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0NlgxNjAw/z/uWcAAOSwQKdcahjG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1OVgxNjAw/z/B9wAAOSwyABcahjP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-QYAAOSwslJcahjI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwOVgxNjAw/z/QIUAAOSwdyVcahjL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1NFgxNjAw/z/bj0AAOSw9C5cahjN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIyWDE2MDA=/z/N18AAOSwRKtcahjQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzgxWDE2MDA=/z/vJsAAOSwNIpcahjY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4MFgxNjAw/z/B-YAAOSwXL1cahjU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/ihEAAOSww35cahjW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjUyWDE2MDA=/z/mlAAAOSwLqRcahjZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "32226", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "poprocks2004", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4934, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1169.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1169.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 610}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP 2012 Eclipse MIJ Standard Series Guitar Floyd Rose EMG 81/60 Pickups Case EX", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Eclipse"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}]}, "HitCount": 47, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "very good condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
