An ideal instrument for dazzling high-speed playing, the San Dimas Style 1 HH FR M boasts scorching sound, stunning style and grininducing playing feel and performance. Its body is crafted from ash and is coupled with a bolt-on two-piece maple neck with a pair of graphite reinforcement rods to resist bending and warping under environmental stresses. The speed neck profile is designed for lightning fast playing and completely unhindered position shifts while the comfortably rolled fingerboard edges provide the broken-in feel of an instrument with plenty of playing miles on it, and plenty more to go. This axe also features a maple fingerboard with 22 jumbo frets and black dot inlays, as well as a heel-mounted spoke wheel for quick and convenient truss rod adjustments. High-output Seymour Duncan JB and Seymour Duncan '59 humbucking pickups are directly mounted to the body, cranking out high octane rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll tone with plenty of sweet overtones. The volume control conceals a push/pull coil split to have even more tonal variations on tap while the No-Load tone control operates like a standard tone control from positions one through nine, removing itself from the circuit at position ten for transparent sound, letting the full natural voice of the guitar shine through. Dive to rumbling depths or add a well-placed rising harmonic without sacrificing your tuning with the Floyd Rose 1000 series double-locking recessed tremolo bridge system. Designed with style in mind, the San Dimas Style 1 HH FR M is brand new finishes &mdash; Satin Black (gold hardware).
