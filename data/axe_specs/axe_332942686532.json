{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Player Telecaster Left-Handed Electric Guitar - Black SKU#1016890 SKU: 1016890 Item Condition E+ Excellent Plus - May have slight wear, but only visible under close up inspection. Item Description Bold, innovative and rugged, the Player Telecaster LH is pure Fender, through and through. The feel, the style and, most importantly, the sound-they're all there, waiting for you to make them whisper or wail for your music. Versatile enough to handle almost anything you can create and durable enough to survive any gig, this workhorse is a trusty sidekick for your musical vision. Respecting our heritage while maintaining our innovative spirit, the pair of Player Series single-coil Telecaster pickups are crisp and articulate-it's authentic Fender tone with a modern edge. The \"Modern C\"-shaped maple neck's comfortable contours and smooth finish are ideal for almost any playing style. By adding a 22nd medium jumbo fret to the contemporary 9.5\"-radius fingerboard we've made it easier to express yourself musically. To enhance the traditional twang and bite of a Telecaster, we added bent-steel saddles to the string-through-body bridge for precise intonation and to help your sound cut through the mix, sustaining until the sun burns out. Other features include master volume and tone controls, a 3-way pickup switch with barrel tip, 3-ply pickguard, synthetic bone nut, dual-wing string tree, sealed tuning machines and four-bolt \"F\"-stamped neck plate that marks this instrument as the real deal-as Fender as it gets. When you need a guitar that will take anything you can throw at it, stand up, dust itself off and ask for more, reach for the Player Telecaster LH.
