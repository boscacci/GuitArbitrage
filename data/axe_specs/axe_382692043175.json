{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Happy Holidays Everyone! Looking for that special present for that Special Someone? Well, you may have just found it! This mid- 2000's Epiphone Les Paul Traditional PRO is just gorgeous! And in IMMACULATE shape! Not one scratch! I purchased this to complete a recording project and it has sat in it's Brand New case in my smoke-free studio closet. Unplayed after I finished that recording. I've been playing acoustically for years and have no need for an electric guitar for live playing. But I've always wanted to own a Les Paul Goldtop since I was a teenager. I had the opportunity to purchase a '56 Goldtop back then but my parents nixed the deal as too expensive (at the time a whopping $400. Worth about $10,000 today! Good finiancial advise, Pop!). So like some long lost, unattained treasure the image of one remained in my mind. Haunting me. When the opportnity arose, I bought one for myself to add to my guitar and basses. I've owned many, many guitars and basses over the years but strangley this was my 1st Les Paul. I will be sad to see her go. . . I accept PayPal and will Ship FREE to the Lower 48 States. International Shipping will be the actual Shipping costs to your location. I'll also consider serious Offers. Thank You for your consideration and again, have a Wonderful Holidays!", "ItemID": "382692043175", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T21:39:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T18:27:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Traditional-PRO-Goldtop-Brand-New-Hard-Shell-Case-/382692043175", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Goleta, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3826920431758080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3fkAAOSwPuRcIRkA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/lhUAAOSwzDFcIRlS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/WWcAAOSwP8dcIRja/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/c0wAAOSwfsdcIRjn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/kNgAAOSwEKxcIRjA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/TWoAAOSwn01cIRjP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/GT4AAOSwMg5cIRjV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/dzIAAOSwUWtcIRjg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kZEAAOSwI9FcIRjs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ii4AAOSwQqNcIRjy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CX4AAOSw8OFcIRj3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kRYAAOSwEKxcIRj8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "93117", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bigk94u", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 445, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 144}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "Asia"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul Traditional PRO Goldtop - Brand New Hard Shell Case!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany Body Mahogany Neck"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Traditional PRO"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Goldtop"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Grover Tuners"]}]}, "HitCount": 223, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "IMMACULATE!
