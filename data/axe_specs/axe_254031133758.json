{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a Fender Tele Joe Strummer Art Series Guitar with G&G Fender Hard case. The finish is coming off places on this guitar. See the arrow in the picture. FENDER TELE JOE STRUMMER THE CLASH Rockin The Casbah ART SERIES GUITARFrom Fender\u00ae's Artist Series, this Telecaster features an alder body with a maple \"C\" shape neck, rosewood fingerboard and 2 vintage style single-coil Tele\u00ae pickups with alnico magnets. Designed in cooperation with the Strummer estate, the Joe Strummer electric guitar has a highly distressed \"road-worn\" treatment that duplicates the original's worn-to-the-wood layers of gray auto primer and flat black spray paint. It also features a \"Revolution Rock\" engraved neckplate and a limited edition art customization kit that includes Strummer-inspired stencils, stickers and graphics by designer Shepard Fairey. Strummer was, of course, the Clash's articulate and fiery co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and lead singer; he later founded, recorded and toured with the Mescaleros. All his life, he vigorously championed individuality, self-expression and change--tenets often reflected in the constantly altered look of his favorite instrument--his Telecaster (currently on display in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland), an otherwise standard '60s-era model with all the original parts and specifications. When Strummer bought it in 1975 for \u00e9120, the guitar had a Three-color Sunburst finish. He was having none of that, of course, but his improvised DIY gray and black \"finishes\" deteriorated quickly, giving the Telecaster its distinctive look. Like Strummer's music, the battered electric guitar changed constantly--plastered as it was with stencils, stickers and new paint jobs through the many stages of Strummer's life and career.
