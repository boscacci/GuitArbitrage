{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "First of all let me say that the pictures don\u2019t begin to do this guitar justice. I spent more money than I\u2019ll ever admit to in order to get this amazing instrument to where it is today. I specially ordered Diamarzio Illuminators with gold poles to match the amazing metallic gold flake paint, clear coated with beautiful automotive poly. Check out the pictures to see for yourself, this beauty is sick! The neck is is amazing shape and the inlays look great and they\u2019re truly one of a kind and done professionally with extreme care and it shows. An inlay of King Tut is on the 1st fret and an Egyptian winged disc on the 12th fret. Additionally, I had two Dimarzio illuminator humbucker pickups installed to this beauty of a guitar with a Super Distortion in the middle. For those who aren\u2019t familiar with these amazingly solid pickups, the illuminatiors are John Petrucci\u2019s signature set and the name is also a perfect fit for the theme. The middle pickup is also a humbucker- Not a single coil and it sounds very full and punchy. I also added brand new Gotoh tuners a pickguard and matching gold knobs as well. The neck is straight and the frets are good; this guitar plays like a dream just how it looks. Originally I took a Prestige neck and had an inlay upgrade that literally nobody has ever had before. I had Pharaoh King Tut inlayed on the first fret, hence the name of the guitar being Pharaoh. I had gold,blue, and silver pyramid inlays and the \u201cwinged disc\u201d on the 12th fret. The reason for the name Pharaoh is this guitar is to represent the Egyptian Pharaohs, with no detail overlooked. Obviously I will be including a hard shell Ibanez flight case along with professional packing service and full insurance.
