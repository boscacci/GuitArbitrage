{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Listed is an Ibanez PGM Mikro guitar in white with painted on F-holes. I've modified this little guitar quite heavily as a project, and I was pleasantly surprised with how good it plays and sounds. Here is the list of upgrades: - Seymour Duncan Pearly Gates pickup in the neck position.- Seymour Duncan JB Trembucker (With Alnico II magnet installed) in the bridge position.- Rewired featuring a push-pull knob which will split both pickups.- 3-way switch- Gotoh hardtail bridge.- Kluson Deluxe tuners- Electrosocket jack The guitar really does have an excellent rock sound with the full size humbuckers, and you can split the pickups for single coil sounds as well. I've recorded with this guitar and it sounds great. It plays fairly well, and because it's a 3/4 size guitar, you can get some huge bends from it. Please contact me with any additional questions.", "ItemID": "163355299067", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T23:14:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T23:14:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-PGM-Mikro-Guitar-Upgraded-Hardware-and-Electronics-/163355299067", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nashville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633552990678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/C50AAOSwKQFb33qF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mvQAAOSwl5Jb33qN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8I4AAOSws99b33qT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ibEAAOSw2-pb33qa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/05sAAOSwD~Fb33qu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qXAAAOSwg8xb33q2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OKsAAOSwWW5b33q9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6EMAAOSwDX5b33rF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37201", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mattheoconno_2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 43, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 18, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 153.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 153.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez PGM Mikro Guitar - Upgraded Hardware and Electronics", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["PGM Mikro"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["3/4"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}]}, "HitCount": 116, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 155.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar is in 100% working order.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
