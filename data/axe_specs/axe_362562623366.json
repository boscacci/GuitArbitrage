{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Real Budweiser Aria electric guitar surrounded by red neon with the Budweiser cursive logo on the bottom in red underlined in blue neon. This sign is an incredible display piece and is in perfect condition. These cannot be purchased in stores and are very hard to come by. This sign is an original brewery neon and not a knockoff reproduction like many others out there. Genuine Anheuser- Busch label on the back of the sign is proof of authenticity.Has extra long cord. The sign measures APPROX. 36\" wide X 52\" length in excellent working condition and is ready to display. The enclosed Strat style Aria guitar is a working instrument. This is a limited edition collectible and has little if any noticeable signs of wear. The buyer is responsible for all applicable taxes, shipping, and handling, (shipping insurance is highly recommended) **The history of my personal research and information personally gathered of these limited quantity collections were originally produced by Anheuser-Busch and presented to their high volume distributors / retailers through out the United States in the 80's era. Obviously one of if not the most sought after signage produced in the history of neon memorabilia. Hash Tag # The King Of Beers # The King Of Neon Signs # (with a touch of vintage electric guitar to boot). This listing up for bid was acquired by me from a township in the northern states that was originally a donation soon after it was produced but never made it to the auction. Was placed in storage until last year when the item was placed up for bid through a government auction surplus. Unknowing of the details or history of the sign/instrument and with nothing more than a interest in Vintage Guitars, i was amazed of the qality and condition not to mention a curiosity that the individual that originally thought of the idea had any idea of the popularity and rarity this piece would eventually become. As neon signs became more popular and still are as of today i can say of all that i know of in existence and have personally seen, Anheuser-Busch did in fact create the King Of Neon Signs. Many of these original signs of the quantity of the actual Limited Edition of this sign reach well over $1,000 to $1,500 with no certainty of wear or condition as to the fact many of the originals made their way into establishments with heavy use, and understandably so, because of their brilliant projection of lighting and masterful craftsmanship this one sets the tone for any occasion. Perfect actually! THANK YOU FOR VIEWING THIS ITEM!!
