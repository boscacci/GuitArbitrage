{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Rickenbacker 360 Electric Guitar, Black color. 2016 by the serial number, still has the USA sticker on pickguard. Excellent used condition, there are some very small nicks/dings in the front and back near the input jack, but you have to look very closely, I can't even get them to show in photos. Plays and sounds amazing, but I need to pare down my collection and honestly I don't know too much about Rickenbackers so please ask any questions before buying, thanks! I don't have an original case for it so it will be shipped in a replacement gig bag for protection, packed very well in a guitar shipping box. Shipment will also be insured. The Rickenbacker 360 broke all the rules of traditional styling when it hit in the 60s. Its special contour around the body perimeter is one of the most comfortable guitars of all time. Its body is carved from one piece of maple with a precisely fitted piece of maple for the back. The slim neck is made of maple with a rosewood fingerboard and dual truss rod. Two updated Hi-Gain pickups are their own high output pickups designed to be able to go from a clear clean to a biting overdrive. The bound body and Rosewood fingerboard, inlayed with triangular pearloid markers, provide an exceptionally attractive appearance. Stereo output is standard.
