{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your bidding pleasure is a Vintage (Trevor Wilkinson) brand VSA500SB ES335 style guitar. I received this in trade for some HVAC work a few months back. I don\u2019t know a lot about these, but they get fantastic reviews. I had intended to get electronics and tuners and use it, but I have a tendency to collect projects...and I have far too many on my plate at the moment. This guitar is beautiful, and it\u2019s in good condition. As you can see in the photos there are some light scratches from use, but nothing that couldn\u2019t be buffed out. There are areas of chipped finish around the tuner holes (on the back side) and controls holes, but I have put tuners (vintage two hole Grover type) and pots (US spec) in it and they do cover the imperfections. This guitar will need electronics, a nut, tuners, strap buttons, and a pickguard. The bridge and stop tail are Wilkinson, (they are included) which I believe are original, and there is a ground wire to the bridge. The control holes look to have been drilled to fit US spec control pots, and the pot I tested it with was from a US Made Fender and it fit perfectly. The neck and frets look/feel good. I\u2019m no guitar tech, but I\u2019ve been playing long enough to know a decent fret job when I see it. Having said that, I\u2019ve never had it strung up, so it may need a setup or some light fret work, etc. I\u2019ve tried to get pics of all the details, good and bad, but if you\u2019d like more details or more pics please let me know. I\u2019m not a business, I\u2019m just a guy selling stuff he no longer needs, so I don\u2019t accept returns. I always try to make my auctions as accurate as possible, but please pay attention to the photos and ask any questions you may have. Thanks and good luck!", "ItemID": "233143155062", "EndTime": "2019-03-02T03:05:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-23T03:05:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Brand-VSA500SB-ES335-style-semi-hollow-electric-guitar-sunburst-/233143155062", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Dayton, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331431550628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PTkAAOSwZcZccLaW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XzwAAOSwu2tccLZq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OV0AAOSw3qVccLaI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZP0AAOSwxS9ccLaO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xd0AAOSwaAtccLaT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/17oAAOSwaRRccLaR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D7cAAOSwaCVccLaU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yW0AAOSwpvRccLaM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yZ0AAOSwC4lccLaL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LKwAAOSwRaFccLaP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ULMAAOSwZntccLZp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ujgAAOSwdX5ccLaJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "45432", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "01rtstratus", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 296, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.3}, "BidCount": 33, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 203.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 203.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***f", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 37}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Brand VSA500SB ES335 style semi hollow electric guitar in sunburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["VSA500SB"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Type", "Value": ["Electric Guitar"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 627, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 206.01, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
