{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "( RARE ORIGINAL, PRE CBS STRATOCASTER ) Here is a Vintage and Very very original 1959 Fender Stratocaster early 8 hole pickguarded body, That weighs 4lbs 2.7oz (Very Light) with an original body date of 4/59. This was just a few months before Fender went to the 11 hole Mint pickguards. The body is in excellent shape with small minor Subtle dings here and there, and has the correct 1959 identifying markings of a pre cbs Fender. I purchased this from a guitar dealer in NYC a few months back. The facts from him were \u201c the owner stripped it down in the mid 60s to remove the finish without removing any additional wood or deforming or altering Original Body Contours \u201d and just never put it back together again. ( No Additional Routes, Cuts, Holes or Plugs done to this Body At All ) The dealer sold the matching neck and electronics before I could purchase them. The routes of the body have never been altered or stripped, showing original body date 4/59 and finish. This is ( a rarity ) since at the very least the body date is almost always stripped, or painted over or removed, loosing this crucial piece of Factory identification. This was a sunburst guitar originally, from seeing what\u2019s left in the routes. As you can see from the pictures, the nail marks and pin router marks (from the Fender Factory remain and are still visible) that were factory filled, and which are some identifying features of vintage Fender from this era. One pickguard screw hole has a small piece of wood that has been chipped out ( and under the Guard, an easy fix) though the chip looks to be many many years old. The whole body was shot in a clear sealer for preservation purposes. Over all, this is a super nice ( Excellent ) and Genuinely authentic Original 1959 Stratocaster guitar body. This was a personal side project, when the body is professionally refinished in its original nitrocellulose 3tsb sunburst, it will be a gorgeous unmolested example of a early 1959 Stratocaster when it\u2019s complete. Product guaranteed to be in Described condition, Price Listed is more then Fair, for a Original 1959 Stratocaster body this clean and weight of 4lbs 2.7ozs ALL SALES ARE FINAL.
