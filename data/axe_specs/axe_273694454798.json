{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello, everyone! For your consideration today I am offering my very sought after, very beautiful and chambered, 60\u2019s slim taper neck 2008 Gibson Les Paul Classic in the classic Ebony. It is 100% all original down to the \u201c1960\u201d engraved pickguard. Even though it is supposed to be non chambered, it still weighs a healthy 8.2/8.5lbs. It is an 11-year-old guitar, but it looks good and sounds incredible! It was used as a \u201cRhythm\u201d guitar and was not soloed on much, or abused at all; on the contrary. The frets are original and have all the life left. Other than some buckle rash on the back in the lacquer finish, there aren\u2019t really any dings, chips, paint missing etc at all, but I\u2019ll let the pictures do the talking. It is an 11-year-old guitar, and there may be an imperfection here and there, but it does not affect playability whatsoever. It is a really nice example of an \u201colder\u201d Gibson Les Paul that not only looks nice, but sounds amazingly too and they honestly don\u2019t make them like this any more, especially the classics. As nice as the guitar looks, it\u2019s the tone, sustain and playability where it truly shines. It also comes with the OHSC that is very clean. I am reluctantly selling my guitar for $1690 and the flat rate shipping is $85 anywhere in the CONUS. I will not get too much in to specs like other people as you probably already know this guitar, and know what you are looking for, but I will let the pictures do the talking like I said. This was a hand selected model with a beautiful ebony top, so, you do not have to be worried about the appearance and I can assure you that based on playability alone, it is very hard for me letting this guitar go. If you are in the market for this guitar, and I know many people are, why spend so much elsewhere, when you can purchase it from me for so much less? I own/collect many high end Gibson Les Pauls, and this one is up there with all of them with the amazing sustain, great tone and playability. I know I will get contacted a lot as this is a great deal and a steal compared to what these go for normally, and with that said, I will not be able to hold the guitar. It is first come first serve. Anyway, please contact me with any questions and I will be more than happy to answer. Good luck and thank you for looking. I described the guitar to the best of my ability and reserve the right to end this sale at any time should my guitar sell locally or on other websites listed. Flat rate shipping of $85 anywhere in the CONUS.", "ItemID": "273694454798", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T21:50:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-09T18:36:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2008-Gibson-Les-Paul-Classic-Ebony-All-Original-OHSC-And-Papers-60-s-Neck-/273694454798", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "San Diego, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736944547988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O4kAAOSwEbxcXxzI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZZkAAOSwJoxcXxzi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y2YAAOSwCR9cXxzL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~HoAAOSwFeNcXxzK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iEoAAOSwdwlcXxzO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o5cAAOSw02FcXxzN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/W1AAAOSw~9JcXxzT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1F0AAOSwfVFcXxz6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t-IAAOSwBz1cXxza/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o3wAAOSwqpFcXxz4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MEgAAOSwHQdcXxzz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FbIAAOSwo8NcXxze/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92122", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "us.vejzo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1690.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1690.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 91}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2008 Gibson Les Paul Classic Ebony All Original With OHSC And Papers 60\u2019s Neck", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ebony"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2008"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 195, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
