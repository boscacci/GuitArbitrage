{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a very nice S7G 8 string Cobra. I got this at auction here locally earlier this year. It is in excellent condition. There are some slight scratches on the back of the lower horn and pick scratches on the front. 30.2\" scale length, 27 stainless frets, one piece flame maple neck finished in what appears to be Truoil, Macassar ebony fretboard, Sperzel tuners, poplar body finished in a satin black, recessed Dunlop strap knobs, Dimarzio Ionizer pickups, Hipshot bridge and 5-way blade switch with single volume and tone. At 8 pounds 7 ounces it is slightly neck heavy when playing with a strap. The neck has a flat \"u\" profile which I like. Strung with Daddario 9-42 55 65 strings. Comes with original hard case in nice, solid condition with some cosmetic outer wear.This is an older model, without a serial number. I emailed Jim Lewis at S7G about this. He gave me the specs on it, and although he doesn't remember this guitar specifically, suspects it was pieced together with spare parts for an employees personal use. No clue how it made it from Ohio to me in Phoenix. And as much as I like it, I don't have the chops to play it and I bought it with the intention of selling it. *NOTE* My price drop to $450+shipping is my lowest.
