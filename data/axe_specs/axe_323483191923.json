{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 1996 FENDER STRAT PLUS in excellent condition, with an Inca Silver finish and original case. Great looks, tone and playability. The Strat Plus was the basis for Jeff Beck\u2019s signature Fender guitar. This guitar is in super clean condition, with the only complaints being a tiny ding on the back of the headstock; and a finish scratch on the back of the high E tuner. These are pictured. When I bought the guitar, the G string tuner was stripped so I replaced it with the correct Fender Schaller part. It has been meticulously intonated and set up with new Ernie Ball Regular Slinky strings (10), a low action and floating tremolo. It plays wonderfully, the neck is super smooth, and the fretboard and frets are in near mint condition. The Fender Gold Lace Sensor pickups deliver classic Fender tone with a very articulate tonal range, and are balanced at all volumes with no hum and lots of sustain. These pickups have been used by some of the world\u2019s best guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Pete Townsend, and Buddy Guy. The guitar comes with the original Fender hardshell case with a key, which is lightweight but very strong. The exterior is in fair condition, but it closes and latches just fine. The interior is in great shape. Please ask any questions before bidding. Everything works fine on the guitar including the truss rod. Once I set this up I've never had to adjust the guitar... it's very stable.

Flat shipping of $80 to the lower 48 US states only.
