{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "JACKSON DINKY DK2S WITH SUSTAINIAC PICKUP- ORIGINAL HARDSHELL CASE- NO RESERVE! Here is a used but clean Jackson DK2S Dinky. This model features a factory Sustainiac system whirh allows for near infinite sustain options. I believe this one was made in Japan, though it isn't marked anywhere, and I don't think Jackson offers it anymore. It's in excellent cosmetic shape and it comes with the original molded plastic Jackson case and the tremelo arm. The finish shows one BB size (or smaller) impression and some very light pick marks in the clear coat (no missing paint). The hardware is clean, the neck is straight with low, easy playing action and excellent frets. I did notice that the volume control is a little scratchy sounding and there is one spot when you turn it that the signal cuts out. I cleaned it with some electronic cleaner and it got a little better but it still has that dead spot so you may need to install a new volume pot. The Sustainiac system is a lot of fun. It has an on/off switch so you can play the guitar normally or activate the string driver for sustain effects. It has three modes (I think Harmonic, Fundamental and Mix). The drive seems slightly weaker in Harmonic mode than the other two modes but that may be normal (this is the only Sustainiac equipped guitar I've played). All in all this is just a great playing guitar and the sustain possibilities add so much to your playing and sound. Remember, the volume pot has an issue, though the guitar is ready to play as is, there just a dead spot in the sweep of the volume knob. Good luck! U.S. shipping will be $35 (more to Alaska and Hawaii).
