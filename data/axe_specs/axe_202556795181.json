{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is mid 80's Carvin DC150 electric guitar. Black finish with ebony fretboard. Outstanding build quality. It's in great structural shape with some minor cosmetic wear light light scuffs, scratches, etc. The neck/body joint has the typical finish line. It's purely cosmetic, not structural or has any movement. I've owned several of these over the years and they nearly all have this line. The guitar appears to be original. I know these came with Schaller 455 bridges standard but this one has a German Leo Quan Badass which was a factory option. It plays extremely well. The action is pretty low. The neck is straight and truss rod functions as it should. The frets are in great shape showing only minor wear. All electronics are checked and sound great. Carvin logo gig bag included. I will ship well packaged in a proper box. Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "202556795181", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T01:23:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T15:30:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Mid-80s-Carvin-DC150-Stereo-Electric-Guitar-Black-Ebony-w-Gig-Bag-/202556795181", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025567951818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EX4AAOSwt~1cLs-r/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NuUAAOSw851cLs-x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zRsAAOSwXIdcLs-q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6kgAAOSwhfRcLs-o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hYUAAOSwAThcLs-0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WOwAAOSw5tNcLs-t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wrkAAOSwLNxcLs-u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-tEAAOSwxtVcLs-4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UnUAAOSwWk5cLs-2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jmoAAOSw3T5cLs-y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nT8AAOSw-rxcLs-1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vCgAAOSwlThcLs-v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6611, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 797}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Mid 80's Carvin DC150 Stereo Electric Guitar Black Ebony w/ Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Carvin"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["DC150"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 124, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Central America and Caribbean", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
