{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am the original owner. This is a Peavey Raptor Plus Custom guitar with a maple neck in excellent condition with some added features. Included with this guitar are removable Daprofe Blues Guitar fret board stickers. If you want to learn to play blues or rock, these stickers enable you to learn major and minor blues and pentatonic scales quickly. These stickers can be easily removed and do not harm the neck of the guitar. There are YouTube videos that show how they work. Also included with this guitar are custom stainless steel volume and tone knobs. A new Cyclone padded gig bag is included as well. I have owned several of these Raptor Custom guitars. They have great necks, are easy to play and have great tone with lots of sustain. NOTE: Tremolo bar not included. From the manufacturer: Exclusive PowerPlateTM increases sustain: The Patent Pending PowerPlate\u2122is a new innovation from Peavey that increases sustain while virtually eliminating dead spots on the fretboard. The wider pole pieces on the pickups produce a more focused guitar tone while the vintage style steel bridge increases the amount of string energy transmitted into the body. The patent pending Peavey Powerplate is a new innovation for stringed instruments. The Powerplate is a metal plate that is embedded into the back of the headstock which increases sustain and volume. The Powerplate is mounted using the machine heads and increases the amount of string vibration energy that is projected by the instrument.
