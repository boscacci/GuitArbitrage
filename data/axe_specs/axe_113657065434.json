Black finish w/3ply black pickguard. MADE IN JAPAN. 2000 Fujigen manufacture. Mahogany body w/maple top, mahogany neck, long neck tenon, and Gibson type open book headstock! Serial number on the headstock back. It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few small marks and scratches on it here and there nothing that I found that I would call significantly major and overall I'd say that it's in fine shape! Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the neck, body, and headstock are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Front and rear plastic pickup rings have thin cracks which I did not find to affect play or stability of either pickups in any way as is. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic! Big beefy tone and plenty of power! I found this one to be a great player! If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Comes w/Gibson USA hardcase in fine functional condition.
