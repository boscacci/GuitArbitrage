{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I would have liked to have had one of the ESP Explorers from the late '80's and early '90's when you could have had them with the rosewood fingerboards since I already have the ebony ones....so I made one! I had it painted Olympic White from the late\u00a0Bill Eacobacci who used to do some really bang up work on painting Explorers and doing the Kirk Hammett Mummy guitars and such. He did a perfect job. Otherwise this is outfitted exactly as any of the ESP Explorers have been done over the years. That silver sticker back by the tailpiece is just one of those decals to be peeled off easily. It's really light and resonant and is really great to play. There are some bumps and dings on the guitar but nothing serious and now you don't have to worry about it.\u00a0 Gotoh TunersMX250 Style Truss Rod CoverBlack Tusq NutFrets polished and leveledEMG 81/60 comboTwo Volume no tone like Hetfield.Schaller strap buttonsTonepros locking bridgeTonepros locking tailpiece studsMetal pickup rings and output jack cover Comes with a perfect fitting Gibson case seen in the pics.", "ItemID": "382686932898", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T06:53:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T22:32:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-Edwards-ESP-Explorer-Guitar-/382686932898", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Omaha, Nebraska", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3826869328988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ne0AAOSw2hxcHWYJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bXIAAOSwBkBcHWXt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8AsAAOSwQ5pcHWXw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UtkAAOSwb8BcHWX0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zkQAAOSwdwVcHWX2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/W50AAOSwjthcHWX4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8lsAAOSwxDJcHWX6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "68118", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bsmith483", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 467, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 999.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 999.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 263}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Used!
