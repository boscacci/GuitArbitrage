{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 2012 Peavey Session guitar that sold new for $500. This has brand new Elexir strings and just had the gutiar professionally setup and intonation adjusted. This plays and sounds great and plays similar to a Paul Reed Smith guitar in the sense that it nearly plays itself. Strings are every to bend due to the arched neck. This has scratches and dings as seen, including two scratches on the back that has touch up paint on. No cracked or broken parts. FEATURES: Crafted with a chambered basswood body, bolt-on hard rock Canadian Maple neck and a genuine rosewood fretboard, the Peavey Session\u2122 guitar combines traditional style with modern design perfection. Two premium Peavey USA design humbucking pickups give the Session its signature tones. Die cast nickel plated string-through-the-body bridge with stainless steel saddles for bite and sustain. The silky satin neck finish allows for that \"broken in\" feel. The ergonomic elliptical neck profile is comfortable and fits the hand like a glove. Peavey's special compound radius fretboard allows deep bending in upper register yet has the \"vintage\" feel in the lower register. The Session features a 15 degree tilted headstock with straight string pull. 25.5\" scale with 22 nickel silver frets Bolt-on Canadian rock maple neck with comfortable sculpted five bolt attachment Dual carbon fiber neck inserts for added reinforcement Genuine Rosewood fingerboard with special compound radius Graphite composite topnut for clarity and sustain Tone chambered, resonant basswood body with integral center section Nickel Plated Die cast string-through-body bridge with stainless steel saddles Recessed volume & tone controls with push/pull coil tap function Recessed high quality 3 way pickup selector switchDual action torsion rod Two premium Peavey USA design Alnico pickups, coil tapped Dual carbon fiber neck inserts for added reinforcement 15:1 stable post designed die cast machine heads", "ItemID": "202543054780", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T13:20:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-20T04:16:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PEAVEY-SESSION-STRAT-STYLE-HH-BASSWOOD-SUNBURST-CHAMBERED-BODY-GUITAR-/202543054780", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "North Salt Lake, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025430547808080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODA=/z/vREAAOSw76lcGxTX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OFg2NDA=/z/vRoAAOSw76lcGxTd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg2MTQ=/z/XTEAAOSwi3xcGxUS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzI3WDE2MDA=/z/jI4AAOSwgb1cGxTY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMzUy/z/MqEAAOSwu4dcGxTa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zkIAAOSwG25cGxUA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQ2WDE2MDA=/z/Ec8AAOSwXItcGxTc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEzWDE2MDA=/z/ZLIAAOSwip5cGxTe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg2WDE2MDA=/z/9NcAAOSwzDFcGxTg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg2WDE2MDA=/z/iWcAAOSwAEFcGxTi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OFg3NTI=/z/W0QAAOSwWIJcGxTj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/E3cAAOSw87JcGxTk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84054", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "helens-cove", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 146, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 195.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 195.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2106}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PEAVEY SESSION STRAT STYLE HH BASSWOOD SUNBURST CHAMBERED BODY GUITAR\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 25, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Seller"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
