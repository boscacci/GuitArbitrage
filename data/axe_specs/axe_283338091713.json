{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "No reserve auction for a beautiful like new Tele tone monster ash loaded body in white and vintage mint green pickup cover. Pickups are Fender Custom Shop Texas Special three wire neck and a John Benson Custom bridge pickup. These are connected to a Fender 4 way switch that gives four great tones; bridge, bridge and neck, bridge and neck in series and neck. Tones are absolutely great and the Benson bridge is a great match with the Fender Custom Shop neck. Pots are Bourns 250k and switch is the Oak Grigsby style from Fender. Over $150 invested in pickups and switching. All cavities are shielded for low noise. Bridge plate is a Fender pat. pend. with brass saddles. This setup is well balanced offering great vintage tone and the added ability to push an amp when needed. The body is from Asia and has been routed for a Nashville 3 pickup setup if you ever wanted to add a middle pickup. Body weighs 6.4 lbs loaded. It does have a few minor blemishes. On the back String ferrules aren\u2019t quite lined and there is some small paint chips around the ferrules. Overall paint is very good. Neck pocket is great. I fitted a Warmoth Tele neck and the neck pocket sizing is perfect. Just snug but not so tight as to cause any cracks. Control panel on the front fits up right to the edge of the control cavity. This allows a small amount of the control cavity shielding to show. It is barely noticeable and may be possible to fix by shifting control plate or going with oversized plate. Overall great guitar with some awesome tone! Happy bidding!On Jan-13-19 at 17:28:19 PST, seller added the following information: Capacitor is a vintage Russian PIO 033uf.
