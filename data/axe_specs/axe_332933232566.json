{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "In an effort to \"thin the herd\", up for auction is my 2001 Sunburst Fender Cyclone. This is a \"players guitar\" meaning it has the natural wear of an instrument that has been played. There are minor dings and scratches of which I have tried to capture in the photographs. There is also \"picking haze\" the fine scratches above the neck pickup on the body. They show up very faintly in the photographs. The frets have good life left and the guitar works as it should both mechanically and electronically. Included in the auction/ sale is a Musicians Gear hardcase. (see photos).
