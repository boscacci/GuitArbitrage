(Classified as Excellent condition when purchased used online.)This model is now out of production.Purchased used in excellent condition from a nationally franchised instrument store.Everything is fully functional. Just some light scratches on the front and a few on the back. One little nick on the top shoulder of the body is photographed. Light weight, balanced and easy to play. Upper frets (past the 12th)are a bit too \"tight\" from my fingers. Perfect guitar for a younger or smaller person. Fast, easy to play neck.
