Included with the guitar is a black leather strap, a cord, and the case. From Epiphone:The \u201cTuxedo\u201d Les PaulThe Les Paul Custom was first introduced in 1954 at the suggestion of Mr. Les Paul himself who wanted to prove to audiences that his solid body electric guitar was not a fad but a superb and challenging instrument. So, Les requested a Les Paul with a custom color finish in solid Ebony with gold hardware that would blend well with a tuxedo and really set-off a player on stage with style.The Les Paul Custom--or the \u201ctuxedo\u201d Les Paul, as it became known among fans--quickly became one of the most recognized guitars in the world. Les himself used his Les Paul Custom in concert for decades, on his weekly television show with wife Mary Ford, and on countless album covers, including Chester and Lester, his famous guitar duel with pal Chet Atkins.", "ItemID": "233012667224", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T22:17:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T22:17:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Classic-Solid-Body-Electric-Guitar-Black-Case-/233012667224", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Waleska, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330126672248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wiIAAOSwG8lb8zMM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oZQAAOSwPeVb8zMD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kiwAAOSwwqVb8zL3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XvMAAOSwU1Nb8zMK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VvEAAOSw8Mxb8zMN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ix8AAOSwzThb8zL2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WakAAOSwEJ1b8zL9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5PoAAOSw5qdb8zMN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hBkAAOSwC45b8zMB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k9oAAOSwEwhb8zMI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YJwAAOSwQrVb8zML/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aGYAAOSwmepb8zL9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30183", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bdwoody", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 87, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 303.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 303.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 105}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul Classic Solid Body Electric Guitar Black with Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 220, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 308.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
