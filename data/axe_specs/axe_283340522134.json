From the acrylic vine inlay to the instantly-recognizable \"monkey grip\" handle, there's no doubt where the JEMJR Steve Vai Signature came from. For tonal tenacity, you get two Quantum humbuckers and one Quantum single-coil pickup complete with five-way switching. Factor in the double-locking tremolo bridge, and the Ibanez JEMJR Steve Vai Signature is ready to wail. One of Ibanez's fastest necks to date, the Wizard III neck on the JEMJR Steve Vai Signature guitar is an absolute pleasure to play. This slim and super-comfortable neck lets you pull off lighting-fast runs and arpeggios with ease, but still gives you the substance you need for grabbing chords when you need to. From the first time you put your hands on the JEMJR's Wizard III neck, you'll know you've got a guitar that was built with performance in mind. The JEMJR Steve Vai Signature packs Ibanez's standard double-locking bridge, which helps you maintain your tuning stability even after heavy pitch bends.(GR1043012) Payment PayPal is the ONLY online payment method we accept at this time.
