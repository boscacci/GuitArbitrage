{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your consideration is a 1988 USA Jackson San Dimas electric guitar. This one is an awesome player, with a few signs of use, but overall looking really great. The color on the hang tag says it's white with platinum with black \"GUITAR\" lettering. The white has aged over the last 30 years, and has that creamier appearance. Headstock looks great with a few minor nicks and dings, but very minimal. Frets and fretboard look beautiful! The body does have some nicks and dings, including some discoloration near the output jack...pictured. The whammy bar appears to be a replacement. The EMG 81 pickup appears to be a replacement, and the tone knob has been replaced with a Washburn knob. Both the volume pot and the tone pot work perfectly. Although it's pictured with the back tremolo cavity plate off, the plate is included and pictured. Comes with hangtag and original hardshell case. The guitar plays VERY, VERY well and sounds as good as it looks! . WE SHIP FAST!
