{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender American Vintage '72 Telecaster Custom, Made in USA:Fender doesn't make this guitar anymore, and it seems to be getting more rare to find. I do have this listed locally, so the auction may be ended early if it sells locally. Lightly used, comes from a smoke free home and never gigged. It doesn't get played much anymore, so it needs a good home. Has a few tiny nicks and scuffs here and there in the finish, located along the bottom edge. I am showing those in the pics. There is a tiny detectable crease in the wood in the back of the neck in the middle, so minor I couldn't capture it in the pictures. Typical scratches on the pickguard. I would say this guitar is about a 9 out of 10, in terms of condition. Comes with hardshell case that is not original.
