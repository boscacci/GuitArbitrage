{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2013 Fender American Special Telecaster Made In USA Has Tex Mex Pickups Low action, no string buzz New Tusq pre-slotted nut Good frets-slight fret wear starting on first couple of frets. Typical wear scratches. No big dings-some very small ones too small to show up in the pictures. There is a very small ding on the back of the neck at about the 4th fret that looks something like a fingernail edge pushed into the neck slightly. See picture. CTS 250K pots. Vintage Fender wiring. Grounded with Stew Mac conductive grounding paint on the body under the pickguard and on the underside of the pickguard and a ground wire ran to a bridge screw. A small routing under the bridge was made to the bridge screw to accommodate the ground wire so the ground wire would not make the bridge stick up. A small bit of the routing is showing at the edge of the bridge. A steel button string retainer installed and also has the original string retainer. Les Paul style jack plugin. Neck pickup cavity was routed for a P90 pickup. No gig bag no case.I'll bubble wrap it for softer shipping. Fed Ex shipping. SIGNATURE REQUIRED ON DELIVERY.
