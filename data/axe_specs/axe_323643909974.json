{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A truly rare model of the Peavey T-60 in that it's the first in the production line from 1979, hence the \"Patents Applied For\" decal on the headstock, plus the unique original wood coloring and shades. Made in the USA and in excellent condition, the versatility of this solid body axe comes from the pickups which can be single or dual coil output, the pickup phase switch and the three-way pickup switch. This is an ALL ORIGINAL guitar. No mods, replacement parts, drilled holes, or tweaked electronics. Pure Peavey! A few light scuffs on the back (indicated in the pictures) and on the headstock but what do you expect for a 30-year old guitar! No breaks, cracks or repairs. Neck is straight, fretboard and frets only lightly worn, all pots and switches work well to provide the wide variety of tones from this one guitar. The variation in the wood color is what makes this particular T-60 more unique than others. Notice the different grain patterns and shades! Truly individual! Comes from a NON-SMOKING household! And the ORIGINAL Peavey logo'd hard shell, rectangular case is included and in good condition! (Later model years have a guitar shaped case.) One side of the handle is repaired with a zip tie but still functions fine. All latches work well.

The T-60 was the first Peavey production guitar. The original Red Rhodes-designed pickups allows the capability of single or dual coil output. Fully opening the pot to 10 achieves single coil mode. Turning counterclockwise to 7 brings the second coil into operation, and achieving full range humbucker tone. Rotation of the control from 7 to 0 further contours the tone circuit. The Phase switch is a two position switch which reverses the coil relationship in the bridge pickup when the pickup switch is in the middle position: up is in phase, and down is out-of-phase. These guitars are only increasing in value as the years go by. Don't miss this opportunity! (if shipping comes to less, I'll refund the difference. If it's more, I eat it.)", "ItemID": "323643909974", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T20:33:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T21:16:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1979-Peavey-T-60-Electric-Guitar-w-orig-hard-shell-case-/323643909974", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "York, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236439099748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/angAAOSwWdNcNqvI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7ngAAOSwGPNcNqvF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/jA0AAOSwo6NcNqvG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/LBcAAOSwnKFcNqvF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/s4gAAOSw851cNqvG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/2PYAAOSwyUFcNqvH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/8XoAAOSwjolcNqvG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Dd0AAOSwvGZcNqvG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/mgAAAOSwmE9cNqvI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/t54AAOSwrfRcNqvI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/K90AAOSw8zRcNqvH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/9yIAAOSw7MNcNqvF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "17408", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wordman824", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 473, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 585.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 585.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1979 Peavey T-60 Electric Guitar w/ orig hard shell case\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1979"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["T-60"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1979"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}]}, "HitCount": 645, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
