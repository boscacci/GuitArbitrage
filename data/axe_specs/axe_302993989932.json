{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful G&L ASAT DELUXE. It may be time to let her go. I am not able to play it like I would like due to health issues. I hate having it just sitting in the case. I took it to VA. Beach to see if Joe Bonamassa would sign it for me at a meet and greet before the concert in 2010. Not only did he sign it, but he played it. This was for my 50th birthday that\u2019s why it says \u201cHappy 50th\u201d on the back of the headstock. The guitar is in excellent condition, no chips or dents, there may be a few light swirls in the finish. It comes with the original hardshell case. It comes also with the original paperwork. This is a great guitar, Seymour Duncan pickups with coil split. I believe the guitar was made in 2002 but not sure.", "ItemID": "302993989932", "EndTime": "2018-12-22T15:59:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-12T15:59:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-L-ASAT-DELUXE-U-S-A-SIGNED-AND-PLAYED-JOE-BONAMASSA-/302993989932", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Millersville, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029939899328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vmUAAOSwBJVb1mHd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/PiYAAOSwyDpb1mWS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GmQAAOSwW4db1mHi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ly0AAOSw7PJb1mHV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/890AAOSwzIZb1mHX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~KkAAOSwo3Bb1mHZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDAz/z/I7gAAOSw5Spb1mHe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTE5/z/Wv8AAOSw5Qtb1mHg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YPQAAOSw~ydb1mHh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D0cAAOSw2X5b1mHa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kbEAAOSwSTpb1mHb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yqAAAOSw8cFb1mZF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "21108", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cosmo88", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 158, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 37, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1075.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1075.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 87}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G&L ASAT DELUXE U.S.A.
