{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ibanez 1977 \u2018lawsuit\u2019 Johnny Smith 2461BS Archtop This guitar was purchased new from a dealer many years ago. It has remained unplayed and is very close to being a new instrument. Over time the gold has minimal tarnishing or wear from trying to keep it clean and the binding has minimal surface crazing. This could very well be one of the nicest 2461 guitars available. Body size at lower bout: 17\" Scale length: 25\" Nut width: 1 11/16\" Materials: Three-piece solid maple neck with adjustable truss rod; book matched arched spruce top; figured maple back and sides; solid ebony fingerboard and compensated bridge; mother of pearl block fingerboard inlay and peghead inlay; 5-ply body, headstock and pickguard binding, triple bound fingerboard, bound f-holes Hardware: 100% original gold hardware includes art-deco gold-plated tailpiece and tuners, original ebony adjustable compensated bridge with inlaid feet, bound tortoise pickguard with twin floating mini-humbucking pickups, with 3 way rotary pickup selector and independent volume and tone controls, 1/8\u201d mini jack output under pickguard. Notes: In the early 70's Ibanez set out to make high-precision replicas of Gibson's top-end instruments. So successful were they that Gibson sued to stop production, which was subsequently halted under court order. Now known as 'lawsuit' models, these guitars have become legendary for their rarity, and their scrupulous faithfulness to the originals. Meticulously constructed, this guitar, model 2461BS, is virtually identical in dimensions, scale and bracing to its Gibson namesake. The solid ebony fingerboard is inlaid with pearl split block inlays , and the body shows particularly handsome bookmatched tiger flame in the back and sides. Fitted with all original gold hardware, the guitar has the rare twin floating mini-humbucking pickups, with 3 way rotary pickup selector and independent volume and tone controls. This instrument has a comfortable modern neck profile and is an all-time favorite of working pros, who prefer to leave their spendy originals at home.
