{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Seasons Greetings! For consideration, a classic players grade 12 stringer from the Eko stable, circa 1970. This is the solidly built, disaster-proof, original Ranger model with the nice golden 'bubble' logo on the headstock and the older style and very attractive burled mahogany body, made in Recanati, Italy. The old stager has seen some action on her tour of duty, recently stopped by our place for a travellers rest and some TLC and now its over to you. So, there are some good things about this guitar, I shall start with the not so good...... There are areas of wear to the lacquer as expected for the age. Also some lacquer lines/checks/cracks on the soundboard, just in the varnish lacquer and quite common to see on these models, we have sealed these but not refinished them, see photo's. There is a bridge system installed to maintain the low action and soundboard integrity. Hence this is being described a 'players grade guitar.....' Plays well and sounds magnificent. and a great guitar if you can man up to it, or woman up to it! Should be able to woman up to things in the 21st century I say!! Anyhow, now fully overhauled and professionally set up, she plays well with a low action, straight neck, new D'Addario quality strings and is a generally fine guitar, more than ready for take two.
