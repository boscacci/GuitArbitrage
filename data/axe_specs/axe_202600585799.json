{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a used Fender '57 American Vintage reissue electric guitar in ocean turquoise, with glossy 21-fret maple fretboard, Fender tremolo and OHSC (tweed) with all orig case candy. Guitar was bought new in 2008 and has had only one owner. It has been played and gigged across the last 10 years and has some corresponding wear to the gloss of the paint and the pick guard. The neck, fretboard and headstock are all in excellent condition. The body has a few small dings, about 1/8\" in width, indicated in the photos. The back of the guitar body has some wear to the finish from dozens of hours of playing on stage, although I don't play with a belt buckle, so it's mainly dulling of the finish and not paint worn off to show the bare wood underneath. I have attempted to show the dulling of the finish on the back in the photos. The guitar has had regular maintenance and professional intonation work etc. through the years. The guitar has not been dropped, banged or repaired. All parts are original from 2008 (except the strings of course). The guitar plays great and has a classic Fender chime imho through a clean channel. The frets are thinner than the common \"medium jumbo\" frets often found on modern stratocasters - not a problem, just a difference that may take some getting used to. Comes with the original Fender tweed case, tremolo bar, \"ashtray\" bridge pick-up cover and original case candy. The case has a few blemishes and minor handling marks on the outside. Also, one of the clasps is bent a bit (see photo) but it still works (and the plastic cover is still on the brass). Inside of the case is in mint condition. When not being played out, the guitar has been stored in a smoke-free climate-controlled environment. For shipment to the winning bidder, the guitar will be packed securely in its case, and the case packed securely with bubble wrap and other protective material in a large heavy duty cardboard box. Email me with any questions and good luck bidding!
