{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2014 Mexican Fender Stratocaster Deluxe What I have for sale is a Fender Stratocaster. It is used but all electronics are still in proper working order. It does have a little wear to it from use. It has a few marks around the edges but nothing major, mainly scuffs. I do not really see any scuffing from being played with a pick. it may need a new set of strings soon as they have sat a while without being played. Again this guitar is in very good cosmetic condition but does have a few minor marks in spots. it does come with the gig bag (Bag has tears in it) and paperwork that came with it. it comes exactly as shown in the pictures above.
