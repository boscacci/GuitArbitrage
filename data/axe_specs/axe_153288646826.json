{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Perfect for Christmas! A gorgeous, professional quality electric guitar and Peavey Vyper VIP1 amp included. Plug and play on Christmas morning! NO RESERVE! Our boy learned to play with this setup and is now moving from his hard rock phase to a blues rock phase and needs a new setup for that. That makes this killer hard rock setup available to you as a package. Both the guitar and the amp features are described below. Guitar cost new: $850-$950 (Guitar Center) Condition: Both the guitar and amp are used, but have been lovingly cared for. The amp is basically in perfect condition. The guitar has a small number of barely noticeable scuffs and a tiny ding on the quilted top in the spot your wrist would be when playing. See pics for details on both the guitar and amp. All cords are included. *NOTE: I took the guitar outside for pics to show off the color. It\u2019s never been outside otherwise. GUITAR: This is a 2008 SCHECTER Diamond Series Hellraiser Special C-1 in Black Cherry w/EMG Active CoilTap & Floyd Rose tremolo/whammy bar.

Now for the first time ever using our Variable Instrument Input, a single amp can provide amplification for a variety of instrument types. Not only does the amplifier morph from a bass amp to an acoustic amp to an electric amp, it also (for the first time ever in an amplifier in this category) allows the electric guitar player access to instrument models as well. The VYPYR combines Peavey's exclusive TransTube\u00ae analog circuitry with a powerful 32-bit, floating point SHARC processor to deliver uncompromised tone, making the VYPYR series the best sounding modeling amplifiers available. All VYPYR effects, amp models and parameter controls can be accessed via the amp itself, with no need to hook the amplifier to a computer. Peavey's WYSIWYG control surface quickly allows the user the ability to see and adjust the control position -- no guessing where the control is supposed to be or having to manually move it to where it should be from preset to preset. VYPYR's new USB bi-directional data and audio port provides an easy way to record and/or connect to our VYPYR software and store presets, get lessons, and practice to backing tracks while connected to your computer. The VYPYR VIP series gives you all of the revolutionary features from the original VYPYR series, now even better. More power, more effects, more amp models, Variable Instrument Input, instrument models, and more make this the ultimate amplifier.
