{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello eBay Friends! For sale today we have a used 1997 Ibanez JEM Steve Vai Signature Electric Guitar w/ Blue Floral Pattern Design with FREE SHIPPING! (Serial Number: 916562) This guitar was personally autographed for me by Steve Vai in 1997 when I worked at Lentine's Music in Cleveland, Ohio (see pictures for this). Guitar is in good condition, plays very smooth and I have been the only only owner. Guitar will be shipped WITH insurance and tracking information to insure delivery and value. Please note the following full disclosures on the guitar (see pictures for details): #1: Floyd Rose tremolo will need a real good professional cleaning, works fine now but a good cleaning would be a good idea and potentially replacing the little \"blocks\" that hold the strings may be in order. #2: Since this guitar is from 1997 the front and the back of the neck have \"Aged\" as you can see in the pictures, no issues but they don't look brand new. #3: Frets have been worn down a bit, again the guitar plays fine but down the road their might be a consideration of getting a fret job done. #4: Guitar does have substantial wear on the back plate and regular wear the the knobs. Overall the original Blue Floral color on the guitar is still in decent condition. #5: The Ibanez Hardshell Case middle lock is broken and does not work but the far left and right clasps do \"Clasp\" just fine. Buy with confidence, I have a 100% PERFECT eBay selling score! All reasonable bid offers considered and same day or next day 9:00 AM shipping happens with instant verified Pay Pal payment. I sell internationally with the Global Shipping Program. Please note that after it reaches the eBay international shipping location for shipping overseas you will have to pay shipping from that point forward. I pay the free shipping to get it to the eBay international shipping location. Customs regulations vary by country and not all carriers ship to all locations.

Byron Nemeth OVERVIEW Contoured basswood body with high-speed neck and DiMarzio pickups. Steve Vai is one of the revered few on that short list of players who have changed the way we all think about what a guitar can really do. His signature Ibanez guitars are no different: iconic, sublime, awe-inspiring, and outrageous.\u2028\u2028The Ibanez JEM/UV Series is a spectacular instrument that features a contoured basswood body and a 5-piece maple and walnut bolt-on neck that provides easy access to all registers. A 24-fret maple fingerboard is adorned with a colorful \"Tree of Life\" pattern inlay and has the high-speed JEM Premium profile that gives Steve Vai the playability he needs.\u2028\u2028The JEM77P sports Cosmo Black hardware and includes Steve's \"Monkey Grip\" handle cut on the body. The JEM77P is loaded with a pair of DiMarzio Gravity Storm humbuckers and a DiMarzio Evolution single-coil in the middle position. This pickup combination with 5-way selector switch features a wide sound variety of great tones needed for modern rock. The acclaimed Edge Zero II tremolo features lower profiled design for playing comfort and locking studs contribute to tuning stability. Hardshell case included.
