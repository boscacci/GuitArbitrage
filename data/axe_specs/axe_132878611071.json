{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The Joe Trohman Washburn Idol WI26 is a modern single-cutaway style electric guitar. Tones ranging from punishing to pristine spring from dual humbucker pickups and the innovative Voice Contour Control. VCC is a unique coil-splitting system that allows you to incrementally blend humbucking and single-coil pickup sounds without the hum normally associated with single-coils. The solid mahogany body has a wide-yet-thin profile that is lightweight and well-balanced. The set maple neck has a fast profile, comfortable neck joint, rosewood fretboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, and Grover tuners to keep you in tune.\"I spent a long time putting this guitar together, making it something that really represented me as a guitar player. This is the result and I'm so pleased with it. The fact that Washburn presented this opportunity in the first place means the world to me, and now I got to work with great people to create something I truly love. I'm a guitar player, and I'm obsessed with every inch, every nook, every aspect of guitars in general. I put my stamp whole heartedly on this guitar, knowing that it fully kicks ass and surpasses my standards. I'm excited to make it available to everyone out there. Enjoy it, it will bring you riffs galore.\" - Joe (from Fall Out Boy) FEATURES Mahogany bodyVoice Contour Control (VCC) coil-splitting systemWB630 high-output humbuckersOne-piece set maple neckRosewood fingerboard with keyhole inlays24-3/4\" neck scale22 frets14\" fingerboard radius42.5mm nut widthAdjustable bridge with stop tailpieceGrover 18:1 gear ratio tuners2 volume and 2 tone controls3-way pickup selector *Shipping in USA Only!***Auction is for item pictured, if its not in the picture it doesn't come with it.*****Please Message With Any Questions Before Purchasing.**", "ItemID": "132878611071", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T01:20:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T18:35:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-Joe-Trohman-Fall-Out-Boy-Idol-Series-WI26-Electric-Guitar-/132878611071", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "West Covina, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328786110718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU2MFg5NDk=/z/dyUAAOSwwj5b31N-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3OFg4MTM=/z/t7cAAOSwo3Fb30ly/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1Nlg4NjE=/z/wI0AAOSw1uVb30mM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sKwAAOSwHnJb30mc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7XAAAOSwTVlb30ms/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pMkAAOSw44db30pq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4X4AAOSwHStb30sE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/75AAAOSwTVlb30sh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UjoAAOSwMO9b30sw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9NIAAOSwEOJb30tA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5FsAAOSwcFlb30uA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bMMAAOSwBYFb30tx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "91790", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mrleo777", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 620, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn Joe Trohman (Fall Out Boy) Idol Series WI26 Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["WI26"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 93, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=15843271", "StoreName": "Goodfellas Pawn Shop"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "good overall condition with light scuffs on the front and a few scratches on the back", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
