{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Dimebag Darrell is well respected for having one of the greatest tones of all time. His legacy lives on with the Dimebag Razorback DB Electric Guitar. The body has an eye-catching, yet well-balanced design. The maple neck boasts a rosewood fretboard with a pearl razor inlay at the twelfth fret to evoke Dime's famous necklace. Dean-designed humbucker pickups unleash vicious tone that's sure to put a smile on any Dimebag fan's face. This very affordable Dimebag Razorback DB Electric Guitar is finished off with black hardware, Grover tuners, a tune-o-matic bridge and Dimebag traction knobs. It's surprisingly comfortable when you sit down to play it. This beauty can handle any tuning you give it, but if you continue to go lower, then it tends to slip out of tune sometimes. There are no cracks in the guitar and there are no signs that the guitar has ever been repaired. However there are three places where the paint has been touched up.
