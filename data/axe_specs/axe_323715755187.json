{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For Sale is 2015 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe complete with Lollar Mini Humbuckers. This beautiful freaking guitar is a true joy to play. She has been upgraded with an RS Guitarworks harness as well. The Lollar pickups are some of the most beautiful sounding pickups I have ever heard. They are so organic sounding through my AC15. And when you dial the tone down, your tonal palette is just opened up to whole new levels. The guitar itself is in amazing shape. The top is flawless and the back has light marks in it, that are only finish deep. They are hard to photograph as they are near invisible, but I wanted to disclose anyways. She has a beautiful headstock commemorating Les Paul, the man himself. Some people get deterred by the 2015 headstock, but the expanded fretboard and neck profile really do make a world of difference in playability. I challenge you to find a better guitar than this one. The Tuners have been upgraded to Klusons, but the original G force tuners will be included. She will be packed in a Gibson Gold case, and shipped fast with care for you to rock out immediately!
