{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar is a MIM Jaguar pairing a Kurt Cobain Jaguar body with a Fender Classic Player Jaguar neck. The fretboard is pao ferro and has been darkened by a couple of applications of 3-in-1 oil. It looks more like a dark rosewood neck, which looks much richer than the standard pao ferro fretboard. The pickups in this guitar are Lace Sensor Duallys. The bridge pickup is a red/blue and the neck is a gold/blue. I put mini-switches for each pickup on the upper horn. These mini-switches allow you to use the bridge-side pickup, the neck-side pickup, or both together. The standard switch on the upper horn is a bass-cut switch like on a Johnny Marr Jaguar. The pickup switch is a 4-way switch, also like on a Johnny Marr Jaguar. The four positions are bridge only, bridge and neck out of phase, neck only, bridge and neck in phase. The volume and tone controls on the upper horn are active. The function of the volume up top is the same as the main volume, but the tone control up top has a .003uf capacitor (same as on the bass cut switch). This, in combination with the bass cut switch, allows you to vary the tone of the neck pickup (and switch positions that use the neck pickup). This works fantastic! With all of the pickup selection and switching tools, this guitar is a tone generating machine. It can get a wide variety of tones. If you are really into modifying your tone for different styles of music, you would have a ball with this guitar. It is a lot less expensive than a Johnny Marr Jaguar, and more versatile in my opinion. Both the body and neck on this guitar look like new. The tremolo unit has a device on it to create a deeper string break before the bridge. You will also notice that the bridge is the black chrome one from the Kurt Cobain Jaguar model, which looks pretty cool with the Black Lace Sensors. This guitar comes in a backpack-style gig bag. This guitar is more fun than a barrel of monkeys! I would love to keep it, but I am helping my wife pay off my Guitar Center bill, so my loss is your gain! This guitar will be sold in the Contiguous US only. Payment by PayPal only. View my feedback and bid with confidence!
