{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gently used AEL30SE Acoustic Electric Guitar and Kaces Polyfoam Case and extra set of new D'Addario Strings. Owner's home is smoke-free and pet-free and air-conditioned. Guitar is in very good used condition with minor surface imperfections - the photos from my iphone do not do it justice with the light reflection. Guitar stand is NOT included, but the Kaces #KGB-20NB back pack case and new D'Addario EJ16 Light Phosphor Bronze strings ARE included. I will ship it carefully packed in the original shipping box. This Ibanez sounds great to my ear. Lots of projection and volume with a bright sound, especially when you put the new strings on! Excellent design and style. Onboard tuner, gold colored tuning machines, abalone rosette, Fishman preamp works well and guitar has lots of features. Well made. This is a lot of guitar for the price. Description from Ibanez:The Ibanez AEL30SE Acoustic Electric Guitar is a big-bodied guitar with volume to match its size. Equipped with a Fishman Sonicore pickup coupled with an Ibanez AEQ-SST Shape Shifter preamp, the AEL30SE is ready to perform in acoustic or electric environments. The built-in tuner offers easy and discrete mid-set tuning.The solid Engelmann spruce top produces a lot of projection with tight, articulate sound that is modulated and warmed by the big mahogany body and neck. Cosmetics include an intricate abalone rosette and fret block inlays.The Ivorex II nut is stronger and more durable than bone and even harder than the original Ivorex. It permits brilliant highs and more pronounced lows with less mid-range that makes Ivorex II-fitted guitars perfect for amplification.FEATURES AEL Body Mahogany Neck, back and sides Solid Engelmann spruce top Abalone Rosette Ibanez die-cast tuners Fishman Sonicore Pickup Ibanez AEQ-SST Shape Shifter Preamp with Onboard Tuner Balanced 1/4\" and XLR Outputs Rosewood Bridge and Fretboard Ivorex II Nut and Saddle Advantage Bridge Pins D'Addario EXP Strings Case sold separatelySPECIFICATIONSBody dimensions AEL Body Style 16\" width 5\" depth 20\" length Neck dimensions 25.5\" scale 1.69\" nut width.
