{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Feast your eyes on a 2008 SE Singlecut in very good condition. A very unusual honeyburst. There are the usual 2 humbuckers with a 3 way switch, volume and tone. They are clear and beefy, and take distortion very well. The guitar will be shipped with a one piece bridge, but with the locking Schroeder studs. You can feel the vibrations when you strum a chord because of them. The koa truss rod cover will also be included. The original tuners are spotless, as is all the chrome on the guitar. Aside from a few random pick swirls, there are no scratches or chips on the top of the guitar. The back is also extremely clean with no buckle rash. The neck mahogany has incredible grain, and I can't find the seams to tell how many pieces it has. Sadly, there is a scratch on the edge of the top where the veneer meets the side, near the bass bout. I took a close up of it. You can only see the flaw diagonally. Shipping will be UPS ground, insured, after October 13th. I will be away until then. CONUS only. No first time or foreign buyers because of past problems. As always, all sales are final. This item is relisted due to a non-paying buyer.", "ItemID": "113336905048", "EndTime": "2018-11-05T03:48:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T03:48:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-PRS-SE-Singlecut-Honeyburst-/113336905048", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Washington, District Of Columbia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1133369050488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2IAAAOSwaPRal4iH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/keAAAOSwvs9al4hT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yasAAOSwMS1al4hH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lNEAAOSwl~Val4ie/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/69gAAOSwKRdal4hk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZRsAAOSwgltal4i8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Xj0AAOSwtndal4h2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eAcAAOSwfdBal4jI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rUAAAOSwuoxal4ja/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FocAAOSwK5Jal4jw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UEIAAOSwHuhal4j9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CCgAAOSwYl9al4kN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "20010", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dogrocketp", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1430, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 339.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 339.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith PRS SE Singlecut- Honeyburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SingleCut"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 88, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 344.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
