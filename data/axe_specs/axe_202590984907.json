{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Back in 1979, Epiphone decided to release a double cutaway that could hold its own with the Les Paul at an affordable price. The Epiphone Limited Edition Genesis Deluxe Pro is a recreation of this collector's favorite. The Genesis Deluxe Pro combines a solid mahogany body with an AAA flame maple veneer. The double cutaway body features 1-ply cream binding on the top for a vintage look. The mahogany neck has a 24.75\" scale with a 12\" radius and features a 1960s SlimTaper \"D\" profile, with a glued-in neck joint. The rosewood fingerboard comes with pearloid trapezoid inlays, 22 medium-jumbo frets and a 1.68\" nut along with single ply cream binding along the fingerboard. Originally the Genesis featured coil-tapping for both pickups with a single switch. Now Epiphone offers coil-tapping for each individual pickup, and ProBucker pickups provide a hotter PAF sound. The original vintage look is maintained with the AAA flame maple veneer on a solid mahogany double cutaway body, and features a 1-ply cream binding. Other features include gold hardware, a LockTone Tune-o-matic fully adjustable bridge and a stopbar tailpiece. Epiphone's patent pending design auto locks the bridge and tailpiece in place with no tools needed, and also results in improved sustain, 1\" diameter potentiometers for better \"throw,\" longer life and reliable service. The all-metal toggle switch uses rugged spring-steel contacts to ensure years of reliable service and performance. Gold Grover 14:1 machine heads on a classic '60s era Epiphone \"Sloped Dovewing\" headstock ensure tuning stability. This guitar is in mint condition and looks like it was only played for a few hours if at all. PayPal only please. Please pay within three days of auction end.
