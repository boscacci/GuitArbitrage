{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "My pics are of actual guitar for sale other than the photo of Japan brochure from 1989 that gives spec details of this guitar. Real tweed used fender case included. Guitar is in excellent condition with minor wear/dings for a 29 yr old guitar. No issues other than it\u2019s missing the whammy bar and the back cover plate. Neck is straight, truss turns, tuners rock. It really is a killer guitar and I hate to have to sell this but it\u2019s sat in closet for 2 years and I need to consolidate some inventory. USA pickups from factory sound incredible, i love the feel of the V shape neck, the frets are in great condition and plays/bends almost effortlessly. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s alder or ash body? Brochure says it\u2019s one of the two wood styles that were available in 89. The stamp appears faded in the neck pocket area and unrecognizable. There are no issues with the electronics, it has 5 way tone switch, not a 3 way. Clean tone pots. I don\u2019t know any history of the guitar or previous ownership but doesn\u2019t appear to have been modded or altered. This was a top of line vintage model true to Leo 54 spec so it really didn\u2019t need any changes. What you see in pics is what you get & I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love this guitar. It\u2019s reviews speak for themselves if you search the Strat MIJ ST54 reissue. Will have new strings & ready to play on arrival. Fast free shipping US 48 states only & will be insured. I only deliver to the PayPal address provided at checkout. Thanks for looking & ask any questions for details I may have forgotten to list.", "ItemID": "183609249907", "EndTime": "2018-12-30T15:55:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-28T22:15:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/RARE-Strat-1989-Burst-Fender-Stratocaster-MIJ-japan-54-Reissue-/183609249907", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Murphysboro, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836092499078080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cWMAAOSw651cJp-e/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3MFg3MTM=/z/ZOEAAOSwK0tcJp-O/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU0MFgxNjAw/z/n9UAAOSwjlVcJp-V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/clUAAOSwEUdcJp-c/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Gy0AAOSwFs1cJp-h/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcw/z/~YMAAOSwkFZcJp-b/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/E3QAAOSwwTFcJqcx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r1wAAOSw4otcJqbo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mjg=/z/9M8AAOSwqKNcJqcN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NzQ=/z/3fEAAOSwKOZcJp-Z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9EcAAOSw0TBcJp-R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MTI=/z/BGUAAOSwikBcJp-P/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "62966", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jtwait74", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 160, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 19}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "RARE Strat 1989 Burst Fender Stratocaster MIJ japan 54 Reissue", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1989"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ST54-115"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Burst"]}]}, "HitCount": 232, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
