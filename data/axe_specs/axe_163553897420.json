{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a SUPER COOL Fender Squier Stratocaster made in 2007! As you can see in the pictures, the white finish on this guitar has aged beautifully into a vintage-looking cream color, which just looks awesome! Another important thing to note is that it's a Squier, but the older ones are built WAY BETTER than the newer ones. The newer Squiers are paper light and feel cheap - this one weighs in at an IMPRESSIVE 8lbs, and as most of you know, a solid, weighty guitar gives you better tone and sustain through the amp! Structurally this guitar is in great shape. The tuners hold tune well, the intonation is right, the neck is straight, and the guitar plays well. The fret surfaces are in great shape. The edges of the frets look like a mess, but as you'll see / hear in the VIDEO referenced below, every fret plays clearly - no dead frets or buzzing. Also, BRAND NEW STRINGS were just put on this week. Cosmetically, the guitar is in good condition. There are some minor scrapes here and there and a ding down by the bottom strap button, but overall it's just a great-looking guitar. To see a VIDEO of this piece being tested and played, search OCSquier12345 on YouTube and it will come right up! Included with this guitar is the originally whammy bar, a cool guitar strap, and a VERY well-padded gig bag (case) with large pockets and shoulder straps for easy carrying! I'm selling this guitar at NO RESERVE so BID NOW!", "ItemID": "163553897420", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T00:14:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T00:14:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Fender-Squier-Electric-Guitar-Case-Strap-VIDEO-NO-RESERVE-/163553897420", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Union, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635538974208080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNVg4MTg=/z/KRcAAOSw78xcbJnB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTc2WDE0NjY=/z/9EgAAOSwotZcbJnE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzYyWDEwOTg=/z/fWMAAOSwXL1cbJnG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDY0WDE1MDA=/z/USoAAOSwYyVcbJnI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzE0WDEyNTA=/z/m0wAAOSwA4VcbJnM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMyWDE0NjY=/z/w4MAAOSwoG1cbJnO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzgyWDEyMTQ=/z/mhEAAOSwZ65cbJnQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzUwWDE0NTg=/z/JNIAAOSww4JcbJnR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzI1WDk1NA==/z/zXYAAOSwstNcbJnU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "07083", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "violetroses28", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 288, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 37, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 180.27, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 180.27, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Fender Squier Electric Guitar WITH Case + Strap (+VIDEO) - NO RESERVE!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 503, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 182.77, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
