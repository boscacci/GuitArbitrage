{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Looks as though this maybe a MIJ fujigen make from my research so far. Mateo was the brand name given to guitars built by Fujigen and brought in by the distributor back in the '70s for Music West.( Electra). Somewhat likely to be affiliated with Hoshino(Fujigen)It's this intricate relationship between distributor (Hoshino), brand (Ibanez) and factory (Fujigen). Fujigen is known to have produced guitars with these brands during the 1970s:Greco/Ibanez/Antoria/Electa/Crestwood/Carlo Robelli/Yamaha/Epiphone Mateo. They also built some with the name brand 'Mateo' it's probably Matsumoku, because of their different size neck plate etc.... Here we have I can honestly describe as an all-round KILLER vintage 72 RI Strat. This example is by the expert luthiers at Japan's highlty respected Fujigen factory. This classic looking strat was made in Japan in 1979 and is an exact copy of the coveted RARE 4-bolt 1972 strat which is out there but quite rare very few were made. This one is DEAD on with its accurate deep belly cut countour body and its well aged yet thin & still glossy with its well broken looks & feel is a warm classic strat all the way ..just have a good look..the wear & patina you can only get from being a real vintage guitar its over 33 years old now and having been great really played feel to it is not by accident. This beauty weights in at a svelt 8 lbs...the fast neck is a perfect 1-5/8\" at the nut and is in absolute top form fully functioning and nice and straight with very good frets it plays excellently and is READY to ROCK, frets & finish are really beautiful.
