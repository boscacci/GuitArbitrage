{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Hamer Echotone that's had some considerable upgrades. I acquired it in a trade roughly 5-6 years ago. The standard bridge has been replaced with a Bigsby Trem, the electronics have been upgraded with 335 controls from RS Guitarworks [https://rs-guitarworks.myshopify.com/collections/pre-wired-kits/products/pre-wired-vintage-335-upgrade-kit], and the stock pickups were replaced with Manlius T-Tops [https://www.manliusguitar.com/products/t-top-replica]. It plays extremely well and sounds great. It's in good overall physical condition. The biggest physical defect is the input jack was moved from the bottom of the guitar to the front of the body, similar to what you would see on an ES-335. The fill and paint job given to the old jack mounting hole isn't the greatest work, but being positioned on the bottom it isn't visible in the playing position, and you probably wouldn't notice it unless you set out looking for it. Hardshell case is included. It's a great guitar. I've gone back to school and money is tight or I wouldn't be getting rid of it. If you have any questions feel free to ask; I'll do my best to answer them, though I feel like I know less about this guitar than most I've had over the years for some reason.
