{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Payment | **READ BEFORE BIDDING** *MINT 1988 FENDER TELECASTER ELECTRIC GUITAR BLONDE w/CASE & PAPERS* A MINTY EXAMPLE HERE OF A 1988 FENDER TELECASTER THAT WAS MADE TO COMMEMORATE THE 1952. THE GUITAR WAS PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNER WHO BOUGHT THIS BACK IN 1989 WHEN HE DECIDED TO LEARN THE GUITAR. NEEDLES TO SAY, HIS VENTURE DIDN'T LAST LONG AS THIS GUITAR SAW VERY LITTLE USE! THE GUITAR IS REALLY QUITE BEAUTIFUL AND SHOWS A COUPLE OF TINY BRUISES AND SURFACE MARKS THAT ARE HARDLY WORTH MENTIONING. THERE ARE SOME SPOTS OF LACQUER LOSS ON THE REVERSE LOWER SECTION OF THE NECK AS INDICATED BY RED ARROWS, BUT NOTHING SERIOUS. THE GUITAR NEEDS A NEW SET OF STRINGS AND TUNING AS SHE'S GOOD TO GO WITH PERFECT NECK. COMES COMPLETE WITH ORIGINAL CASE, EXTRA PARTS AND PAPERS AS WHEN PURCHASED. **SCROLL DOWN FOR ALL IMAGES****NO SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S.****SHIPPING FED/EX GROUND OR U.S.P.S.
