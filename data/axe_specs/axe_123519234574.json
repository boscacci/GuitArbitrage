{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a used Jackson electric guitar comes with a strap, a case, a cleaning pad, 3 screws, and a pick. The guitar is clean and works properly (I didn't find any problems when I played it). You might say it has subtle signs of use (I think it's clean as new) but it doesn't have any major noticeable scratch or damage. Unfortunately, I could not find information about what model this guitar is on the internet, but according to the website I found it it a model which was made in Japan in around 1998. (https://www.jcfonline.com/archive/index.php/t-51169.html) Also, this guitar might be custom designed since I could not find any image of the same design on the internet. The case is black, made in Canada, and also used. It functions properly as a case. Apparently, the material used for its surface is tolex, not a real leather. The case has signs of use. You can see some of the damages in the images. I feel one of the 3 locks is slightly loose. These are all the flaws and descriptions of the item I can think of. If you have any questions please let me know!", "ItemID": "123519234574", "EndTime": "2018-12-07T11:50:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-30T11:50:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/USED-Jackson-electric-guitar-black-made-in-Canada-case-and-extras-/123519234574", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nanaimo, British Columbia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235192345748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/B4AAAOSwBMpcARQN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/En4AAOSwxG9cARP8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oOIAAOSwa1hcARQO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YqQAAOSw7thcARQP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/trYAAOSwBZBcARQK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-DIAAOSwtFlcARP7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y2sAAOSwLeFcARQC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TkIAAOSwnv9cARQI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aJsAAOSwe9VcARQN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~RIAAOSw0xtcARQA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LVAAAOSwP8dcARQH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2QoAAOSwxZxcARQD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "V9S 2N6", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "k0hei131", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 7, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 187.04, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 248.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 188}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "USED Jackson electric guitar + a black made-in-Canada case and extras", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 154, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 250.5, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
