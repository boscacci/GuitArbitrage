I jotted down everything I could in this post, if you have any questions for something I may not have mentioned please do not hesitate to pm me!* ___________________________________________________ This Fender American Vintage '52 Telecaster takes you back to 1952, a time when solidbody electric guitars were new, and forging music's electric future. This guitar has that famously fat maple neck, and that famously fat tone. This guitar has all the vibe of the original '52 Tele, built to the original specs. This 2012 Fender American Vintage '52 Telecaster is different from the AVR Teles from previous years. For this one, Fender tracked down several of the original '52s and exhaustively analyzed them to ensure a painstaking level of vintage accuracy. Every facet of the original instruments, including minute details such as curves, perimeters, radii and more, was examined, measured, evaluated, and ultimately incorporated into this American Vintage '52 Tele. What you see in this remarkable guitar is more than the sum of its parts. It's a highly playable recreation of an iconic instrument that changed music forever. Features include: - Fabulously chunky U-profile maple neck - Ash Body - Fender Flash Coat nitrocellulose lacquer Butterscotch Blonde finish - Maple Neck - Maple, 7.25\" radius fretboard - American Vintage '52 single-coil pickups - Single-line \"Fender Deluxe\" vintage-style tuners - String-through hardtail Bridge/Tailpiece with three compensated brass saddles - Master Volume, Master Tone, 3-way pickup selector - Sculpted headstock volute for enhanced first-position comfort - Comes with tweed case ___________________________________________________ I purchased this AVRI telecaster 2 years ago back in 2016, and have gigged with it consistently since. It had been my #2 live guitar, but I am looking for something new. Everything you see above are the true specs to the guitar, but there\u2019s a few other things I should mention: - The guitar has natural relic. \u201852 reissues have a much thinner finish on them so that this can happen. It\u2019s all about the \u201cold school\u201d road-worn look for these reissues. - May need to replace the nut. The high e string buzzes when playing the string open (kind of a sitar sound). I have tried to adjust the action and truss rod but those haven\u2019t solved the problem. - Missing volume knob, and the pickup switch cap is white - from a strat. A simple parts purchase from your local music store can replace these. From everything above, the only issue you will come across with this guitar is the nut for the buzzing high e string. You may also want to go get the guitar setup if you decide to purchase. I would do it myself, but there\u2019s no point in getting it setup to my standards and selling it to someone who has different preferences than mine. The guitar plays very well & it\u2019s one of my favorite I\u2019ve ever owned.", "ItemID": "113347303040", "EndTime": "2018-12-30T03:38:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-02T20:15:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-Fender-American-Vintage-52-Reissue-Telecaster-Tweed-OHSC-/113347303040", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Strongsville, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1133473030408080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n3MAAOSwVBRb3K2s/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yywAAOSwQrVb3K2q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sKsAAOSwr-Bb3K2z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IXsAAOSwWW5b3K2n/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MVMAAOSwEcxb3K2u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wpwAAOSwlKRb3K2o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oDIAAOSw0QBb3K2x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wAMAAOSwsptb3K23/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hEYAAOSw5qdb3K21/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6kIAAOSwpwBb3K2v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "44136", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chase_franklin", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 148, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1080.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1080.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 920}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2012 Fender American Vintage \u201852 Reissue Telecaster With Tweed OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}]}, "HitCount": 751, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
