{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "VERY GOOD CONDITION, GREAT PLAYER! KOREAN QUALITY! NOT made in Indonesia or China. This is an EPIPHONE FLYING V ELECTRIC GUITAR. Serial number I060315xx. Made in Korea, MIK in the Saein plant, March of 2006. 100% complete and original. The top and back of the guitar are nice, with extremely light handling scratches and some polish swirl. There are light dings around the body edges. The back of the neck is perfectly SMOOTH! The frets and finger board look NEAR NEW! Not much wear for a 10 year old guitar. First class guitar, not stamped 'used' or '2nd' like so many here on ebay. It comes with the SKB canvas hard case you see in the pictures. See the serial number on the back of the headstock. Interestingly, the last two numbers are 58 and it is a '58 reissue. Features include... gold hardware, Grover tuners, 22 fret maple neck, rosewood fingerboard with dot markers, two original humbucker pickups, three way PU selector switch, tun-o-matic bridge, stop tailpiece, natural finish body, three ply white pick guard. The body is mahogany with korina top and back. It is beautiful, and SOUNDS GREAT!!! Professionally set up. Everything works as it should... electronics, truss rod, bridge, tuners, etc. The controls are clean and not scratchy. I have serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the neck and body, cleaned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the frets, 9-42 strings, adjusted bridge/truss rod/intonation, etc. She is ready to play and PLAYS GREAT!!Buyer pays $44.95 shipping, insurance, packaging and handling to lower 48 states.
