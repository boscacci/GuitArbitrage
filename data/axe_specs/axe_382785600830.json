{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1979 Gibson Les Paul Custom Silverburst All Original Electric Guitar w/Case Click images to enlarge Description I have owned this guitar since 1981. My father traded it to a friend of ours from Pittsburgh Pa for a 1928-1929 Model A Ford Tudor Sedan Body. He had just purchased the guitar new about 9 months earlier. I was 15 years old. I am proud of how nice I have kept this guitar. 4-bands, 4-years of college, and countless jams and practices. It is in GREAT Shape with minor worming and dinks and donks (most of them on the back). It is 100% original!!! Nothing has been changed and that is the original 1979 case. This is the Deepest-Darkest Les Paul I have ever heard. This is not Buzz Box like some of the newer ones. It definitely has is own voice. Perfect working condition. The case is in good condition and all of the hinges - latches work. Feel free to call me with any questions (330) 872-1932 Brian Get images that make Supersized seem small.Tailor your auctions with Auctiva's Listing Templates! THE simple solution for eBay sellers.
