{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2008 Ernie Ball Music Man Axis Super Sport HH with a Balboa Blue Burst Quilt finish. This is a fantastic playing guitar with a beautiful quilt top and is loaded with premium features. It weighs in at a light 7.39 pounds and has a beautiful roasted maple satin neck. The Quilt top is also a premium upgraded option. It has just been setup with new strings and the frets have been polished to a bright shine. This EBMM is in very good condition with some typical wear from a few years of playing. The top has a lot of light surface swirls and pick marks that show up under direct lighting. All hardware looks immaculate showing no wear. There is one dent in the bottom edge of the guitar. The glossy black back shows scratches and worming typical with a glossy black finish. The back of the satin neck is smooth and clean with no imperfections. The maple fingerboard looks great. There is only a tiny bit of fretwear, mostly on the 2nd fret, and the action is spot on and setup with no buzzing anywhere. The headstock looks great with one ding on the top edge. All tuners work perfectly. The truss rod has been test and functions. All electronics work great and sound fantastic. It will ship in a non-functioning hardshell case for safety. No other accessories are included. The Axis Super Sport has all the great features of the Axis guitar with a few upgraded options for ultimate versatility. Beautiful quilt or flame maple veneer over basswood with custom DiMarzio electronics are controlled by a five-way lever switch offering split coil tonal combinations unavailable on the Axis. The Axis Super Sport asymmetric hard rock maple neck allows for comfortable hand and finger positions across all 22 frets, while the Music Man vintage-style hardtail bridge and locking Schaller tuners makes string changing quick and easy keeping the guitar perfectly in tune.
