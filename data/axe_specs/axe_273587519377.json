{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Back Story:I bought this beautiful guitar about 15 years ago from a former Gibson rep. Here's his story on this guitar. According to him, Gibson requisitioned several different models of Epiphone to be made by the Aria Company in Japan (Aria & Company, Inc. Nagoya, Japan) as samples for a possible production run. This one was the only one delivered as an acoustic archtop with a carved spruce top, and he was able to \"acquire\" it. He claimed to have delivery receipts from Aria, but did not deliver them with the guitar and, since he's no longer around, it's just his story. My Story:I needed a guitar to play with a big band playing swing concerts and college events. I made several modifications to make it more authentic to the era. It came with a nice reproduction \"Gibson Style\" L-5 tailpiece (which I removed but still have). I purchase and installed an authentic 1950's antique gold Epiphone \"Frequensator\" tailpiece from Archtop Guitar Inc. From my personal collection I added a vintage DeArmond 1100 pickup and authentic Epiphone \"crown\" tuner buttons. It came with an Epiphone \"E\" pickguard, but I installed one that I purchased from Retroguitarparts that once belonged to Duke Robillard (yes, the very talented blues master), and was already designed to fit the DeArmond. The overall effect was exactly what I wanted and I played it exclusively for 5 or 6 years until that big band disbanded. The Details:At 3 1/2 inches at the rim, this guitar is slightly thicker, and slightly more rounded (thru the bouts) than an L-5. It is very comfortable to hold. The neck has about the same dimensions as a 50's-60's Les Paul (not small or thin, but not real fat either). It has the standard Gibson nut width (1-11/16) and standard 25-1/2 inch scale length. Depending on the strings used, it has a loud, woody acoustic sound. With the DeArmond if has that distinctive 50's jazz tone. Materials: Top: \"close grained\" hand carved (graduated) spruce.Back and sides:Laminated maple.Neck: 5-piece maple with mahogany accent strips. Neck Features: Width: 1.70 (1-11/16) inches at the nut, 2.10 at 12th fret. String Spread: approx 1.43 inches at nut, 2.0 at the bridge.Scale: 25.5 inches.Radius: 10-12 inchesShape: \"C\" profile (about the same as a 50's-60's Les Paul).Fret Markers: Traditional Epiphone Abalone/Mother-of-pearl block inlays.Tuners: Grover \"Roto-matic\" machines with traditional Epiphone \"crown\" tuner buttons.Edge binding: White-black-white binding.Head stock Detail; Traditional Epiphone shape with Abalone \"Flower of Life\" inlay. Body:Shape: 16-5/8 inch lower bout, 12 1/2 inch upper bout with Venetian cut-out.Thickness: Full 3-1/2 inches at the rim, approx 4 inches at the center.Edge binding: 6 layer white-black-white binding Other: Case: Beautiful new brown hard shell \"Mastercrafted\" re-issue case w/ embossed \"E\" inside (see photo). The \"fine print\" Payment: I'll only accept PayPal payments and payment is expected at the conclusion of the sale. Returns: I'm a player not a collector or a dealer, so I'm not in a position to offer \"returns\", except where I have intentionally misrepresented this guitar. I've done my best to describe and photograph this beautiful instrument so please review all the photographs and descriptions carefully, and contact me (thru eBay) with any questions.. Packaging and Shipping: I'll ship within 2 working days from PayPal's notice that the funds have been transferred. I've had some bad experiences so I'm only selling and shipping within the continental United States.I'll only ship by insured UPS (or FedEx) and only to a confirmed PayPal shipping address. Insured shipping will cost around $150.00 so I'll split the shipping cost and ship anywhere in the continental U.S, for a flat $75.00 to the buyer. If other shipping arrangements are required please contact me with the details. I'll package the guitar and case carefully. I'll also down-tune the strings, remove the bridge to protect the top from being crushed (it will be in the case pocket), and wrap the strings protect the frets \"grooving\" due to string rattle in route. I've been a player for more than 50 years and have accumulated 21 guitars and as I get older I prefer wider necks and thinner bodies, so it's time to start selling most of my collection and other equipment.
