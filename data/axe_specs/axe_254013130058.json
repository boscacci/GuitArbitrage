{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1989 Ibanez RG550 Desert Sun Yellow Vintage 80's alert! Bust out your spandex and borrow your wife's eyeliner because this guitar will take you back in time. All orignal, comes with a gig bag Copper shielded cavities with brand new wiring, pots and caps. So quiet!!! Pro fret polish and setup I can't tell you much about the history. I purchased it as a box of parts (trem, neck and body) and had it professionally put together and set up. Plays ninja fast, super close action. What I can say is that it was lefty owned because all the chips are in the opposite place you'd expect so when playing it right its all at the top and covered my your arm. USA only please PayPal Shipping is $55 it's flat rate because the box itself is $18 and the guitar is shipped fully insured for its sale value. I pride myself in my packing and you can rest assure that your guitar will arrive in perfect condition. But piece of mind cost extra in materials and when spending that much. Why skimp in the shipping? Feel free to ask questions, lots of pics available", "ItemID": "254013130058", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T17:32:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T14:10:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1989-Ibanez-RG550-/254013130058", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Rhododendron, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540131300588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/jN8AAOSwEJ1cB9B~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/Zh8AAOSwUMBcB9C6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/gz8AAOSw1qhcB9DY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/VcwAAOSw1tJcB9Fi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/AfoAAOSwlx9cB9GL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/P8IAAOSw8BdcB9Go/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/FisAAOSwy3JcB9HA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/skMAAOSw2fRcB9Ru/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/6FcAAOSwwtdcB9XY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/V5oAAOSwUnFcB9a7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/mpkAAOSw-ghcB9bW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDE0NDA=/z/IXIAAOSw19dcB9cI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "97049", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mthoodguitarandcustomshop", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 100, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 570.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 570.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 313}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1989 Ibanez RG550", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RG550"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ibanez RG"]}]}, "HitCount": 633, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Vintage 1989 in good condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
