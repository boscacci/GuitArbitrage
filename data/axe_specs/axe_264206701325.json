{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Available is a fantastic American-made Fender Stratocaster (circa 2005) in an Ice Blue finish (looks like LPB Blue, too) [a refinish from Candy Apple Red] on a '57 American Vintage alder-wood body mated to a '70s American Vintage rosewood-fretboard neck. The hardware is all original except for the pickguard (red tortoise shell.), pickups (hot imports), tuning machines (vintage ones stamped 'Made in W. Germany), and the neck plate (custom order - 1960s serial #). The body and neck have been relic'd/aged to perfection; Not overdone either. The look-and-feel of this guitar is similar to its ultra-expensive siblings (the Custom Shop) without the hefty price tag. One of the best playing-and-sounding ones that I've ever had... and I've had many. The body resonates nicely, and the sound of it acoustically is wonderful. She rings smoothly; so well-balanced between the lows and highs. While some guitars have a deep bottom (or \"dull-sounding\" bottom) and some others sound too \"tinny\", this one is just right. The body was routed for the Clapton-active-setup many years ago. That was before the refinish, and at the time, the cavities had been sprayed with conductive-shield paint for noise reduction. Even with the current pickups installed, it's pretty good about the 60-cycle hum. No pops or static sounds either. This Stratocaster weighs in at only 7.8 pounds, too. The action is set low to my liking without any fret buzz or dead spots, etc. It \"plays like butter\" as they say. There is some light fret-wear closer to the headstock, but there's still plenty of life left in 'em. The grain on the rosewood fretboard is nice-and-straight with a medium darkness to it. There's also a hint of flame on one small area on the back of the neck along with a few tiny \"birdseye\" spots surrounding it. This is a quality-wood guitar for sure. No obtrusive bumps or dings on the back of the neck either. It's silky smooth. No case or gig bag is included, but the guitar will be well-packed for shipment. FREE SHIPPING!
