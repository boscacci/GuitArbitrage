{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a highly modified 2017 Gibson Les Paul M2 Electric Guitar with Gibson gig bag. The bridge, pickups, electronics and tuners have been upgraded. This is no bottom feeder guitar! The pickups are Seymour Duncan Hot Rodded set (SH-4 JB in bridge, and SH-2 Jazz in neck - Made in the US). All of the electronics were replaced with upgraded pots, capacitors, jack, switch, and wiring. The tuners were replaced with Grover Rotomatics and the bridge is a Gotoh 510UB. All work was completed by a professional luthier. The guitar plays fantastic and is in excellent condition. Comes in a Gibson gig bag. Mr. Yuk is a decal and can be removed. Think he kind of looks good with the citron green body! Asking price is basically the cost of the upgrades and a few dollars more for the guitar! Photos are of actual guitar and gig bag. Auction is for guitar and gig bag only. Guitar is being sold outside of eBay; therefore, I reserve the right to end the auction early. Guitar is being sold as-is and returns are not accepted. Payment is due within 3 business days or I reserve the right to re-list the guitar. I will only ship to the CONTINENTAL US. Shipping will be flat $50 for insured standard ground.
