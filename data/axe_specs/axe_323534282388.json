{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello everyone! I am selling my Gibson SG electric guitar. this is a great instrument for performers and players alike! The one important detail to now is that this guitar will need a proper setup from guitar center or a guitar technician for adjustments, as it does have a couple frets that have a \"buzz\" to them, which I know is an easy fix, just one I am not sure how to go about. There are scratches present on the neck and body from use, but this particular model of guitar had a finish that is intended to replicate that vintage/relic look! Making for one beautiful and unique instrument! I have lowered the price significantly due to the need of a setup, but the guitar has been tested and all the electronics are in working order.
