{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx, no post office boxes.I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Strat\". The Squier maple neck has zero fret wear,and has had a nice headstock make over with many coats of cleat over the decal. I upgraded the closed back tuners with some nice vintage looking Kluson styyle tuners. The very cool Gloss Seafoam Green Body looks very nice, only the mildest of surface scratches. The pickups have been upgraded with some nice hot ceramic single coils,8k-neck,9k-middle,10k-bridge ,and the guitar has been wired for tone control on all three pickups.The bridge and neck pickups both work with the neck pickups tone control. Nice to have tone control on the bridge pickup,makes it a lot more versatile. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The capacitor has been upgraded with a .033uf axial capacitor . More range of tone control and a smoother response. I added the brown tortoise pickguard,rear tremolo cover,cream pickup covers,switch tip and whammy bar tip to get the vibe I was going for. This guitar sounds really good,and it looks super cool. Plays smooth with low action,sounds great, and looks very cool. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities. I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw. I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings. All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented.
