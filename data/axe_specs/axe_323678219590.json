{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I bought this new and had it aged for true vintage looks. I am getting ready to take some new photos, there was a Tripleplay midi pickup installed there and there is a small groove in the wood there. It has been lacquer sealed. This is the best Gibson Custom Shop guitar I have ever played. The only guitar that was better was a John Cruz Fender Stat. The neck has also been lightly sanded to give it a real wood feel and then Tung Oiled. After five decades of playing I am now just playing acoustic. This has been the best guitar and sound I have ever owned. If tone and play-ability are more important than looks when this is your guitar. You will not find one better, I can guarantee it. Thanks for asking, Jeff I played a '54 Goldtop and a '56 Goldtop when I found this at a guitar store in 2010. Still in the original box. This guitar played and sound better than both of my other P-90 Goldtops that I purchased it immediately. Since the top does not have any bridge or tailpiece drilled into the top it sustains forever. Gibson DescriptionThe Les Paul Tribute 1952 honors the most important figure in all of guitar history and the guitar he designed and loved. Les Paul. With a golden mahogany body, maple top and rosewood fingerboard, the Les Paul Tribute 1952 is equipped with a bridge that\u2019s an exact replica of Les\u2019 original 1952 patent. Gibson\u2019s luthiers have also added historical interest with details like stamping \u201cprototype\u201d into the back of the peg head and staying true to Les\u2019 preference for P-90 pickups. The original Gibson hardshell case, COA and case candy is included. Lollar P-90 Soapbar Pickups Installed(Original Gibson P-90\u2019s included) Lollar\u2019s flagship pickup and an industry standard. This pickup is scatter wound with de-gaussed Alnico 5 bar magnets, giving you a fat, clean tone with a smoother treble making it ideal for harder, driving rock with more grind. It sounds like an old P-90 rather than a new pickup with hard edges. The neck and bridge volumes are nearly equal when playing chords, with the bridge sounding slightly hotter when playing single notes. Pickups can be purchased separately or in matched two or three piece sets. RWRP sets for hum-canceling operation with single conductor and braided shield lead wire.
