Neck: Maple neck with \u201csoft V\u201d profile, Bi-Flex\u2122 truss rod and Micro-Tilt\u2122 Compound-radius maple fingerboard (9.5\u201d-14\u201d) with 22 medium jumbo frets Designed for remarkable comfort and performance, with an attractively tinted satin finish and a \u201cV\u201d-shaped profile (the shape of the neck in cross section) ideal for players with large hands whose thumb extends well over the side of the fingerboard. Black abalone dot inlays. Pickups: TV Jones Classic Filter'Tron Pickup Set, ChromeFilter\u2019Tron style pickup is a humbucker with a unique design with specific characteristics. Its dual-coil pickup design cancels the hum, and with a large 1/4\u2033 alnico magnet (twice as large as a \u201cstandard\u201d PAF magnet) and larger pole screws, the result is a higher inductance (more power \u2013 thicker tone). The Filter\u2019Tron\u2019s bobbins are positioned closer together and wound with less magnet wire for less loss of high end - With a Coil Tap! A TV Jones Filter\u2019Tron pickup blends ALL of these traditional characteristics with select, specific top-quality USA-made components. This special recipe gives way to an un-parallelled tone, unique to TV Jones guitar pickups. This is an awesome looking and sounding Stratocaster - and its one of a kind! Don't let this one get away. Comes with a new locking fender case.
