{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2009 G&L ASAT Classic S Serial number CLF56535 Weight is approximately 9 lbs. The maple neck is dated 11/17/09.The swamp ash body is dated 11/20/09. The beautiful gloss maple neck, maple fret board and frets are in excellent condition, free from scratches and dents. I measured the nut width as approximately 1 5/8 inch, the neck thickness at the first fret as approximately 0.855 inch and at the twelfth fret as approximately 0.982 inch. The beautiful body is in excellent shape, too. I just noticed that it looks like the body was scratched during manufacturing in 2009, below the volume and tone controls, prior to painting with a tinted gloss clear coating (I tried to capture this in one of the photos). This is not a scratch in the tinted gloss clear coating, it's beneath the coating - you can't feel it. The prior owner provided me with a second set of strap pins and screws, these are included, along with a certificate of authenticity. The neck and bridge pickups are ASAT Classic MFDs and the bridge pickup is a S-500 MFD. There's a five position pickup selector and a push-pull volume knob that enables selection of just the neck and bridge pickups simultaneously or all three pickups simultaneously. The original G&G hard shell case is in excellent condition with a few minor exterior scuffs. This guitar ships domestically, internationally or it can be picked up locally.", "ItemID": "323556902243", "EndTime": "2018-11-29T03:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T03:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2009-G-L-ASAT-Classic-S-USA-gloss-ash-body-maple-neck-original-hard-shell-case-/323556902243", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Atlanta, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235569022438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1N1gxNjAw/z/L8cAAOSw29Jb8YKs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTU4WDE2MDA=/z/QgcAAOSwhfRb8YLm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQwWDE2MDA=/z/hR4AAOSwoZlb8YLb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTI1WDE2MDA=/z/jDgAAOSwkvtb8YLe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTE5WDE2MDA=/z/6FsAAOSwtmNb8YTJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjA0WDE2MDA=/z/0LoAAOSwr-Bb8YTQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzkzWDE2MDA=/z/CgQAAOSwwtdb8YLz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzNFgxNjAw/z/CzAAAOSw5atb8YLO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk5WDE2MDA=/z/CqkAAOSwwtdb8YNL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ5NVgxNjAw/z/XFEAAOSwVcZb8YYM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5OVgxNjAw/z/L7oAAOSwTc5b8ZFl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30329", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stillpractising", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 71, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 122}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2009 G&L ASAT Classic S USA gloss ash body, maple neck, original hard shell case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ASAT Classic S"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 485, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
