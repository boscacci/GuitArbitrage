{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "NO RESERVE AUCTION!!! FOR INSANELY TOP NOTCH AND SPECCED OUT USA LES PAUL! 2008 GIBSON LES PAUL LIMITED EDITION EBONY GLOSS WITH GOLD HARDWARE Just in Time for Christmas and will be delivered in time to give as a gift!!! This guitar is ready to play straight out of the case, amazing guitar that feels fantastic under the fingers. Guitar has circular very shallow buffing scratches from cleaning the guitar over time, I took a picture to illustrate. They would all disappear if you got some buffer and applied a coat properly and wiped it off. Would be back to 100%. Small tiny dongs here and there, no major scratches or major dents, no cracking, no warping, nothing. Pro Serviced 2 weeks ago, plays absolutely fantastic and sounds VERY very good. These pickups are so good I considered removing them before selling it. I can't find any other pickups with this particular sound that I want, they are fantastic. PRO SERVICED 2 WEEKS AGO \u25aa Fret Ends sanded \u25aa Frets Polished (have since been played on but still nice and smooth with no catching) \u25aa Fretboard Smoothed and Conditioned with TOP quality conditioner \u25aa ALL hardware inspected and tighted/adjusted to top specifications. \u25aa Action adjusted to my personal playing preferance for a less paul, which is perfectly in between a slammed (low as possible) action and a slightly higher action. Les Pauls are all about the TONE! So a slightly higher action (not high lol just not slammed) gives you a MUCH MUCH MUCH better tone, especially for recording. This allows the strings to freely vibrate longer and harder and allows you to really DIG IN with your pick to get those increidble tones and not have to worry about buzzing. \u25aa Individual string height adjusted at the bridge/saddle to accomadate my preferance as well. (Perfect for true aggressive playing or filthy dirty blues where you really dig in \u25aa solder ends checked and approved \u25aa Etc, Etc, Etc. \u25a0 2008 USA MADE Gibson Les Paul Studio \u25a0 \u25cf Comes with Custom USA MADE Gibson Les Paul Ultra-Form Fitted and Super Padded Case.
