{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2011 Gibson LG-2 Banner Reissue. Condition is Used. This guitar is a reissue of the banner LG2 of the 1940s. Those old banner guitars had no serial numbers. This guitar recreates that by actually placing the serial number inside the body of the guitar, like a Martin. The bridge is a thinner banner bridge, like the orginals, not the bigger belly bridge. The guitar is in very good shape but it\u2019s been played so expect normal pick wear or a scratch here and there that can only be seen in certain lighting. Also, my tech told me that the guitar could have originally have had a pickup from the factory in it, but it may have been removed. He really couldn\u2019t say for sure. There is obviously currently no pickup system in this guitar. The guitar was just setup with low action, it plays great, no buzzes, no issues, and it comes with the original case.\u2028 \u2028 The Guitar is very lightweight, and the neck feels like a basic Gibson acoustic neck you would find these days, c shape and fairly slim and comfortable. Not a baseball bat. I only ship to the lower 48 states.", "ItemID": "163567654444", "EndTime": "2019-03-02T02:00:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-27T02:00:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2011-Gibson-LG-2-Banner-Reissue-Acoustic-Guitar-/163567654444", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Yonkers, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635676544448080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1Mlg3ODE=/z/sjwAAOSwFlJcUmum/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ3NVg3NjM=/z/mVEAAOSwxrJcUm4t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qKYAAOSwPVFcUmuM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p6MAAOSw5EpcUmt~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0NFgxMTk3/z/YtcAAOSwiKdcUm5H/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HPAAAOSwg5FcUmuJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3N1gxMDkz/z/Z9YAAOSwSk9ccKB~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MHoAAOSwtLxccKDZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9L4AAOSwgX9ccKDb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LFUAAOSwLXFccKGH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PyEAAOSwxXJccKGJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6i0AAOSw6aVccOav/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "10704", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "elston99", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1709, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 148}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2011 Gibson LG-2 Banner Reissue Acoustic Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["LG-2"]}]}, "HitCount": 146, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
