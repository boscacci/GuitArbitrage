{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for your consideration is a 2007 Gibson Les Paul Studio Premium Plus with an AAA grade flame. Includes OHSC, perfect condition. The guitar is in mint condition, it has never left the house. I would say collector's grade. The gold plating on the pickups shows just a tinge of fade, but might be able to be cleaned up. I don\u2019t want to put any chemicals on the instrument. I just don\u2019t play this one any more, and someone else should enjoy it. Recently set up, the guitar plays like butter. I have too much equipment, and a daughter going to college soon. I also will be posting more amps and guitars, please check my other auctions. Everything listed will already be priced to sell. All sales are final, no returns. Everything is described and photographed accurately as it leaves my house.I have sold many guitars and related equipment on Ebay over the years, you can bid in confidence. Shipping is for USA only. If you are local, pick up can be arranged. Feel free to ask any questions. Thank you.", "ItemID": "332882640808", "EndTime": "2018-11-15T23:43:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T21:09:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Premium-Plus-AAA-Flame-OHSC-/332882640808", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Grand Island, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328826408088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/Xg8AAOSwIw1bx6J6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/nlwAAOSwhnhbx6LC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/P50AAOSw9sNbx6LR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/WkkAAOSwYBtbx6Kd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/YXQAAOSwBRVbx6Kd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/t4IAAOSw5atbx6Kc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/W68AAOSwhyRbx6Ke/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/mF0AAOSw0Rlbx6Ki/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/rtsAAOSwqqJbx6Kg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/3D8AAOSw~Qhbx6Kg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/YL0AAOSwahlbx6Kg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/GfAAAOSwnVRbx6Kg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "14072", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wakuhn1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 893, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.8}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 48}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Gibson Les Paul Studio Premium Plus AAA Flame with OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio Plus"]}]}, "HitCount": 52, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1224.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
