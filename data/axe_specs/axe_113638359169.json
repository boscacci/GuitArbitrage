{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Squire J. Mascis Jazzmaster with padded gig bag. These have been getting very nice reviews since they were introduced and this one is in like new shape. Only issue I've found with it is the top slider button (by the top horn) was sticking a little last time I picked it up, but it would work if you twiddled with it a bit. Probably could be cured with a bit of contact spray. Not a mark on it. Save yourself some money over a new one and this is about as close as you'll get. The tremolo arm is included, but wasn't on it when I took pics. Guitar stand in the pictures not included in this sale. Although I'm not really a player, I do own several guitars and this one is surprisingly easy for me to play. I can see why people like the scale length on these so well. Ships in a nice padded canvas gig bag to lower 48 USA buyers only. All sales are final unless it's been blatantly misrepresented.", "ItemID": "113638359169", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T18:53:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-13T18:53:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squire-J-Mascis-Jazzmaster-padded-gig-bag-/113638359169", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Monmouth, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136383591698080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTg=/z/40IAAOSwJihcZGQS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDc2/z/OQkAAOSwN3lcZGQW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/7sUAAOSw3eRcZGQS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODg=/z/cDsAAOSwceZcZGQW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NjU=/z/6IQAAOSwFalcZGQV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTIz/z/rjQAAOSwQ7lcZGQf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTQyWDE2MDA=/z/p3EAAOSwgPVcZGQU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MzI=/z/F3kAAOSw0q1cZGQe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTgxWDE2MDA=/z/LywAAOSwHkBcZGQc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/xykAAOSwrndcZGQe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "61462", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "buzzkill4u2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 631, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 281.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 281.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 109}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squire J.
