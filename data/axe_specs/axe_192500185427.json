{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello ! Up for sale is a really nice American Stratocaster by none other than musical giant, Fender ! From the serial # lookup online, it appears that this Strat was built in 2005. As with any Stratocaster that is made in the USA, this guitar plays well acoustically and sounds great plugged in through your favorite amp or amps ! I am not the original owner of this guitar, so I am not 100% sure about what's original. But I do know that the tuners have been upgraded to unbranded locking tuners that look just like locking tuners that are always put on the higher end Stratocasters. The nut has been upgraded to what looks like a synthetic material like bone...definitely more sturdy than your run of the mill stock nut. The saddles on the bridge appear to match the nut, so perhaps they are made of bone as well? And finally, the pickguard appears to have been put on after market to kind of complete the gold and cream theme that the original owner was going for ! I think overall, it IS a very handsome guitar ! Stratocasters are such great guitars because not only do they sound great, but imho, they are also very versatile. You can play funk, country, rock, hard rock, worship music, texas blues, other blues and even some forms of metal ! (Just ask the maestro Yngwie Malmsteen !) This guitar listing also comes with a nice Fender gig Bag to protect your investment. Both during shipping and when you own this wonderful axe ! Oh, and here is a demo video I made with this guitar into a Boss ME-25 multi-effects and a Gibson Skylark GA-5, bost for sale here on ebay:https://www.facebook.com/joseph.cabatit/videos/10212344271625486/ Snag it now before someone else does! Please read the condition description, these listing details, and examine the pictures carefully. Thanks so much for your interest and I hope you buy it now!!!!!", "ItemID": "192500185427", "EndTime": "2018-12-26T22:24:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-04-02T21:17:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2005-Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Red-upgraded-saddles-nut-tuners-/192500185427", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Mill, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1925001854278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU2N1g2NDA=/z/IaQAAOSwjX1awpxp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3ODE=/z/Ma8AAOSwT2NawpyG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ5Mlg4ODY=/z/WO4AAOSwbzxawpyg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2Mjc=/z/buEAAOSw1URawpy-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3NTk=/z/jo8AAOSwgKBawp0M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM2NVg4ODY=/z/Gn4AAOSwyO1awp0f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/QZwAAOSwWCBawpgc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg4WDE0NDM=/z/s9MAAOSw-btawp1J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3MVg3ODU=/z/TSwAAOSwcjhawp1m/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzgxWDE1ODc=/z/zxwAAOSwWUlawp17/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTA2WDE1ODc=/z/DUwAAOSwfqFawp2P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg4MDc=/z/6~MAAOSw2cVawp2q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29707", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "heavyspender", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3195, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "Asia", "AU", "NZ", "EG", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2005 Fender American Standard Stratocaster Red with upgraded saddles/nut/tuners.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Listing", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 2202, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=11349994", "StoreName": "Heavyspender&#39;s Hot Hiddentreasures"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["TR"], "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "In very good shape.
