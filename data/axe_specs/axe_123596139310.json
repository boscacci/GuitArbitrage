I have listed this guitar as used, but there is only about 2 hours of play on it. when I got I played it, for about 20 min. Order new strings, so on the guitar right now are Super Slinky RPS 11's on low E, A and D, and 10's on high E, B and G. played it a few more times only in the house, and put it away.
