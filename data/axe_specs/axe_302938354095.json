{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Lightly used, in great condition. 2016 model. It comes with the hard-shell case, which is normally $150. If there are any scratches, it would take careful inspection to find them, as it\u2019s been very well taken care of and, again, not used much at all. I\u2019m selling because I have an abundance of guitars I don\u2019t need and I\u2019m moving soon. They\u2019ve gotta go! This is a right handed guitar. For whatever reason, it\u2019s listed as left handed. It is not left handed. It is right handed. It\u2019s very playable. It has a great feeling to it, and sound-wise, you know what you\u2019re going to get with the EMG pickups. It\u2019s also gorgeous and sports an amazing finish. Normally about an $800-$900 guitar new. With the case that\u2019s around $900-$1000. So this is starting off as a great deal. Just restrung it. The action is currently average to low. Will be packaged and shipped via UPS.
