{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a used Jackson Dinky Reverse transparent green electric guitar. This guitar features EMG-HZ pickups, three knobs, one switch, a reverse headstock, and Floyd Rose tremolo system (no tremolo whammy arm included). This guitar is in good condition. It has been tested an works as it should. It comes with a Jackson brand hard locking case, with keys, and the original owner's manual. There are nicks to the green paint on the outer rim of the guitar in a few spots. I have done my best to capture these spots, so please view all pictures carefully! PLEASE READ THESE 15 THINGS BEFORE BIDDING: Make sure to read every listing completely and carefully and look at all photos before bidding. This store sells mainly used items and we describe any damage in the listing (condition description/details). Minor cosmetic blemishes and signs of use might not be mentioned, so PLEASE ASK if you're concerned about such things and can't tell by looking at the pictures what to expect. If the item is perfect or almost perfect (near new), the listing will let you know, otherwise please assume it has some signs of use if it is listed as used. This store uses UPS and USPS shipping.
