{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Lightly used PSR single cut, no issues, works beautifully, comes with padded PRS gig bag, I ship promptly with real guitar boxes, packed well and insured. Other: Classic style, versatile tone and effortless playability. With an understated, refined appearance, instant comfort and playability, and a voice that is familiar and captivating, the vintage-inspired S2 Singlecut is a guitar you won\u2019t want to put down. Its all-mahogany body and asymmetrical, beveled top give the S2 Singlecut much of its explosive tone. While not a super high output guitar, the S2 Singlecut can be overdriven into well-rounded, organic rock tones without sacrificing the punch or clarity found in higher-output guitars (or even active pickups). The bridge pickup is rich with some sparkle and substantial but tight low end, while the neck pickup is a little darker providing great balance and vintage tones. Includes gig bag.
