{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "If you have ever held and played a historic Les Paul you'll understand what makes this Les Paul an absolute masterpiece. This guitar was made in the USA in Gibsons factory like the rest of their guitars but this one is part of a batch that was built with the intention to be exported to the Japanese market who have higher standards in build and quality, in result Gibson really pays attention to every little detail with these appointed instruments as clients are demanding in that market especially because they pay a bigger premium to have it exported. Gibson goes all out on quality control as if they're building the guitar for slash and it shows. This guitar has a \"handmade boutique feel\" to it when playing - similar to the historic models. If you want to understand an example of the value and quality step up for the Japan market look at the Gibson Les Paul \"Yamano\" 59 Reissue. Those guitars are renown worldwide to be the best Les Paul Gibson has produced. When you hold this Cherry Sunburst work of art it really stands out above the rest. This guitar has the cream of the crop as far as tonewoods are concerned. The guitar is non weight relieved or chambered rather its a solid body like the classic Les Paul's from the 50s. The guitar resonates and rings so beautifully. Just look at the flame top on this one its absolutely stunning and has that real holy grail 50s \"burst\" vibe to it!! The pickups in this model are bar-none the BEST pickups Gibson has made in the decade- the \"59 Tributes\" they are the holy grail in tone!! This guitar is a purists dream as it has the best features that Gibson is re known for. The guitar is in great condition has small signs of use, some natural old school binding bleed and little to no fretwear. Guitar will come with the timeless and beautiful brown on red original hardshell case, all paperwork and case candy. Even if you have an R9 or R8 already this beauty is a staple and collectors piece. Honestly for this money nothing comes remotely near it in tone, feel, playability, looks and build quality. This guitar can justify a price tag of $4K+ EASILY maybe even more by todays standards. The winner of this work of art will be blown away when they plug this beauty in", "ItemID": "113516953675", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T01:51:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T01:51:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/GIBSON-BEST-EXAMPLE-LES-PAUL-TRADITIONAL-JAPAN-CLIENT-CHERRY-FLAME-YAMANO-1959T-/113516953675", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Long Branch, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135169536758080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI3MlgxNjAw/z/DwgAAOSw651cLWp7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/h34AAOSwvytcLWqH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5J4AAOSwKOZcLWqB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eScAAOSw1jpcLWqK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rBoAAOSwVMJcLWqQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/UzAAAOSwx9lcLWqN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2FoAAOSwwSJcLWqF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzEy/z/ue8AAOSw4sNcLWp3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LQMAAOSwN11cLWqO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/T3MAAOSw~slcLWqJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07740", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eddiea3", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 873, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 23, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CO", "PA", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "GIBSON BEST EXAMPLE!
