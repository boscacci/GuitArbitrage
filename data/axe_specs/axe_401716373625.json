{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender J5 Artist Series Telecaster John 5 MIM Tele Black Chrome 12 String HS. Condition is Used. Awesome guitar. Lets get that right out of the way. Screaming pickups. This is the first run Artist Series with the single pickup and a single humbucker (which I much prefer to the triple humbucker!!!) The 12 string headstock really sets it apart too! This is an all around rocker, and very rare! Sustain for days (exaggeration) and style to match. The chrome pick guard has some pick wear (no surprises there) and guitar is in fantastic condition otherwise. Holds tune well. No scratchy pots. Cool headstock bolt plate too, lots of little details about this guitar I like. Between a wrist surgery that severely inhibits my ability to play and a move to another state and me wanting to carry as little with me as possible I am letting it go. It will ship fully insured in a double gig bag and boxed well. Shipping is expensive, it sucks, you have to wait for your item... But its just the way it goes. I don't make a penny off shipping and often lose money. Please ask any questions before bidding/buying. Thanks for looking and keep on jammin'.", "ItemID": "401716373625", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T07:03:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-25T23:30:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-J5-Artist-Series-Telecaster-John-5-MIM-Tele-Black-Chrome-12-String-HS-/401716373625", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Merritt Island, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "PictureURL": [], "PostalCode": "32953", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aboveandbeyondfinishes_4", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 875.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 875.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 518}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender J5 Artist Series Telecaster John 5 MIM Tele Black Chrome 12 String HS", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 18, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
