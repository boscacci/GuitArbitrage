{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A 2013 mini humbucker goldtop Les Paul with minor cosmetic wear. Comes with strap locks, and a Gibson hard shell case. Buyer pays shipping. No international buyers please. Here is how this guitar is described. Redesigned Mini Humbucking pickupsWhen Gibson reinvented their Mini Humbuckers, they gave guitars like the Les Paul Studio '70s Tribute a wider and more expressive range of tone. Dual steel blades and single Alnico V magnets provide you with more output then Gibson's previous Mini Humbucker design, and yet they still give the Les Paul Studio the vintage chime and open sound you want. And thanks to their calibrated windings, you'll be blown away by how well the Mini Humbucker bridge and neck pickups complement one another.SlimTaper neck for fast and smooth playabilityThe Gibson Les Paul Studio '70s Tribute sports a comfortable, fast-action neck with a '60s SlimTaper profile, popular in the '70s as an alternative to fatter necks. Early Gibson guitars had huge, often ungainly necks. By 1960, Gibson had gradually carved down this profile into what became their SlimTaper neck. As your fingers move down this neck, the precisely controlled width-to-thickness ratio of the Les Paul Studio '70s Tribute's SlimTaper neck provides you with a consistent, fast, and comfortable feel. It's no wonder many world-class guitar players consider the SlimTaper Gibson's finest neck.A true American-made Gibson guitarThe bottom line about this Les Paul Studio '70s Tribute is that it's a real Gibson solidbody electric guitar. Ask anyone, and they'll tell you that the Gibson name still stands for something. American made and built to the standards Gibson has held to - despite rising manufacturing costs - you can feel proud when you pick up your Les Paul Studio '70s Tribute.Gibson Les Paul Studio '70s Tribute Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:Classic Les Paul playability and tone with a '70s vibeColor: Gold Top Dark BackMahogany body with maple top provides iconic Les Paul richness and sustainDual Mini Humbucker pickups have a wider frequency range and hotter output than previous generationsSlimTaper neck feels fast and smoothBuilt in the USA", "ItemID": "303068534111", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T21:26:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-19T21:26:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-1970s-Tribute-/303068534111", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030685341118080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GzEAAOSw0qdcbD8M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Qe8AAOSw~KpcbD84/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BxgAAOSws7FcbD59/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AbQAAOSwwnVcbD6D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ooMAAOSwrn9cbD6L/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rkEAAOSwpsBcbD6S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QVMAAOSw~KpcbD7q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IN8AAOSwl7pcbD6f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "45209", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bluesdoc1952", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 220, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 840.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 840.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 240}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul 1970s Tribute", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid body"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Gold Top"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 784, "Subtitle": "2013 Goldtop", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "minor scratches and scuffs", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
