{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Squier Stagemaster by Fender V4 Guitar. It was manufactured in Korea in 2000 as part of Fender/Squier's decision to upgrage Squier's image, but at a lower cost than their US or MIM guitars. This particular model is Version 4 (V4), the most unusual and most factory-customized of all the Stagemaster models, as it is the Deluxe version with neck-through (as opposed to bolt-on or set-neck) construction, shaped with an exceptionally comfortable contoured heel and a humbucker-single coil-humbucker (HSH) pickup configuration. The V4 Stagemaster uses the familiar Strat-type five-position pickup selector, wired to provide a full bridge or neck humbucker in positions 1 and 5, respectively, the center single-coil alone in position 3 and a single coil from either the bridge or neck along with the center single-coil in positions 2 and 4, respectively. This Deluxe HSH Stagemaster is finished Pewter Gray Metallic with black hardware. Also, this model is factory-equipped Licensed Floyd Rose bridge and a 12-inch radius rosewood fingerboard with 24 frets for a full two-octave range. I have read that is model has an alder body and maple neck, but it's painted and I can't confirm this. It's condition is good with one small dent near the rear strap button. I tired to photograph this imperfection, but it did not show well in the final picture. The guitar is original as far as I can tell and I have included several pictures in an attempt to show the guitar as best I could, but with its dusky gray, sparkly color and black hardware, it might not look as good in pictures as it does in person. Its best features to me are the sonic range and the ultra-comfortable feel along the heel joint, as it can be this way because of the through-neck construction. The pickups are on the hotter side and use 500k volume and tone pots, so definitely cut the gain on your Marshall! Its worst feature to me is the Floyd Rose, mainly because I can play, but not adjust! The Floyd Rose is an acclaimed bridge and one that is really superior if set up properly and if you like to dive-bomb the whammy, but one that is just a little too much for my style. If you know what you're doing with a Floyd, you'll be fine. I've had this guitar a while, but don't use it so much anymore...not because of the Floyd, but because I'm more comfortable with a 24-inch scale length and a .010 or .011 string set, rather than the .009s I would recommend for this 25.5-inch scale length instrument. Use D'Addario 9-42 nickel wounds on the Stagemaster. Trust me on this. Anyway, that's probably enough...just email with any questions you have. I didn't pay a mint for the Stagemaster, largely because it's a \"Squire by Fender,\" as opposed to a \"Fender\" per se. Shipping these days is growing by leaps and bounds, as you know if you've shipped anything lately of any size, but I rarely use anything other than free shipping on eBay, so I'll start the bidding at $50, just to cover shipping costs. There is no case or gig bag, but I have shipped tons of stuff over the years with no problem. And hey--thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "202541223979", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T05:22:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T05:22:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squier-Stagemaster-Fender-V4-HSH-Guitar-/202541223979", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025412239798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NTc=/z/DhEAAOSwV3dcGIJn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XWwAAOSwjkZcGIJp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xHgAAOSw3BJcGIJt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ongAAOSwZBRcGIJw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F2gAAOSwHexcGIJz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/66IAAOSwIkNcGIJ2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R7UAAOSweiFcGIJ5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SjQAAOSwIKNcGIJ8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gYgAAOSwDX5cGIJ-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MDk=/z/PIkAAOSw29JcGIKA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ILoAAOSwoZJcGIKD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DowAAOSwQZdcGIKG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27401", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "daphniedoo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 838, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 50, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 271.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 271.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 79}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squier Stagemaster by Fender V4 HSH Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stagemaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Dark Pewter Gray"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}]}, "HitCount": 233, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 276.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
