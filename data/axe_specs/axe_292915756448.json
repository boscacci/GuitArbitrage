{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here's a beautiful and formidable Gibson Firebird Five Reissue from 1994, Gibson's 100th Anniversary. They stepped up the quality that year, offered many commemorative models, and had a unique serial number order. This one is 94037665, the 165th guitar assembled on the 37th day of 1994. It is all original including the case. The guitar shows minor wear, a few small dings and scratches. Original frets with no perceivable wear and the binding covers the fret ends (unlike new Gibsons). Classic Banjo tuners. Neck width at the nut is a roomy 1 11/16\". Comfortable C shape neck contour stays consistant all the way up to the 18th fret, doesn't start slim and get fatter like the 60's necks. The Mahogany has some rare flame figuring. The original brown tolex / pink lining case is a big improvement over the 60's. It shows minor wear, tarnish on metal parts, and is missing part of the center combination latch, a common malady. This model is a faithful reproduction of the 1964 reverse Firebird V with 9 piece neck-through-body construction and two solid mahogany \"wings\", 2 mini-humbuckers, the no longer offered \"Banjo\" tuners and vintage style ABR-1 Tune-O-matic bridge.", "ItemID": "292915756448", "EndTime": "2019-01-16T19:39:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T04:15:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Firebird-V-Reissue-Electric-Guitar-1994-100th-Anniversary-w-case-Johnny-/292915756448", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Howard, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929157564488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA0NVgxNjAw/z/STsAAOSwLX5cOWba/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IfcAAOSw259cOWcI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0OFgxNjAw/z/0NsAAOSwikBcOWfe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kxMAAOSwnh5cOWcv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ciEAAOSwC9hcOWdF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dYsAAOSwKdpcOWdX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0SsAAOSw8~hcOWdP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/e3EAAOSwi3xcOWtP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3qYAAOSws2RcOWtX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/44sAAOSwiOZcOWgV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KbQAAOSwpLdcOWdf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/Ih0AAOSwYPNcOWgn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "81233", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pobrucer", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 616, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 66}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Firebird V Reissue Electric Guitar 1994 100th Anniversary w/ case Johnny!", "HitCount": 224, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good.
