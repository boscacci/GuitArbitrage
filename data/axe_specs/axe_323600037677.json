USA Only No refunds An iconic instrument updated by the legendary guitarist.When Steve Vai teamed up with Ibanez in 1987, little did he realize what a lasting impact his signature model guitar would have. Today, the JEM is an iconic instrument immediately identified with the legendary guitarist. As part of the Ibanez Premium series, the JEM77WDP is a high quality instrument created for the working pro. This latest version of the JEM, with its unique look, brings a new taste to the lineup. The JEM77WDP is crafted with a Rosewood top/Mahogany body along with a distinctive wooden pickguard, matching headstock, and wooden control knobs. Its elegant Tree of Life inlay prominently stretches along the contrasting Rosewood fretboard. The Wizard neck includes Jumbo frets finished with the Premium Fret Edge Treatment for smooth, comfortable performance. The Edge Zero II tremolo bridge features a lower profile design for comfort and a stud lock function for superior tuning stability. Electronics include two DiMarzio Dark Matter 2 humbucker pickups (one at the neck, one in the bridge) with an enchanting custom pickup grill and a DiMarzio Dark Matter 2 single coil pickup in the middle position for a wide array of rock tones. A soft case is included.
