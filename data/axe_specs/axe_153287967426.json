{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a near mint condition Squier CVC Telecaster. They get fantastic reviews and many say these are as good as the Fender branded telecasters. It plays like butter. This one has been played mostly at home, though infrequently, and is in \"like new\" condition. It has the original mint green pick guard as well as a white pearloid pick guard and a black pick guard (installed). All are shown in the pictures. There is an ash tray bridge cover as well. It also has a tweed gig bag, one rip is shown in the pictures and is at the top/back of the bag. We are going to attempt to sew it back up. Buyer to pay actual shipping cost, amount showing is just a general number, send me your location and I will send you actual shipping cost.", "ItemID": "153287967426", "EndTime": "2018-12-08T04:54:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-03T04:54:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-SQUIER-CLASSIC-VIBE-CUSTOM-TELECASTER-W-GIG-BAG-AND-EXTRAS-/153287967426", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bloomington, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532879674268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY3NQ==/z/utkAAOSwzd9cBLRd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDQxMQ==/z/mCQAAOSwXMxcBLRi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY3NQ==/z/zWMAAOSwjTtcBLRm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDM2OQ==/z/vAUAAOSwa3lcBLRt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIzWDEyMDA=/z/SysAAOSww-lcBLR3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODkwWDEyMDA=/z/mBQAAOSwylBcBLR8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUyWDEyMDA=/z/0SMAAOSw8L5cBLSB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t58AAOSwsGpcBaSu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "47403", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gustopher", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 81, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 297.64, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 297.64, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 234}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER SQUIER CLASSIC VIBE CUSTOM TELECASTER W/ GIG BAG AND EXTRAS", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 537, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 302.64, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
