{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1981 Washburn A-10-12, 12-string Electric Guitar - Incredibly rare!. I bought this guitar because I have never seen one like it before. I have to sell now because I work for the government and I'm currently not being paid. I need the money. It was built in 1980 or 1981 at the Yamaki Factory in Japan, alongside the famous Daion brand guitars, it has all of the defining touches that put it in truly famous and stupidly rare company. It was marketed as a part of the Stage Series but, unlike the other guitars in this series (that were made at the equally famous Matsumoku Factory) the handful of 12-string A-10's were made at the Yamaki Factory. The dead giveaway to its origin are the wood covers over the switch and control cavities. I don't know of any other factory in Japan that used this method except Yamaki. No serial number and no identification except for the truss rod cover. Set-neck construction, the rosewood fretboard and body are pearloid bound. Brass Nut, Push Pull Pots. Comes with a hard shell case made specifically for this guitar. It has some scratches and small dings, and I broke one of the high E strings. It's in incredible condition for an almost 40-year-old instrument! (See pics) The guitar appears to be all-original, except for the pickups, which I believe are Seymour Duncans. There are a few small dings. Please see all pictures. ITEM SOLD AS IS, NO RETURNS, SO PLEASE ASK ALL QUESTIONS PRIOR TO BIDDING or BUYING.
