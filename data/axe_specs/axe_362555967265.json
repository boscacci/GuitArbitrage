{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Every year we have a massive blowout sale, that clears out the warehouse of all the junk that piles up over the year. What's left we usually blow out online, and this year is no different. We have a surplus of used electric guitars, that need to go for some early spring cleaning, to make room and way for the new 2019 models. We have about 20 guitars in total (please check our other listings) that need to go, and all of them will vary in brand and condition. Assume, unless noted, that these will need completely gone over. Some of these are ready to go, some need a little help. These might be good for a great deal on parts, a new trio of addition to your collection, or a great opportunity to clean up/set up/fix up, and resell for a nice profit! The choice is up to you! All are sold as-is, with no warranty. SX- This just had a restring and setup before hitting the warehouse, so this shouldn't need much more than an overall look. Pickups are good, and electronics are clean. JBP- This also just had a restring and setup, so this should be close to being ready to go as well. The neck on this is awesome and plays well! First Act - Also new strings and setup, great neck and feel, sounds great! Cool graphic on it if you're into that sort of thing.
