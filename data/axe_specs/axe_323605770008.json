{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "HOLIDAY SALE &FREE USA SHIPPING! You do NOT see these offered for sale very often! This was quite a limited run from 2011, Made in Mexico and easily as nice as the USA version for a fraction of the price. Moderate player wear and come with a Deluxe Fender gig bag. The guitar has an alder body with some moderate figure and is finished in 3-tone sunburst. It looks like a nitro finish but there is no finish checking. The maple neck has a slab rosewood fretboard with 22 vintage-profile (small) frets just like an original 1960 model. What makes this guitar shine are the USA Noiseless pickups which give you all the vintage tone with NONE of the dreaded hum or noise! All 3 pickups are nice & strong The neck is clean and straight with very minimal fret wear and comes equipped with locking Fender Sperzel tuners. The guitar sill be fully set up with fretboard oiled and new strings. I'll make sure it arrives in 100% pro player condition. There are no sharp frets, buzzing or dead spots and the truss rod works great. There are some minor finish dimples in the area of the bridge that look like tiny knots in the alder. A few edge scuffs but no dings or chips and not even a hint of belt buckle wear. The truss rod works great and the guitar weighs just under 8 1/2 lbs. FREE USA SHIPPING and a 30-day return privilege if you are not happy for any reason. \"Buy it now\" before midnight Tuesday 12/18 and I will include a Fender 60th Anniversary leather strap as a bonus (just remind me!).", "ItemID": "323605770008", "EndTime": "2018-12-22T14:43:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T01:44:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-VINTAGE-DELUXE-1960-STRATOCASTER-SUNBURST-NOISELESS-PICKUPS-FREE-SHIP-/323605770008", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Scranton, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236057700088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTIxWDE2MDA=/z/iIkAAOSwfhlcGEmb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwOVgxNjAw/z/zzMAAOSw0YlcGEmk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0NFgxNjAw/z/8nkAAOSw-HRcGEmo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQzWDE2MDA=/z/jEIAAOSwi1lcGEmq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cwIAAOSwysFcGEms/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TnYAAOSwl5JcGEnD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFgxNjAw/z/WwEAAOSwGmZcGEmu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTE3WDE2MDA=/z/qNEAAOSwjwZcGEmz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzM0WDE2MDA=/z/V~YAAOSwM5tcGEm4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODk1WDE2MDA=/z/vsQAAOSw4VpcGEm8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjYyWDE2MDA=/z/GmkAAOSw2~NcGEnE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQ2WDE2MDA=/z/Z~4AAOSwQwFcGEnJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "18508", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bassrmh", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2087, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 435}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER VINTAGE DELUXE 1960 STRATOCASTER, SUNBURST, NOISELESS PICKUPS, FREE SHIP!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage Deluxe 1960 Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Deluxe Series"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["3-tone Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid Alder"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}]}, "HitCount": 277, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1060888262", "StoreName": "bassrmh"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "excellent condition, light player wear, minor marks", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
