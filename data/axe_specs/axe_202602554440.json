An upgraded top and an exclusive finish. This Gibson 2017 Les Paul Classic Plus Electric Guitar comes in an exclusive finish. Crafted from premium tonewoods, the Les Paul Classic Plus carries a highly figured Grade-AA maple top, which looks absolutely stunning beneath this exclusive high-gloss, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose lacquer. Classic Les Paul Standard appointments such as acrylic trapezoid fingerboard inlays and cream body and neck binding are accompanied by a deceptively powerful pair of humbucking pickups mounted \u201copen-coil\u201d for a modified look that sits great with the guitar\u2019s lack of pickguard, which also serves to show off the Les Paul Classic Plus\u2019s gorgeous wood. And, to top it all off, players will appreciate its comfortable SlimTaper neck profile. As with the best Les Pauls crafted since the early \u201950s, the Les Paul Classic Plus starts with the legendary tonewood pairing of a solid carved Grade-AA maple top glued to a Grade-A mahogany body. Marrying maple\u2019s clarity and definition to mahogany\u2019s richness and depth produces a tonal complexity that no single-wood guitar has ever matched. Its resonance and sustain are only further enhanced by the deep-set quarter-sawn mahogany neck with 17-degree back-angled headstock. Optimum playability is ensured by the SlimTaper neck profile and a 12-inch fingerboard radius for choke-free string bending. The guitar\u2019s 22-fret fingerboard is made from rosewood that offers a clear tone and extreme durability. To pump up all this tonal goodness to the max, Gibson loads the Les Paul Classic Plus with a pair of Zebra '57 Classic and Classic Plus humbucking pickups. A pairing of Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece ensures solid sustain and accurate intonation, while a set of Grover locking looks great and makes tune-up a breeze. Each guitar comes protected in a hardshell case with plush lining, includes an owner\u2019s manual and adjustment literature.
