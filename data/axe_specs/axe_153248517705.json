{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This has been sitting in my closet for over ten years waiting for me to refinish its body and play it, but I just don't play guitar enough to justify a refinishing it. All the finish on the fingerboard was removed during a re-fret job about 15 years ago and was sealed with refined linseed oil. There are several spots on the back of the neck where finish has worn off and have been sealed with the same oil. *Significant fret ware, but the last time I had it re fretted, it was with jumbo wire frets; so if you were to have frets dressed and leveled, you could polish them down to medium size wire. The 10th fret has a tiny ding. It comes with the original tuners and they work perfectly. I'm pretty certain this came from the Fullerton plant and its straight as an arrow. Feel free to ask me any questions.
