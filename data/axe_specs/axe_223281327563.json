What's the formula for incredible Guitar sound?? Oh how about using the BEST wood... The BEST hardware...The BEST tuners....The BEST pickups...And finish it off with the thinnest finish, hand massaged to give you the warm, silky, old-school feel of a guitar that's been on tour for a while. Yeah that's how we do it. DO NOT underestimate this guitar just because it's so ridiculously affordable. Look- This is the real deal. Designed by Earl Slick in his New York studio. Each body is SOLID swamp ash. Necks are SOLID Canadian Hard Rock Maple. Fingerboards are Indian Rosewood. This is a serious recipe for tone. Hardware? You want Hardware? Slick spec'd out the best. It all starts with our wraparound bridge- machined from a solid billet of BRASS- No finish. Raw. Naked. Nude. The knob is a machined brass billet piece as well. Just one volume, but an elongated control cavity so you can add a tone control if you want. The tuners are our own design, with a bronze crown gear and bronze pinion gear and SOLID BRASS knob- the result is a tuner with basically NO backlash. It's smooth and very accurate, and you'll stay in tune! We put a graphite nut on every neck, hand slotted. The tilt-back headstock allows us to get the exact correct string break at the nut for ALL SIX STRINGS, and no string trees mean better tuning stability. Each Slick guitar is strung with a set of New York made D'Addario EXL110 strings. We've gone with a Gibson standard 24 3/4\" scale length, a 12\" radius and a 43mm wide nut. The neck has twenty two nickel-silver 6105 profile medium jumbo frets, leveled, crowned and polished. Where the Slick SL59 really distinguishes itself is with the PICKUPS. We use a calibrated pair of Slick Brand, HAND AGED \"Slick Junior\" ALnico V pickups. Just the right amount of dirt- Alnico V bar magnets, Delrin bobbins, Formvar 42 gauge wire, German Silver baseplate and exact vintage correct plastic cover. The bridge is wound BIG at 9.6K, the Reverse Wound/Reverse Polarity neck is 8.0K. Even though these are true singlecoil pickups... in the middle position they are noise cancelling. These pickups are not just built from the right stuff, but we hand age them- both cosmetically and magnetically. They look like old pickups...feels like old pickups... sounds like old pickups. The feel and vibe is enhanced and preserved by the completely unique way that we finish Slick guitars. The solid ash body is NOT wood grain filled. It is NOT sealed. NO Polyurethane fillers. It's raw. We stain the wood and then spray a single coat of old fashioned automotive paint and sand it back. The pores don't get clogged so the wood can breathe. It works. It sounds better. Louder. Fuller. You can feel it instantly. The SL59 is a unique guitar, with a tone, feel and sound unmatched by anything under a grand out there. Try one. We think you'll be hooked!", "ItemID": "223281327563", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T06:44:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T02:45:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Slick-SL60-Aged-Surf-Green-Dual-P90-Pickup-Les-Paul-Jr-FREE-Shipping-/223281327563", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Secaucus, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232813275638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KCAAAOSwMBdbz7cO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bmIAAOSwdzRbz7WH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rnEAAOSwWSlbz7co/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ISEAAOSwetBbz7gu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rpMAAOSw46Fbz7g7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/l-kAAOSwC0dbz7hL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07094", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "leeboice", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 578, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***6", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 80}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Slick SL60 Aged Surf Green Dual P90 Pickup\u00a0 Les Paul Jr\u00a0 FREE Shipping", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Slick Guitar"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SL59"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Antique Black"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["P90 Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash, Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 212, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 227.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
