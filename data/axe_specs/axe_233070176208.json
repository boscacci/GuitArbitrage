Serial Number: 170084806 Weight: 7 lbs. 9 oz. A Modern Player with an Old Soul The benefits of a modern Gibson guitar and the appeal of a pawn shop prize \u2014 both are yours with the Gibson Les Paul Faded T. No, this guitar isn't relic'd. Rather, it's built to look and play like a Les Paul that has seen the insides of more than a few bars and clubs. The Les Paul Faded T's new-meets-old approach is exemplified in three key features: a SlimTaper maple neck shaped to mimic the natural wear of decades of playing; a weight-relieved mahogany body, which you'll be able and proud to strap on for hours at a time with its low weight and faded gloss finish; and a pair of Gibson 490 pickups that speak with a golden PAF-like tone, only with more bite and wax potting to reduce squeals. Plek'd for precision playability This Les Paul Faded 2017 T feels fast and precise, thanks in large part to Plek processing. Typically reserved for top-dollar custom guitars, this process levels the frets with pinpoint precision, providing you with the most playable fretboard you're likely to own. Each note rings loud and clear, and the fret edges feel smooth as silk. SlimTaper maple neck plays fast and smooth The maple neck on this Faded T Les Paul is a breath of fresh air. Its SlimTaper neck profile conforms naturally to the hand, for smooth leads up top and fast licks down low. Whatever your standard neck preference, you'll find something to appreciate about the Les Paul Faded T's pre-worn neck, which we agree, does play more like a vintage instrument than a brand-new one. Ultra-modern body is weight relieved for comfort You can't deny two fundamental guitar truths: early Les Pauls were glorious, but they were also heavy. That's the trade-off of strapping a solid slab of mahogany to your body. But Gibson has done something special with the Les Paul Faded T's Ultra-modern, weight-relieved body. It retains the chime and resonance of slab Les Pauls at a big reduction in weight. This just means you can enjoy yourself onstage for longer, and drag yourself out of bed earlier, with the Gibson Les Paul Faded T. Gibson 490 pickups are a modern take on a 1960s classic English guitarists of the 1960s were looking for a more aggressive sound to push their modern brand of blues, rock, and soul. Gibson responded with its 490 pickup set. These had more bite than Gibson's PAF (\"Patent Applied For\") pickups of the 1950s. The reissue 490T and 490R pay tribute to this turning point in rock history. Their voice is smooth and clearly vintage inspired, yet to our ears has more high-end cut and midrange chutzpah than vintage pickups. They're also wax potted to reduce microphonic feedback, which is a big win with high-gain amp pairings About Us Payment Shipping Terms Returns About UsWe offer a large selection of quality pre-owned musical instruments and equipment from the industries finest manufactures including Akai, Ampeg, Boss, Denon, Digidesign, DigiTech, Epiphone, Fender, Gibson, Gretsch, Guild, Ibanez, Korg, Lexicon, Line 6, Mackie, Mesa Boogie, Marshall, Martin, MusicMan, MXR, Neumann, Peavey, Pioneer, PRS, Roland, Shure, Tascam, Taylor, TC Electronic and Yamaha.
