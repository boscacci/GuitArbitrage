{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "IBANEZ ART300 BROWN CAIMAN ELECTRIC GUITAR CAYMAN ARTIST USED This guitar has one of the coolest looking and most unique tops I've ever seen. It plays great, has a nice balance and feel, and sounds fantastic, especially with a lot of gain. Has a rather dark, mysterious tone. Build quality is very good. Online reviews are overwhelmingly positive. It features a mahogany body with scalloped maple top, set neck, bound rosewood fretboard, 22 medium frets, 24.7 inch scale. Ibanez LZ active pickups use two AA batteries (included). There are 2 volume controls (one for each pickup) and 1 tone. Gibraltar bridge and Quik Change III tailpiece in black chrome have a quality look and feel. This particular guitar is in very good condition with almost no play wear. It has a few minor scratches on the back that are difficult to photograph. Top is not perfect but pretty close. Notice a small paint chip on the back side of the lower horn. I've been having some issues with the jack - it works fine with some cables and intermittently with others. I can pull the plug out slightly and it works fine. So, is it the cable or the jack? I don't know. It is being sold it as-is, be aware that there may be an issue there. This auction is for the guitar only, no case or anything else. All questions are welcome, please ask before bidding. Shipping is a flat rate of $40.00. It will most likely ship UPS Ground, tracking and insurance included.
