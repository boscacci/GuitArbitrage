{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a highly Custom Carvin/Kiesel CT6!! It was built in Dec. 2014 and this was right on the cusp of switching from Carvin to Kiesel. I worked extensively with Jeff to bring my ideas to fruition and this was the one that got the whole \"back as pretty as the front\" trend kick-started. As soon as they posted the picture of the back of this baby the orders for similar guitars started pouring in. I was rather proud of that. :)It was also featured in a Carvin catalog as can be seen in the pictures. I was also lucky enough to have had a few great professional pics taken by at Kiesel as well as build process pics taken by Jeff himself. I have also included the spec sheet and the guitar is still in amazing condition. A few highlights of features........ 5A Quilted top in Aqua Burst 5A Quilted back in AquaQuilted maple Headstock (front & back) color matching Mahogany Body Flamed Maple Neck Toasted Birdseye Maple Fretboard Stainless Steel Frets Abalone Block InlaysQuilted maple truss rod cover Floyd Rose Trem Abalone knobs (Coil Tap push/pull tone knob) It only has normal play-ability wear and has been gigged aprox. 10 times since I purchased it. Only selling because I don't play as much as I used to and it is a shame to let a great guitar like this sit not being used. The only difference that I made was when I ordered it, Jeff was still working on the newly designed K12 pickups and they weren't quite ready but a month or so after it was done he sent me a set of creme K12's and I had those installed in here. The original pickup set will come with this guitar (S22j S22b) as well as the original tweed hard shell case and straplocks. Jeff also made me a quilted maple truss rod cover that really popped on this guitar.It is setup right now to Dive Only on the Floyd Rose (I just prefer the feel and stability of a dive only) but can easily be set back to floating during a string change. I had them install a set screw under the bridge so that it stops it from pulling it up. Remove the set screw or screw it down further in the wood and you are right back to floating. I posted a picture that may help in visualizing what I am referring to as well as a few action shots and other various pictures.It really is a gorgeous instrument that was as close to a Kiesel Edition as you could get at the time this was built, we pulled no stops in this build at all. The original order total was $3139.00 so I am selling this build at a great price so hopefully she finds a great home.Any questions feel free to ask.
