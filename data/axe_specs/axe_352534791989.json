{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I've listed this Carvin Kit Partscaster a few times with no takers. If it doesn't sell this time, it's okay. I'll simply keep her. As you can see by the images, it's a beautiful guitar that still need a truss rod cover and back plate. I never got around to picking them up due to my schedule and having too many other guitars. I've used this very sparingly since buying it over a year ago. I used it in my studio for recording on a few songs and was extremely pleased with its tone and playability. The past few listings of this guitar, I was asked repeatedly questions I can't answer since I didn't build it. This guitar came out of Idaho already built and I am 2 times removed from the original owner. I know the gorgeous neck is Birdseye maple with MJ frets with a natural ash body. The tone is definitely there and if there is, in fact any finish to the body, it's so thin as to be negligible. The tuners are Sperzel locking and tremolo is Wilkinson. I don't know the neck radius and since I've never been a \"Strat\" guy, I won't guess. I can say, for me at least, the neck is comfortable. Not fat or thin. I also don't know if the frets are SS or not. Carvin is known for using SS, but am uncertain if this kit came with them. Will ship Priority USPS within 24 hours.
