{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "If you are looking at this ad and thinking of buying one of these Ibanez AKJV90D guitars, then please take a closer look at what we are offering here. This example is in perfect condition. This model is just a ton of value for the price point. Just look at the quality of the flamed maple back and sides, solid spruce top, and a five piece neck. This one is in pristine shape! There is no fretwear and the only thing that shows any wear at all is the pickguard. This was owned as a backup instrument by a touring professional musician. Because of his touring, he put this in a Gator ATA molded case that alone sells for 179 dollars. You get the Ibanez that sells for 699 new, and the Gator case that sells for 179 dollars. There is no better buy out there that I have found, and I believe you won't either!", "ItemID": "264141173949", "EndTime": "2019-01-22T22:14:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-15T22:14:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Artcore-AKJV90D-Hollow-Electric-Guitar-Amber-Low-Gloss-Used-Condition-/264141173949", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Middle Island, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641411739498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/SikAAOSwVN1cK-Zr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4V8AAOSws0pcK-aL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/CgMAAOSwBVdcK-aM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/VjsAAOSwo1lcK-aQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/p-kAAOSwz3FcK-aN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/s98AAOSw5bxcK-aO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/oAAAAOSwVcZcK-a6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/LnIAAOSwhEhcK-bF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11953", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rkostone", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1167, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 157}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Artcore AKJV90D Hollow Electric Guitar Amber Low Gloss, Used Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["AKJV90D Dark Amber Low Gloss"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["AKJV90DDAL"]}]}, "HitCount": 71, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 385.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
