{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Selling this Penco Les Paul, manufactured in Japan in the '70's. This guitar has been modded as follows: - Grover tuners- Seymour Duncan '59 N in the neck position (the bridge pickup is a 'no name' pickup)- New bridge added This is a solidly made guitar and feels very different from modern Chinese/Indonesian made Les Paul copies by the likes of Epiphone (of which I've owned a few). The guitar has a bolt-on neck. The guitar has been played a lot over the years and has dings and scrapes that you might expect from a guitar of this age. I've taken photos of a couple of the worst of these, though as the guitar is black they don't show so much. I took the pickguard off - it can be included if you want it. Free shipping. No international sales. Will ship to the Continental US only.", "ItemID": "323627300549", "EndTime": "2019-01-05T19:10:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-29T19:10:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Penco-Les-Paul-Copy-70s-Made-Japan-/323627300549", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chatham, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236273005498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ImUAAOSweiFcJ8Ui/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QuUAAOSwxL5cJ8Uq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0MgAAOSwFoNcJ8Ux/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zYsAAOSwE~ZcJ8U5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SaIAAOSwQqNcJ8Uc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ThAAAOSw6CRcJ8VE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VDIAAOSw7wFcJ8VM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tMkAAOSwMKFcJ8Ul/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "12037", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "greenr_64", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 137, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 232.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 232.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 379}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Penco Les Paul Copy - '70's Made in Japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Penco"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 404, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 235.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
