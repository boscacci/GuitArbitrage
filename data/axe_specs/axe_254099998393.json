{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement. I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier Standard Series FSR \"Custom Shack Strat\". The Squier maple/rosewood neck has mild fret wear ,and has the headstock that matches the body color. The very cool Satin Gray Body looks very nice, just mild surface scratches. The bridge and neck pickup has been upgraded with hot all black Hex Pole humbuckers,9k-neck,15k-bridge. The middle rail type humbucker pickup is quite hot at 9k. I changed the stock neck tone control to a push/pull pot so you can split the neck and bridge humbuckers into single coils. With the 5 way switch this gives you 9 different pickup combinations. The guitar has been wired for tone control on all three pickups.The bridge and neck pickups both work with the neck pickups tone control. Nice to have tone control on the bridge pickup,makes it a lot more versatile. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The capacitors have been upgraded with a Japanese .015 polyester film capacitor. More range of tone control and a smoother response. I added the white pearl pickguard,rear tremolo cover,and black volume and tone knobs,switch tip and whammy bar tip to complete the early 60's vibe I was going for. This guitar sounds really good,and it looks like a classic. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody instead of working!
