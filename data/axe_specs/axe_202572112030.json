{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a 1996 PRS McCarty model with a black finish and nickel hardware. Nothing complicated here. just a simple mean player in great shape. This is an early McCarty, which is designated by the \u201cMcCarty Model\u201d on the back of the headstock. She's in amazing condition with OHSC and ready to rock the house down! 1994 was the first year for the McCarty Model, originally released with Dragon II pickups. In 1995 Paul released the McCarty pickups to really set this model apart. As a collector it's my opinion these early MCs will be collectable at some point so they will hold there value very well!

It's lite perfectly balanced in your hands, stays in tune and just kicks serious rear!!! She just celebrated her 23rd birthday and has been very well cared for. This is a 23 year old black gloss guitar, so I\u2019m not going over-state the condition\u2026 There are some minute surface scratches throughout, as to be expected with any black gloss guitar but again, this guitar is in amazing shape for it's age. There is also typical wear on the hardware. The neck is straight, with no cracks or repairs and the frets are excellent, with PLENTY of life ahead of them! -Plays like silk!
