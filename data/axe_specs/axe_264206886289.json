{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender American Standard Stratocaster (1989-90) with upgrade Lindy Fralin Vintage Hot pickups. As pictures show, this guitar is in outstanding condition. One minor nick in the paint below the pickup selector (see picture). Otherwise, no flaws, scratches or dents in the finish. Sounds and plays fantastic. Neck is smooth and straight, and fretboard has been well conditioned and cared for through the years. The neck profile is my favorite thing in the first generation American Standards (I have a 1990 that I'm keeping). Frets are around 75%. No buzz at all and I can get a nice low action. The installed pickups are a new set of Lindy Fralin Vintage Hot single coils (3 months old). Quick note: though they are called \"Hot\", the neck and middle are actually spec'd to be vintage Strat. The bridge is over-wound 10% to make it a little fuller (i.e., not a thin sounding bridge pickup). Also, the bridge pickup has the upgrade metal base plate for even better sound. Each pickup sounds great; each has a really usable tone (check out YouTube demos). I'm also including the original pickups (see picture), which are in really good condition. When I had pickups changed three months ago, the tech did a thorough inspection inside and was impressed with good condition of the electronics. Quick note about pricing. Similar period Amer. Standard Strats sell for $750 - $800, depending on condition. Lindy Fralin Vintage Hots sell for around $250. Combined, this guitar is a $1,000 + value, plus the original pickups are included as well. I'm asking $875. Heck, someone could buy, switch out the pickups to the original ones, sell the Lindys for $250-ish, and recover some of the cost. When a guitar reaches 30 years old, it's getting into \"vintage\" territory and deserves a good home. Comes with original Fender hard shell case, which is in very good condition. Also included is the whammy bar. I have very positive eBay feedback and have sold a couple of guitars. Buy with confidence!
