{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "AllParts Strat Electric Guitar Double-Cutaway Right-Handed Natural w/Gig Bag For sale is a very well-made, Strat-style parts guitar in a natural finish! I believe it features a maple body, maple neck with rosewood fingerboard, a three-ply white pickguard with three single-coils, chrome vintage-style tremolo, tone/tone/volume knobs and chrome tuners. The body was beautifully finished, with a perfect, high-gloss clearcoat and the guitar plays great and sounds wonderful. Aside from lighter, normal wear throughout, the frets show no wear and all hardware/electronics function perfectly! Ships in a gig bag.
