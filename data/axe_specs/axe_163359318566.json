{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is my 2006 Fender Squier Stratocaster. Beautiful guitar. This has been upgraded to the features of a Fender \"Player's\" Strat. This means it has Fender \"Vintage Noiseless\" pickups, and the wiring has been modified. The original Player's Strat had vintage noiseless pickups and a pushbutton switch which gives you the two additional pickup combinations that are missing from other strats. Neck-bridge and neck-middle-bridge. Mine has the same wiring except that it has a mini toggle switch instead of a pushbutton switch. I've never seen another one like it. It's about a $200 upgrade. Unlike many of the instruments that I sell on eBay, this was my personal guitar that I bought new and I used it on stage for a couple of years. It is used, so it shows the wear you would expect on a used guitar, but It is still a great playing, great looking guitar. I have just decided to sell some instruments that I rarely play anymore. Opening bid is $150 with no Reserve and $40 shipping to the lower 48. No shipping outside of the USA. Questions? Email Rick via eBay and I will do my best.", "ItemID": "163359318566", "EndTime": "2018-11-14T05:13:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-07T05:13:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-Standard-Stratocaster-Players-Strat-upgrade-/163359318566", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Napa, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633593185668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VCwAAOSwdWdbrj~R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Wi4AAOSwpmhbrj~U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uzsAAOSwvupbrj~Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PisAAOSwXpFbrj~b/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EX0AAOSwmZJbrj~f/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94558", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "yeruglysister", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 535, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 225}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squier Standard Stratocaster Player's Strat upgrade!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Standard Stratocaster Rosewood Fretboard"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Squier"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Player's Strat Upgrade"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Squier Standard"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}]}, "HitCount": 215, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 152.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
