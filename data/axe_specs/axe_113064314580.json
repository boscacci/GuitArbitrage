The following is a stock description: EVH Wolfgang Special Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance:A complete and total shred machineQuartersawn neck for stability and playabilityFloyd Rose tremolo allows for twisting, bending, and huge dive-bombsA complete and total shred machineFrom its basswood body to its maple neck and fingerboard, this EVH Wolfgang Special just screams quality - and that's just the tonewoods! This gorgeous guitar is made for serious playing, with a compound-radius fingerboard, an EVH Floyd Rose bridge and locking nut, and direct-mounted EVH humbuckers. The controls are top-notch, too: you get a handy 3-way pickup selector switch and low-friction volume and tone pots for total control over your tone and volume. All the components come together to make a guitar that looks absolutely stunning and plays even better.Quartersawn neck for stability and playabilityThe neck is one of the most important aspects of any instrument, which is why this EVH Wolfgang Special features a quartersawn maple neck. Besides looking good, the straight grain of quartersawn necks is significantly more stable than plain-sawn necks and less likely to warp, twist, or shrink. You'll also love the playability and feel of the compound-radius fretboard on this Wolfgang Special. The fretboard radius goes from 12\" at the nut to a comfortable and flat 16\" radius on the upper frets.Floyd Rose tremolo allows for twisting, bending, and huge dive-bombsFirst gaining popularity in the 1980s, the Floyd Rose tremolo's locking design keeps your guitar in tune, even if you like to perform extreme pitch pyrotechnics. You can force the whammy bar all the way down to the guitar's body for psychotic dive-bombing. You can pull the whammy bar up to the stratosphere, raising your tone by as much as a seventh. No matter how hard you're shredding, you'll maintain your tuning stability, thanks to the Floyd Rose tremolo's locking design. On top of that, you can easily switch to drop D tuning, courtesy of the Wolfgang Special's D-Tuna tremolo device!EVH Wolfgang Special Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:Designed by rock legend Eddie Van Halen for ultimate shredabilityBasswood body and dual EVH pickups deliver resonant tone, sustain, and crunchCompound-radius allows for exceptional speed and comfortEVH-branded Floyd Rose tremolo allows for twisting, bending, and dive-bombingD-Tuna tremolo device gives you instant drop-D tuningBelly cut allows the guitar to fit comfortably against your torsoThe EVH Wolfgang Special solidbody electric guitar puts the tonal tool of a legendary guitarist in your hands!
