{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here I have a beautiful set neck Lotus Les Paul that I personally purchased in 1979. It has beautiful transparent walnut finish, set up just like a Les Paul with the original zebra humbuckers which sound fantastic. I recently upgraded the pots and caps from the tiny thumbnail size pots to CTS 500K's and upgraded caps. The tone is amazing. Great action on the guitar with virtually no fret wear. Trapezoid mother of pearl inlay on the rosewood fingerboard and headstock, brass nut (common for the era), and a coil tap switch connected to the neck pickup. When the neck PU is selected it can be either single coil or humbucker, in the middle position switch with the coil tap on you get a cool out of phase sound, and you can simply switch back to full humbuckers. Everything works perfect, excellent action, and fingering. Truss rod works great, tuners are fully functional. Amazing tone, set neck, full body and neck binding aged to the perfect off white color. Cosmetically the guitar is in great condition. The worst wear on the guitar is on the back of the neck where there are a few ring dings, but it does not affect the awesome playability. This is a great vintage guitar, very well built and upgraded to USA standards as far as the electronics are concerned. You can get a killer vintage Les Paul at a great price. I do not have a case for it but it will be packaged really good for safe shipping with FedEx. Questions hit me up. I was told by my guitar tech that this was the top of the line Lotus made in the same plant as the Tokai's of the era, at the Moridaira plant. Bottom line is you will not find a guitar this cool for this price. This is a real rock machine, but it has great blues tones as well. Ask any questions you may have.
