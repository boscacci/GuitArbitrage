{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1970s Electra LP Guitar Wine Red Excellent Shape High Quality This is one hell of a guitar. It plays like a vintage les paul for fraction of the price. I never realized how cool these guitars were till i sat down and played with it. Real rocker here folks! Really sweet player and tone. I always found these be very beautiful guitars. Excellent design and original looking. They are well made guitars as well. Solid woods very much like a fender or gibson quality. Sound thick and creamy! Secret weapon here! Everything is stock to the guitar and it plays works wonderfully.Guitar is very clean for its age. Been in storage for decades! All relatively light wear and tear. The frets are in excellent condition and everything works. Overall this guitar is in great shape. The guitar has minor superficial dings, scratches, wear and tear around various parts of the guitar. Typical of a guitar of this age. As with any guitar that\u2019s been sitting in storage it going to need new strings and set up. Please consider this when bidding on my items. Its vintage folks and anything this old could need a minor tune up. Shipping, Payment & Important Details Your item will be shipped immediately after I receive payment.
