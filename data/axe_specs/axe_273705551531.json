{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Limited Edition ES-335 One of 75.I removed the silly \u201canchor studs\u201d and put the proper Gibson \u201ccustom\u201d badge on from the CS. Although the studs are included if you prefer that look.This is a 60\u2019s reissue VOS Es-335 with bigsby. One of 75 (heard it was actually 28).Mint condition minus a 1/2\u201d indention on the front via a keyfob that pressed against it, seen in certain light and not through clear coat.Comes in original case with COA, strap and Gibson tool.Absolutely killer ES, looks, sound and plays like a dream. These were around $4600 new. One of the best looking Gibson\u2019s I\u2019ve ever seen in person.The Gibson Limited Edition ES-335 Anchor Studio Bigsby VOS Electric Guitar is a classic Rock 'n' Roller with a modern makeover. Originally, if you wanted a Bigsby on your Gibson ES-335, you would need to custom order that feature from the factory. To accommodate these orders, Gibson would take a production ES-335 and simply install a Bigsby. However, a creative solution was necessary to address the now exposed anchor stud bushings. While most are familiar with the legendary Custom Made plate, few examples reflect the more crude solution, the ground down anchor studs. We've brought it back for 2018 and the result is pure \"Rock 'n' Roll Mojo.\" With classic features like a 1950s body shape with mouse ear horns, hot hide glue neck joint, and vintage-style Kluson Keystone tuners, this guitar will take you back in time.Body:- Top 3-ply Maple/Poplar/Maple- Back 3-ply Maple/Poplar/Maple- Centerblock Weight Relieved Maple- Bracing Quarter Sawn Adirondack Spruce- Binding Single-ply CreamNeck:- Neck Quarter Sawn Mahogany- Neck profile Rounded \"C,\" Rolled Binding- Fingerboard Rosewood- Inlays Mother of Pearl Small Block- Nut Bone- Nut Width 1.687\"- Scale Length 24.75\"- Number of Frets 22Hardware:- Finish VOS Nickel- Bridge ABR-1 with titanium saddles- Tailpiece Aluminum B-7 Bigsby Tremelo- Tuners Kluson Double Ring Keystones- Knobs Black Top Hats with Silver InsertsElectronics:- Neck pickup MHS Humbucker Rhythm- Bridge pickup MHS Humbucker Lead- Controls MTC Premiere - 2 volumes, 2 tones, 1 toggle switch, hand-wired with matched 550K potentiometers and orange drop capacitorsFinish/Quantity Made:- Case Hardshell- Limited Quantity of 75 ProducedDimensions and Weight in PackagingAntique EbonyShipping Weight: 24 lbsShipping Dimensions: 47 x 20 x 7 inManufacturer Part Number (MPN): ES33518EBNB1Antique Vintage SunburstShipping Weight: 24 lbsShipping Dimensions: 47 x 20 x 8 inManufacturer Part Number (MPN): ES33518VSNB1", "ItemID": "273705551531", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T18:43:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-16T18:43:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Es-335-VOS-60s-Reissue-2018-Ebony-Bigsby-Anchor-Electric-Guitar-1-75-/273705551531", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Evansville, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2737055515318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ3OFg4MTk=/z/O1UAAOSwyApcPf2e/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyNFgxNTAw/z/jg4AAOSwf29cPf0F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI0/z/1-AAAOSwcdBcPf0I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI0/z/k4wAAOSwqztcPf0M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI0/z/8IwAAOSwwZVcPf0P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI0/z/jisAAOSwf29cPf0T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI0/z/u2IAAOSwHrlcPf0U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI0/z/FsQAAOSwmE9cPf0W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwMFgxMTI0/z/UCoAAOSwCCRcPf0Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "47715", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "framusguy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 475, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 46, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2426.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2426.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "4***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 614}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Es-335 VOS 60's Reissue 2018 Ebony Bigsby Anchor Electric Guitar 1 of 75!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 760, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2451.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "mint-", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
