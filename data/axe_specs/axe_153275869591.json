{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hey Hello, Up for your consideration is a great vintage project that's 99% finished, all you need is a case and some patience\" a lot of of PATIENCE.Its a players guitar from the late 60's early 70'sYou'll get TWO sets of wiring harnesses with original pots,treble boost/sonic boom, knobs etc. All era correct. Serial Number ? Also two extra gretsch knobs, a few extra pots,Two extra gretsch strap buttons with screws, a reissue gretsch truss rod wrench.Although the binding is deteriorating a bit for its age it is very secure and intact. It is missing a 1\" piece on the neck. As far as I know everything works but it is being sold as is.After the sixth time trying to wire this $%@# I gave up and ran the pickups straight to jack. This is the second Rally I've owned and they are fun to play but I don'y have the time or money to invest in this guitar as I had hoped due to another gretsch project.Guitar weighs 6 lbs 6 ozSome photos are from the previous owner.The main photo of the whole guitar on the bed spread is what it currently looks like.Nothing is hooked up besides the pickups straight to the jack. Comes with a soft case.
