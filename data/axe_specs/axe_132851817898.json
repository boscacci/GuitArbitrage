Information:The Fender Pawn Shop Jaguarillo Electric Guitar hot-rods traditional Jaguar design through the roof with a scorching HSS configuration in which all three pickups - two standard Stratocaster single-coils and an Atomic humbucking bridge pickup - are angled for enhanced bass and treble response. The Jaguar scale length permits the use of heavier gauge strings for a fuller sound while also still making string bends a breeze. Other unusual touches include a streamlined control layout (volume knob, tone knob and five-way blade pickup switch) and an Adjusto-Matic bridge with vintage-style floating tremolo tailpiece. This is no ordinary Jaguar. Pawn Shop Series guitars are inspired by the more eccentric Fender creations of the mid-\u212260s to mid-\u212270s, which sometimes found their way to the outside world and into the more esoteric pages of Fender history. Crafted for thoroughly modern sound and quality, they present a creative alchemy of diverse Fender elements. New for 2012, the Pawn Shop Series introduces an unconventional new assortment of \u0153guitars that never were but should have been.
