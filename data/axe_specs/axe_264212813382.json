{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1961 Gibson SG Reissue, Made is USA, 2005. Condition is Used. THIS ITEM IS PRICED TO SELL - THIS IS THE LAST WEEK THIS GUITAR WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE I purchased this guitar in 2006, and this guitar immediately became a go-to guitar for me on recording sessions both in the rock world but also the ambient world of film scores. The SG has an indistinguishable sound - and it really does sound like those classic rock records. The biting midrange of the bridge Humbucker pickup can not be matched by any other guitar out there. I always said the SG had a far more \"impolite\" sound than its cousin, the Les Paul, and that's what drew me to this particular guitar. If I was going to play on a rock record, I wanted the track to be a little nastier than my competitors.
