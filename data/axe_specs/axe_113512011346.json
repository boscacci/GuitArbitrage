{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This was a promotional guitar not really sold to the public, but for dealers to give away or sell to their best clients, its \u201cMiller Lite\u201d Silver finish is oh-so cool for any home bar or club scene, its rose neck is quite playable & it is a genuinely a good quality guitar from overseas. The only blemish I can see is a small scratch on the back that looks like it came from a strap. Customer satisfaction is very important to us.
