{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a beautiful sunburst 2012 Fender American Standard Stratocaster with original case and accessories. Note: The first three pictures are from the place where I originally bought this guitar and are actual images of the one you are buying (I wasn't quite able to get the right lighting to accurately show the finish quality with my camera so I just went with these). This guitar weighed in at a Fed Ex facility on a certified scale at very comfortable 7.6 lbs. 2012 was the first year for the newly updated American Standard Strat featuring Fender's Custom Shop Fat 50s single coil pickups and \"aged\" plastic parts. I bought it as an N.O.S. item (New Old Stock) in early 2014 - from Rainbow Guitars in Tucson Arizona (an awesome guitar shop!). I will include the original receipt with this auction. This guitar is all original and is in very good condition, with the only notable exception being some small dings in the upper horn section of the body. I was able to capture it with my camera when the light hits it at certain angle, otherwise its fairly difficult to see. The rest of the guitar is in excellent condition with only minimal signs of use. I really like this guitar but hardly ever play it these days, so I've decided to let it go in order to pay off some other music gear I recently purchased. I just put a fresh set of D'Addario 10-46 strings on it. Also included in this auction is an aged white tremolo bar tip (the original tip, which is bright white, is also included). So, if you want a fantastic looking and playing, all American made Stratocaster, with the original case and accessories, then this guitar would be hard to beat imho. Shipping is free! It will be well-packed and insured. Check out my positive feedback and you'll see that I have sold quite a few guitars and guitar related items and everyone has been happy with their purchases, so bid with confidence! Shipping will require a signature. I will not ship outside the continental United States. I accept PayPal only. Thanks and Good Luck!Dan", "ItemID": "323633943634", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T18:37:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T18:37:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Sunburst-Am-Std-Strat-w-Case-/323633943634", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Stewartville, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236339436348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE2WDkwMA==/z/7jIAAOSwVcVcLlPY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzkzWDExMDA=/z/KuUAAOSw11BcLlPf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzkwWDExMDA=/z/IHcAAOSwEHhcLlPi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzc2/z/5PIAAOSw2zRcLlP-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAzN1gxNjAw/z/9NMAAOSwWI5cLlQF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-VgAAOSwtQNcLlQc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6lwAAOSwI01cLlQg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zaAAAOSwe7ZcLlQm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OwEAAOSwOcpcLlQr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDAy/z/zaMAAOSwe7ZcLlQw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDM4/z/Y3QAAOSwjfdcLlRT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SdQAAOSwwqVcLlRX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "55976", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "danzprod", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 593, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 745.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 745.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***4", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 686}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2012 Fender American Standard Stratocaster Sunburst Am Std Strat w/ Case +", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 240, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 755.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
