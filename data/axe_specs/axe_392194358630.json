{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding bought this from a well known Japanese blues and jazz player whose name is on the original case--case has no bad smells like tobacco smoke or mold and is clean inside and not bad outside with the original owner's name on it--It's had a re-fret in keeping with the quality required by a professional musician and the frets are in great shape--it also has the stop tail bridge replacing the trapeze tailpiece which is a mod most players do at some point for the added sustain--i didn't fill the holes because i considered restoring it to a trapeze but decided to sell it instead after buying a 66 es-335 that has the trapeze on it--i like the stop tail better as it turns out.The guitar as you can see has been very well cared for by someone who made a living with it--there's some minor bumps and swirl--the neck is excellent--the neck angle at factory specs--the truss rod works and has more turns if desired but right now it's in perfect playing shape after my luthier went over it prior to selling it--the action is superb with it at 3/32nds at the 12th fret e string with no buzzing--Around the place where the trapeze tail piece was there's some dark discoloration on the binding which looks of all things like shoe polish--i'm guessing it's interaction with a strap or cord but since it has no affect on anything i didn't bother trying to remove it with alcohol or some other cleaning agent-- the one thing to note is the headstock shown in the last scan--there's a familiar slight partial separation at the top--you can see this--the wood is rock solid and it's been this way for most of its life--my luthier wasn't worried about it--i asked about filling or compressing it and he fiddled with it a bit and said it's not going anywhere so leave it alone-- the sound is superb--it's been a blues guitar its entire life--a side story--i became friends with the original owner in Tokyo on Facebook and got some back story on the instrument--he bought a new guitar after almost 40 years--and have been able to hear him and his band play--they are awesome.No real checking to speak of--no buckle rash--clean headstock and a brazilian fretboard in excellent condition--ready to go to work right out of the case with new strings and set up for my preferences. please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392194358630", "EndTime":
