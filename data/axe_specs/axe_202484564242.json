{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a heavily played 2014 Charvel SoCal HH with a Floyd Rose tremolo. It was made in Mexico. The head stock has been painted black, and a new charvel decal was applied. The bridge pickup is an EVH Frankenstein pickup, and a white pick guard was installed. Please look at the pictures before bidding. This has been played, and the starting bid reflects that. The body has paint chips around the neck pocket, but no cracks. If you are looking for a mint condition guitar, do not bid. The neck has fret wear, and the low E string frets out above the 12th fret. Other than that it plays well and still sounds great. The string height is about 1.5mm at the 12th fret. Please ask questions before bidding. Strap locks are not included. I only accept Pay Pal as method of payment. Payment must be made within Three days after auction ends. Thanks for your interest.", "ItemID": "202484564242", "EndTime": "2018-11-04T21:05:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T01:23:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Charvel-Pro-Mod-So-Cal-Style-1-Made-2014-/202484564242", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Wellsville, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2024845642428080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/A0AAAOSwz5hb1lvS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EjgAAOSw6Pxb1lvW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BZ8AAOSw5dhb1lvT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/E60AAOSwqIhb1lvV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0C8AAOSw5oxb1lvO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OCYAAOSw2bFb1lva/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G9oAAOSw29Jb1lvY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RmkAAOSwu~5b1lvM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wwIAAOSw0rBb1lvQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "14895", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "146200", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 142, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 46}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Charvel Pro Mod So Cal Style 1 Made In 2014", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}]}, "HitCount": 497, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "219495684", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
