{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Fender Stratocaster Fullerton AVRI 1984/62 Reissue. 1984 Fullerton reissue, by neck date, towards the end of production out of the Fullerton Plant. The guitar really appears to be built towards the end of the Fullerton era, dates all over the place. Look at the pictures pots are untouched solder joints. Please note I did have another pickguard and pickup, pots set up in it for awhile then changed it back years ago as you can see by the splice and the solder on the volume pot. The strat does have great checking and some dings, play wear on the neck. Other cool feature the neck has a ton of birds eye markings which shows nicely with the age of the guitar. To sum it up the strat is a player and as noted by the neck wear it was played allot, I had it set up it Nov.2018 and it has been stored since.Another thing to note from my experience and learning over the years in buying and selling guitars and from the pro who set up this guitar, coming from a dry climate to a state with humidity can and affect the neck. As of the writing of this listing the neck and set up are perfect with very low action, intonation is spot on and plays up and down the neck with ease and frets have lots of life. I have allot more pictures and can be sent upon request by serious parties.Note: PNAH. The standard details list this guitar as a left hand for those who do not know the difference its a right hand.
