You are looking at a 2011 Gibson Les Paul Traditional Pro. Do you love Les Pauls but need a bit more versatility? Check out a Les Paul Traditional Pro! Vintage looks and feel with made in the USA quality. Just like a 50s Les Paul, the body is mahogany and features a carved maple top. The 24.75 inch scale mahogany neck features a bound rosewood fingerboard with pearloid trapezoid inlays. The bridge pickup is a Burstbucker 3 while the neck is a standard 57 Classic. This combo has a great Classic Rock tone that's close to a traditional PAF. Push/Pull pots allow for a variety of split coil sounds. Tuneomatic bridge, Stopbar tailpiece and Grover Locking tuners keep it rock solid. The finish is a classic Gold color. The top is gloss while the back is a vintage satin. An incredible looking and performing guitar.This Les Paul plays and sounds great. The neck plays well and the action is good. These come from the factory set up by a PLEK machine. Excellent playability. The pickups deliver a variety of tones. The Les Paul Standard Traditional Pro has everything players love about the Les Paul. Killer looks, great tone and excellent feel. A great guitar worthy of its namesake. Nut Width: 1.69\" Weight: 9.35 lbs. ***The Top Has been Refinished*** The former owner tried to \"Relic\" the top on this Les Paul. He failed miserably. I had our luthier refinish the Top only. It came out great! Originally this guitar was Gold so we just refinished it in the same Gold color. The rest of the guitar we left alone. The back has a few chips and scratches. Neck, Fretboard and Headstock are original. The only thing that has been touched is the Gold Top itself. Beautiful job! Complete Package with Tweed Hard Shell Case Included! Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. Cosmetics: Good Condition. As I mentioned earlier the Top has been refinished so the Top is pristine. The back has some typical belt buckle rash from being held next to the players body. There are a few chips in the finish on the inside edge of the bout as well as a couple next to the control plate. Headstock has a few chips at the tip. Neck and fretboard is in fine shape. Pickguard has been removed. The screw holes are still there if you wanted to buy a pickguard and install it yourself. Tweed Hard Shell Case has some scuffs, scratches and tears in the tweed covering. (See picture #8). Dripping with \"Mojo\". It is used. Not perfect. Overall, a really nice guitar. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story.
