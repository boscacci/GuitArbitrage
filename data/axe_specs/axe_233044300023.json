{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Mexico made. Serial: MZ2005305 Notes: Has a superficial crack in the paint behind the neck. This was on the guitar when I bought it from Guitar Center in 2002, and it looks the same as it did then. There is minor rust around the topmost strap button (pictured), which I could replace but I'd rather include all original pieces. The potentiometer (volume knob) is also loose. It controls volume as expected, but it will move a little bit past in either direction. This doesn't effect the sound at all and I get the same sound as ever when I play it. I have never tried to get it serviced and don't know how to fix that myself, so I knocked a bit off the price to make up for potential service costs. However, if it doesn't bother you, it can be played fine as is and you get it a bit cheaper than the others. All considered I would rate the condition as good to very good.", "ItemID": "233044300023", "EndTime": "2019-01-05T23:47:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-12T22:23:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Tom-Delonge-Signature-Fender-Stratocaster-2002-Seafoam-Green-/233044300023", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bloomington, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330443000238080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2-AAAOSwlx9cEY0T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4W0AAOSwYUZcEYzx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DlMAAOSwMjpcEYz0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pJEAAOSwosdcEYz5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TyAAAOSwkFZcEYz~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Fl0AAOSw1jpcEY0B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U2IAAOSwJ7RcEY0H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2L0AAOSwOt5cEY0G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "47408", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tech_and_music", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 20, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 56}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Tom Delonge Signature Fender Stratocaster 2002 Seafoam Green", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Surf green"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 1228, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mexico made.
