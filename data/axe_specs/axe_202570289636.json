{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "AAA Flame Maple Top and Futuristic FeaturesThe Epiphone Ltd. Edition Genesis Deluxe PRO would combine a solid mahogany body with a AAA flame maple veneer, delivering the classic tone and sustain that made the Genesis stand out in a crowd. The double cutaway body features 1-ply cream binding on the top for a beautiful vintage look. The mahogany neck has a 24.75\" scale with a 12\" radius and features a 1960s SlimTaper \"D\" profile--a player's favorite--along with a glued-in neck joint for lifelong stability. The rosewood fingerboard comes with pearloid trapezoid inlays, 22 medium-jumbo frets and a 1.68\" nut along with single ply cream binding along the fingerboard.Genesis Power: Epiphone ProBucker Humbuckers with Coil-TappingThe original Genesis model featured coil-tapping via a small mini toggle. However, the original Genesis did not allow for coil-tapping each individual pickup. The new Epiphone Ltd. Edition Genesis Deluxe PRO zooms into the 21st century with ProBucker pickups with coil-tapping on both the rhythm and lead pickups. ProBucker pickups feature Alnico II magnets, the same magnets used in sought-after vintage PAF humbuckers. Alnico II magnets provide a rich, warm tone with a sparkling high end and a solid low end. The Ltd. Edition Genesis Deluxe PRO features a ProBucker-2 in the neck position and a ProBucker-3 in the bridge position. The ProBucker-3 is slightly overwound to provide balance with the neck pickup with an added bit of edge for lead work. ProBuckers emulate the sound of original PAF pickups which were hand-wound with a few extra turns of wire.Both of the Ltd. Ed. Genesis PRO's pickups feature coil-tapping, which is activated by a push/pull volume SpeedKnob control, allowing players an infinite variety of pickups sounds from single-coil bark to full humbucker bite. When winding humbuckers, Epiphone utilizes a double vacuum waxing process that ensures quiet operation, free from microphonic hum. The pickup is first placed in the specialized wax vacuuming system before the cover is placed on the unit to ensure that the wax fully penetrates to the very center of the pickup and solidifies all parts. After the cover is placed on, it is again given a second vacuum wax bath until the unit is completely saturated with wax. Epiphone uses only the highest quality parts for its pickups, such as ABS plastic bobbins, 1010 Cold Rolled Steel pole shoes and pole screws, Alnico magnets and the finest magnet wire available.", "ItemID": "202570289636", "EndTime": "2019-01-24T05:33:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-19T05:33:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Limited-Edition-Genesis-Deluxe-PRO-Electric-Guitar-/202570289636", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Columbus, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025702896368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lyEAAOSwPVFcQrOX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~JIAAOSwZqlcQrPA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YwwAAOSwrAFcQrP5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/giAAAOSwkFZcQrPd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ye0AAOSwijhcQrR9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qOMAAOSw7F9cQrQw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6SUAAOSwFtNcQrRL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/B9sAAOSwRn1cQrSS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tpkAAOSwe~lcQrSz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pOEAAOSwqKNcQrTR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SPoAAOSwVoNcQ8JW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "43229", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "xbuyer2shop", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 646, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 240.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 240.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1114}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Limited Edition Genesis Deluxe PRO Electric Guitar ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}]}, "HitCount": 155, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 243.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very Good Condition on a scale from 1 to 10 , I would have to say she's a 9+  No cracks and No digs , very light scuffing from usual playing , No Gigging or Clubs of any kind !
