{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this Late 80s/Early 90s Japanese Charvel 475 Deluxe. I don't know the exact year.Serial No. 367792.It features a basswood body, rosewood fretboard w/ 22 frets and sharkfin inlays.I believe the name of this finish is 'Candy Blue,' but I could be wrong. More information on these models is here: http://www.charvelusa.com/charvel_models/charvel_1990_1991.html The tremolo has been replaced with a new Schaller Tremolo. I purchased and installed the tremolo about 3 months ago. It's one of the best feeling tremolos I've ever played so far. It's very durable and is built like a tank. It's smooth and flutters with ease. The original Charvel tremolo had to be replaced because it was worn out and no longer usable. I also upgraded it with a brass block. Pickups and electronics are original. I replaced the knobs with white - Fender style - knobs and switch tip.I will include the black metal knobs it came with when I bought it. But I don't believe they're the original ones.Sorry, I don't have the back trem. cover plate. This guitar, despite its age, is still very playable but it could use some work: Firstly, there are some divots on the first 5 or so frets. As well as a little bit of wear on the fretboard by those frets. The binding is a bit detached just below the nut and at the end after the 22nd fret (on both the treble and bass sides). Also a bit of binding missing from the headstock. But all of this is more of a cosmetic issue. There are several small dents/dings behind the neck, but not so bad that they'll hinder your playing.Small chip behind the tip of the headstock.Has the typical hairline crack on the finish of the neck joint (both sides). Several small chips on the finish of the body.More photos are available at the link below (copy and paste to your browser): https://imgur.com/a/rBSg5qi I do not have the case for this. But It'll be packed safely. Free shipping. Shipping within the US only.No sales tax will be added.
