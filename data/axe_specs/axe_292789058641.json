{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar belonged to my father in law. He was a musician from mid '60s til mid '80s. He played all over the world with this guitar. The guitar was bought new back then. Like i wrote in the description black is not the guitar's original color. He changed the color while still a performer. He is gone, long ago, i'm not a musician, nor anyone else in the family but i know that this guitar has some value. In a quick search with a second hand guitar shop in the UK, i've found out that it can get from 500-600 \u00a3. The guitar will be shipped within 48hrs from purchase. World wide shippment is included to the final price. I'm not an expert on guitars, so the listing's title, the guitar's type, is just an estimation. If you're gone buy it, i trust that you know which model you are buying.", "ItemID": "292789058641", "EndTime": "2018-11-02T13:36:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-26T13:36:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Hofner-Verythin-Semi-Hollow-Body-Electric-Guitar-Bigsby-Vintage-1964-/292789058641", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kaisariani", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2927890586418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDQ4OQ==/z/oc0AAOSwB8RbyTZQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDcxMA==/z/WHEAAOSwcBZbyTZb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQxWDk2MA==/z/jX0AAOSw0rBbyTZl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQwWDk2MA==/z/~z0AAOSwj81byTZw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ducatitifoso", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 92, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 666.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 666.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***n", "FeedbackPrivate": true, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 931}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Hofner Verythin Semi-Hollow Body Electric Guitar Bigsby Vintage (1964)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["H\u00f6fner"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 252, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "GR", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 676.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78616985", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 15, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Black is not the guitar's original color.
