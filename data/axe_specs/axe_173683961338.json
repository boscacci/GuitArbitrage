{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a Switch Vibracell Wild-IV Signature Electric Guitar in Black & Teardrop Green. The guitar is in excellent shape and plays/sounds amazing. It's loaded with a Cool Blue (Alnico 2) humbucking pickup in the neck position and a Stinger (Alnico 5) humbucking pickup in the bridge position. See more specs I swiped from the web below. I replaced the volume and tone knobs because the original knobs are a little retro looking on what is not even close to a retro body shape. I'll include the original knobs for those purists out there. Cosmetically, this guitar is in beautiful shape. There are no significant scratches or dents (see pics) in the finish, though the surface isn't completely smooth because of the weird one-piece composite molding process they use. This is my first non-wood guitar, and I admit the one-piece body/neck construction gives pretty good tone and sustain. Comes with and ships in a hardshell electric guitar case, which is in pretty good shape with the exception of a tear on one of the corners (sorry, no keys). The guitar has just been polished and restrung, so it's all ready to go. This is a fixed price listing, so $335.00 and it's yours! The guitar will be well-packed and insured. This item ships to Continental US only. Check out my other listings for more good deals. Good luck and thanks for looking! Vibracell technology Vibracell is a patented process of completely molding both electric and bass guitars including the neck and headstock, from the patented Switch Vibracell material creating an instrument with precise harmonic resonance and sound frequency. Vibracell allows the entire instrument to be created as a whole with complete control of neck, body weight and density by controlling the internal cells. With the ability to control the cells we can effectively tune the body and neck to exceed the characteristics and response of those instruments made from the best available woods in the world. Additionally, Vibracell has the pure strength to withstand extreme temperature changes that affect traditional wooden bodies and necks. The ability to control the cells density allows the neck to be formed with the body as one piece. Vibracell allows a true one piece neck-through design that eliminates the gluing of two half bodies to the neck. The one piece neck-thru body approach allows for energy to be transmitted through the entire body not only with extreme efficiency, but at a higher rate of speed ultimately delivering pure sustain and clarity. Vibracell technology allows the instrument to be created equally, time and time again without variances in sound due to the variances in wood.
