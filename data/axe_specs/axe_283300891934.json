{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar appears to be in new or almost new condition. There are a few very light surface scratches on it. When it was tested the bottom tone knob had some issues. First off, it will pull right out of the guitar, second, it is a knob that has 2 functions, it works in the bottom function but not in the top. Overall, this guitar plays and sounds great, all of the rest of the electronics work perfectly with no issues. This guitar does not come with anything not pictured. This is being sold as is and you fix it. Thanks for looking.
