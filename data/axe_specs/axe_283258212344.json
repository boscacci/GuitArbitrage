Will do my best. manf details: Riviera Custom P93The Epiphone Riviera Custom P93 is modeled after one of Epiphone\u2019s most enduring classics, the Riviera. First introduced in the early \u201860s, the Epiphone Riviera\u2019s semi-hollow design has been a favorite of players from all genres and generations including blues great Otis Rush, Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground, and The Strokes\u2019 Nick Valensi, who have all found that the Riviera\u2019s legendary ES-body shape could produce great tones with any pickup variation. Over the years, the Riviera has been seen with humbuckers, mini-humbuckers, and P-90s. But now the Custom P-93 has the rare distinction of giving players a new sound and a new distinctive look.The Riviera Custom P-93 uses 3 Epiphone \u201cDogear\u201d Alnico\u2122-V P-90 pickups for a punch that leaves all other three-single coil pickup guitars in the dust. And when matched with the bell-like tones of the ES-style body, a Bigsby\u00ae B700 tremelo, plus a stunning Metallic Gold finish with nickel hardware or a Wine Red finish with gold hardware, the Riviera Custom P93 truly becomes of our era\u2019s great instruments.
