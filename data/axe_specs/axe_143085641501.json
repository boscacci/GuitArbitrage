{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "EPIPHONE JAPAN Les Paul Standard LPS-80 1999 Goldtop MIJ fujigen Serial #: 906411 Up for sale this 1999 Epiphone Japan Les Paul Standard LPS-80! Goldtop finish w/1ply cream pickguard. MADE IN JAPAN. 1999 Fujigen manufacture. Mahogany body w/maple top, mahogany neck, and Gibson type open book headstock! Serial number on the headstock back. It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a couple of small finish chips and a few small marks and scratches on it here and there nothing that I found that I would call significantly major and overall I'd say that it's in fine shape! Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the neck, body, and headstock are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Has a bit of laminate outer varnish peel around the truss cover which has been nicely cured to prevent futher peel. Peel is only in the laminate outer varnish and does not affect the wood in any way. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds fantastic! Plenty of beefy attack, thick tone, and power! I found this one to be a great player and I must say this is an exceptionally excellent sounding Epiphone Les Paul! If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Comes w/Epiphone hardcase in fine functional condition. Shipping inside of the USA is $55 USD by USPS Priority Mail which is registered, insured and trackable. Please allow 2 to 3 days for delivery.
