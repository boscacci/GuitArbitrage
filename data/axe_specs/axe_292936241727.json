{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Excellent condition 2000 model year Gibson USA Les Paul Smart Wood exotic series. These were the start of Gibson using environmentally friendly woods in their guitar building. This has been fitted with Gibson Burstbucker 1 and 2 pickups. It plays fantastic and sounds amazing, and it won't break your back! The neck and back of the body are Forest Stewardship certified Mahogany as a real les paul should be, the fretboard is Curupay as discussed below I am not sure which earth friendly top wood this is but its one listed below (not Banera). Professionally set up and includes hard shell case. Please feel free to ask any questions. The SmartWood Exotic line (1996-2002), which was composed of six models. The SmartWood line featured tops made from different woods: Curupay has a deep chocolate-walnut richness; Peroba recalls the orangey hue of the old pine ceiling beam; Banara has a golden, banana-like glow; Ambay Guasu boasts the even lightness of maple; Taperyva Guasu is reminiscent of a sun-bleached rosewood, and Chancharana is a deep, warm-brown russet. The fretboards are all made from \"Curupay\" harvested from forests certified in accordance with the rules of the Forest Stewardship Council(FSC). The mahogany used in the construction of this model is from similarly certified forests. The SmartWood Exotic had a thinner, belly contoured, body than the Studio (somewhat similar to that of the Les Paul Custom Lite), and had \"smart wood\" written on the truss rod cover.[3]", "ItemID": "292936241727", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T01:22:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-27T19:32:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2000-Gibson-USA-Les-Paul-Smart-Wood-series-Burstbucker-1-and-2-pickups-/292936241727", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ladson, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929362417278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4OTM=/z/Ig0AAOSwXh9cRlCY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NDM=/z/A7sAAOSw7F9cRlCf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/bvwAAOSwhY9cRlCh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/TWYAAOSw259cRlCj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/lkoAAOSwylBcRlCm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/0MwAAOSwpRxcRlCn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29456", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "13engrsapper", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 338, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 368}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2000 Gibson USA Les Paul Smart Wood series with Burstbucker 1 and 2 pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany/and an exotic"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Smart Wood"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Fitted with Gibson Burstbucker 1 and 2 pickups."]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 97, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1050.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "excellent used condition - never broken", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
