{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a 1999 Epiphone G-400 (SG) Custom. I am not the original owner. I bought this last summer. I'm only selling because I discovered I'm more of a Fender guy. The guitar plays great and it sounds really amazing. The three hum buckers really sound really crunchy. You can get clean to overdrive tones out of them. With all three on at once it sounds really gnarly. The fretboard feels good and it has great action. Disclaimer: Dead fret on the 12th of the D string. Unsure where this damage is from. You can still get the note but you just have to press a bit harder than normal. Im not a luthier but this could probably be fixed with a fret level or something. The guitar looks very aged and worn. It has a great vintage aesthetic. It is definitely not in pristine condition but the wear is about average for a 20 year old guitar. I tried to include photos of all the major wear I saw. Disclaimer: cracks around headstock joint. This is the other issue I need to bring up. There are cracks around the neck joint that seem like more than just finish cracks. These were repaired before I purchased the guitar just by filling with glue and clamping the guitar. They have not opened up at all since I have owned it and the guitar stays in tune fine so I don't think its a problem. Overall this is a great guitar for a player or a collector. It definitely shows its age but that makes it exciting. Please message me with any questions or is you would like to see any more pictures.", "ItemID": "264163822438", "EndTime": "2019-01-26T15:17:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-25T17:17:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1999-Epiphone-G-400-Custom-Ivory-Electric-Guitar-/264163822438", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cumming, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641638224388080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n9sAAOSwfTlcQ4yy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eYUAAOSwUu5cQ4zH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jnAAAOSwolpcQ4z4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ss8AAOSwyApcQ40z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0bUAAOSwCXxcQ41J/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HhUAAOSwaaNcQ41b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L3IAAOSwc6ZcQ41n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YfUAAOSw2~NcQ43S/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j1wAAOSwolpcQ43e/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K-kAAOSwvcFcQ43~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xGUAAOSwMhVcQ44d/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tDAAAOSwKSlcQ444/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30040", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aarongreen.c9grhqi", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 86, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 202}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1999 Epiphone G-400 Custom Ivory Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["G-400"]}]}, "HitCount": 54, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 355.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
