{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "International sales will be considered. Message me. No returns. Exchange only. This is a very nice lp copy but there is a ever so slight back bow in the neck. It should straighten out when tension from strings is applied but if not it can easily be taken out through the heat method etc. it is so so slight. I discounted the price. But otherwise it's a very nice lp body and neck. Professionally made body and neck, ready for you to finish. I buy my wood from choice sources on ebay and this has a lightly flamed maple The Mahogany back is a solid one piece. This is NOT A VENEER. Rosewood fret board, This has a traditional one way truss rod. The top, back and sides still need a finish. You do that so I keep my cost down for you. I put a very thin lacquer coat on the top to seal and protect the maple.Things you will need to do are small finishing details, sanding etc. and drilling bridge holes, tailpiece holes, tuner mounts etc. I leave that to the customer to keep the cost down. However, I do offer additional services for a fee. 249.00 to locate/drill holes, mount tuners, cut nut, drill and install ground wire, check action. ( customer supplies his hardware). This will be a nice guitar when done( assuming you finish it well).
