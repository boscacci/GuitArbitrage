{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Used Washburn Ola Englund signature guitar. This is the predecessor to Ola's own Solar guitar brand which is very popular now. Flat black finish, Duncan Solar pickups, Grover tuners. In nice shape with no dings in the paint. The finish just above the strings where you rest your palm is a little shiny as is common with flat finishes. The only real issue is that the finish has very small cracks on the side of the neck near most of the frets. I tried to include a picture but it was difficult to capture. I think this is the type of minor quality control/materials issue that caused Ola to launch his own brand rather than stay with Washburn. Plays great, but could probably use new strings. Especially if you want to tune to standard as the strings on it now are heavier gauge. Gig bag pictured is included. Below is a promo video describing the guitar. He's showing the white version but this black model is pictured as well. https://youtu.be/m-jQAwvDGn8 Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "142994524105", "EndTime": "2018-11-06T00:08:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-30T07:59:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-Parallaxe-Ola-Englund-Solar-V-PX-SOLARV160-Guitar-/142994524105", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Englewood, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1429945241058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg4MTc=/z/-PAAAOSwjatbzs~Q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg3NDQ=/z/TmQAAOSwVoVbzs~R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fLQAAOSwPeVbzs~T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NjU=/z/mngAAOSwBgpbzs~T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eVwAAOSwPrtbzs~V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fP0AAOSwYCRbzs~W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8psAAOSwVRBbzs~a/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OFg3MjI=/z/Dk4AAOSwC0dbzs~b/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80113", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hitman632", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 251, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 189}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn Parallaxe Ola Englund Solar V PX-SOLARV160 Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["PXSOLARV160"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 221, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 405.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
