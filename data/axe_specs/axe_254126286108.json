{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Black 2004 Squier Standard Cyclone. This is a \"players guitar\" meaning it has the normal wear associated with a used instrument. There are a few scratches and scuffs, but nothing below the finish. There is also a discoloration on the fret-board under the high E string under the nut. This is just that, a light color to the wood of the finger-board. I have a graphtech nut but not set in in case buyer wants to change. Will also include set up graphtech string trees. Guitar also has GFS short brass block trem that just fit without altering guitar. It is basically blocked, but I dont use the trem anyway so not an issue. I will also include a set of Wilkinson EZ loc tuners that I was going to install. Frets in good shape with plenty of life and truss rod works as it shouldOriginal trem will be included with trem arms for both bridges Please review the photographs before bidding as they are a key part of the description. Some of the features;Maple neck24-3/4\" scale (Gibson scale)Rosewood fret-board22 medium-jumbo fretsSingle-coil neck pick-upHumbucker bridge pick-upOne tone, one volume3-way switchingSynchronized tremolo As with any electric guitar, it will need to be setup to your preferred playing style as everyone has their own comfort zone. As a used guitar it is being sold \"as is\" with no returns. Again, please review the photographs as a key part of the description before bidding.
