{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Telecaster is a rare Highway One 'Texas' model. Rare beautiful color too! Made in the USA. It was used for just a couple of years, and shows normal signs of wear, as highlighted in the pictures. Minimal fret wear. It comes with the original Fender gig bag in like-new condition. I\u2019m also including a cool black leather strap. Smoke-free home. If you're not familiar with the model, it was only made for a few years - this one in particular was manufactured in 2008 - with a mixture of modern and vintage features. Vintage-style tuners complement the headstock outline and, down at the other end of the strings, three brass saddles bring the guitar into line with what is usually regarded as the definitive Telecaster specification. Hot vintage pickups, a modern 12-inch fingerboard radius, jumbo frets and Fender's new Greasebucket tone circuit provide subtle deviations that don't interfere with the aesthetic identity of the instrument, but have a strong impact on its feel and tone. Thanks for your interest!", "ItemID": "332997929739", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T21:52:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T16:00:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-Highway-One-Texas-/332997929739", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Troy, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329979297398080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eoEAAOSwxL5cMM4~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/82YAAOSwQBBcMM4x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9cMAAOSwFoNcMM4r/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ljEAAOSwy6NcMM4z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/W5EAAOSwxtVcMM4v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M~IAAOSwMg5cMM4t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ABoAAOSw5cZcMM5B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/D5IAAOSwj91cMM41/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kvgAAOSwDsZcMM4o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b90AAOSw1IhcMM49/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ffoAAOSwYV5cMM47/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dbAAAOSwvfpcMM44/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48083", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "simone.bonino", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 135, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 54}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster Highway One Texas", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2008"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Highway One"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Honey Blonde"]}]}, "HitCount": 248, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
