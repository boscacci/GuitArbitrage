{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this 2006 mint condition American Deluxe Stratocaster To start with, this guitar is in a flawless Honey Blond finish, in almost the same condition as it was when it was shipped from final assembly Corona, CA. There are no scratches, swirls, mars, dent's, dings, or chips in this flawless Honey Blond finish. You can see for yourself from the reflections of the contoured body images how clean and perfect the finish is. If you look closely, on one of the back side images, you can clearly see the reflection of my hand holding the camera to take the picture. Everything on this guitar is original equipment. The pick guard is heavy gauge beveled Copper vinyl. The controls and pickups are white. Standard is the Fender 5 way pick up selector switch. However on this guitar, the volume knob also serves as the push in S-1 Switch, which gives you even more tone selections than just the standard pickup selection and tone knob settings. The pickups are Samarian Cobalt Noiseless (SCN) pick ups. The bridge is the fully adjustable solid metal bridge sections model as are used on the current American Elite series of Stratocasters, with a pop in whammy bar and 2 point tremolo tailpiece. The particular guitar has a 9.5\" radius mild V shape adjustable maple neck with rolled edges, highly detailed and finished medium frets and a beautifully aged Maple fingerboard with Abalone dot fret marker inlays. There is absolutely no fret wear. Up top, the tuning gears are polished locking machines. It has a 60th Anniversary medallion on the back side of the head stock to signify it's manufacture in the 60th year of Fender Guitars. This guitar comes complete with Tremolo bar, Strap Locks, Polishing Cloth, Neck, Bridge and heel Allen Adjusting wrenches, Warranty Card and Users Manual. Additionally there's an S-1 Switching diagram, decals,and hangers, and of course it's in the original Hard Shell Tolex G&G presentation case with 1 key. I cannot repeat this often enough. This guitar is in perfect condition!
