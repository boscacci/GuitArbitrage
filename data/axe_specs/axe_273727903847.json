{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "ltd m 300 with kahler x trem and emg pssive hz's. Condition is Used. Up for bid is a nice guitar ,in nice shape without many scratches or dents please look at pics. What is really cool about the item is the Kahler x trem with whammy bar . The tremolo is very well designed, and works great. All the electronics seem to work. It has a 3 way switch with volume and tone control over the 2 emg hz passive pick ups, a great metal machine. the finish is charcoal grey with a flame maple top coming thru. The neck has a cream binding, also this was made in Korea, I am guessing early to middle 2000's. The strings are old and would need to be replaced. I bought this off of Ebay some 5 years ago and have barely played it. This item comes with no gig bag, but is well packed. I have a lot of guitars and need to sell to pay for another E bay guitar purchase. You will not regret buying this guitar, if you do not like it you can return it . I only ship to the lower 48 us states.
