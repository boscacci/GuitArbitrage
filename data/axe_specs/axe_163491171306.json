{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Older fender telecaster made in Japan . Serial # is E854433. Just to be perfectly clear I\u2019m no guitar expert. I can play chords mostly. I no longer have an amp to play it through but it sounded really nice when I had one . I mostly just mess around on an acoustic. Also this guitar has dings and scratches. Typical of the age I guess but this is more of a player guitar vs a collectible. I know the guitar worked fine for me but as far as how good the pickups and how the condition is I have no idea. It works but like I said I\u2019m no expert. Ask any questions and I\u2019ll try to answer my best . Check out the pics and if you need more pics just message . It has a soft prs case with back straps. Provides good padding but it\u2019s not hard so I will wrap it in bubble wrap and box it up for shipping. Shipping to USA only I don\u2019t want to mess with international problems that might occur. Again ask questions it\u2019s sold as is. As for the shipping charge I have no idea how much it is . I will refund any difference from the actual cost .", "ItemID": "163491171306", "EndTime": "2019-01-24T00:14:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-17T00:14:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Older-Fender-Telecaster-Japan-/163491171306", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Warner, New Hampshire", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634911713068080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3FQAAOSwip5cP8JI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zwEAAOSwI-tcP8JJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ei4AAOSwYPNcP8JN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6V4AAOSwlfNcP8JD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aj0AAOSwIbtcP8JW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HwsAAOSwOKxcP8JY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n8wAAOSw5wJcP8JP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7kMAAOSwBVdcP8JS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WKIAAOSw5bxcP8JT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/faIAAOSwc9VcP8JF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Zs8AAOSwDmxcP8JH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VuUAAOSw1jpcP8JL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "03278", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sparkydoodooballs", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1529, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 50, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 219}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Older Fender Telecaster Japan ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 1342, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 460.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
