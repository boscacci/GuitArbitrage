{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Shipping to the lower 48 states. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement. I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Strat\". The Squier maple neck has near zero fret wear ,and has had a nice headstock make over with many coats of clear over the decal. I replaced the closed back tuners with some nice vintage looking Kluson style tuners.There is a small nick in the edge of the fretboard at about the sixth fret. The very cool aftermarket Gloss Tar Heel Blue Body looks very nice,just mild surface scratches. The bridge pickup has been upgraded with a white humbucker,the middle and neck pickups are Squier Affinity Series single coil pickups. The guitar has been wired for tone control on all three pickups.The bridge and neck pickups both work with the neck pickups tone control. Nice to have tone control on the bridge pickup,makes it a lot more versatile. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The capacitor has been upgraded with a .033 Axial film capacitor . More range of tone control and a smoother response. I added the Black pickguard, black rear tremolo cover,and white volume and tone knobs,switch tip and whammy bar tip to complete the modern juju vibe I was going for. This guitar sounds really good,and it looks like a classic. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
