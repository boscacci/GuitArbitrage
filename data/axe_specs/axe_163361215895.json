{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You are looking at the best Tele I ever owned. Including a USA Standard. Only selling because I need the cash unfortunately.It has been modded with a prewired pick guard and control plate with electronics from 920D. Pickups are Dimarzio Area T noiseless. They really sound authentic. The control plate is much thicker than the original. I opted for the black guard original was mint green. About 200.00 for the upgrade.I did sell the original pick guard and control plate for about 75.00I also replaced the threaded saddles with Fender compensated brass. This really changed the tone to warmer and made the playability better. I will include the original saddles with the guitar.It really plays well up and down the neck, stays in tune great and is very resonant unplugged. It is just ready to go.The flaws: As you can see in the pics there is a gouge at the bottom back of the body. It was there when I purchased it.You can't see it from the front. Standard pick scratches etc.Guitar comes with the standard Fender gig bag when new not pictured.I see there are not many of these for sale. This is a good one. Please ask any questions. Priced to sell and thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "163361215895", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T01:16:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-08T05:40:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Classic-Series-60-s-Telecaster-w-Dimarzio-Area-T-Pickups-/163361215895", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Lansing, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633612158958080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/s9UAAOSwBYFb2olE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/YoEAAOSwDAdb2olP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/k~gAAOSwEf5b2olb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/dOMAAOSwSe5b2olm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/LsYAAOSw44db2oly/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/W5cAAOSwEcxb2ol-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/KUQAAOSwE4tb2omL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/2ZEAAOSwhnlb2omX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/W-MAAOSwQuZb2omj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/lCEAAOSw5Qtb2om5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/QMIAAOSwRK9b2onE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48911", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jldelta2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 197, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 92.9}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 222}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Classic Series 60\u2019s Telecaster w/Dimarzio Area T Pickups!\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Classic Series"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Classic Series 60's"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Dimarzio Area T"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Olympic White"]}]}, "HitCount": 97, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
