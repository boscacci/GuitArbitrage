{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I bought this guitar used and I don\u2019t know much about it other than it screams. I believe it\u2019s got a Seymour Duncan JB in it. Sounds like a JB. I used it as a gig guitar and it screams no doubt ! The neck is maple and the action is great . I don\u2019t know what the body wood is. This guitar plays really well and there\u2019s a bigger brass block in it which probably adds to its great sustain . It\u2019s got Planet Waves tuners that it came with as well as the EVH d-tune which I\u2019ve never used . The bridge is set up floating right now as I prefer the flexibility of both directions when using a term bar. It does have a Floyd Rose and there\u2019s no issue there either. If you\u2019re looking for a fun guitar that doesn\u2019t require worry and totally screams you won\u2019t be disappointed . Comes with a Fender gig bag and will be shipped professionally . Feel free to ask questions . I\u2019m only offering to ship this guitar within USA . Foreign bidders will need a USA shipping address.", "ItemID": "163344992107", "EndTime": "2018-11-06T17:03:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-30T17:03:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Charvel-single-pickup-screamer-Slime-Green-/163344992107", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Beverly Hills, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633449921078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/44kAAOSwHjtb2Ilh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y1IAAOSw9z1b2ImC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MAQAAOSwq6Nb2ImE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SzUAAOSwDOpb2ImD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b24AAOSwsz9b2ImA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bzkAAOSww7tb2ImD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y0kAAOSw8sBb2ImG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VJwAAOSwj6lb2ImC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34465", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "luapidnic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 666, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 94.7}, "BidCount": 10, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 290.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 290.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "4***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 50}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Charvel single pickup screamer Slime Green !!\ud83d\ude0e", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}]}, "HitCount": 866, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
