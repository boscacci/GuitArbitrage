{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a Squier Affinity Series Telecaster in Arctic White. Many Fender upgrades have been made to make this thing a real player! The pickups (Neck and bridge) have been replaced with Fender Tex-Mex pickups, the pickguard has been replaced with a Mint colored tele pickguard, Fender neck plate, switchcraft jack, and a Fender Telecaster restoration headstock decal has been applied. The Frets have been leveled and crowned and the setup is spot on. A real player! Please ask all question before bidding. See ALL photos. Paypal only.

You probably already know this, but wanted to state it anyway. 2) When I replaced the jack (to a switchcraft), I changed out the plastic jack plate with an old metal one I had laying around. Please see photo. I assure you that the jack is tight and works perfectly, but there were holes left from the previous jack plate. I didn't have time to replace with a better jack plate. It is something you could leave as is or switch out for $5 on your own.
