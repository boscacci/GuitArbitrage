{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a \"Serviceman's Special\" Stratocaster! It's a full on forgery of a Fender Strat made in the far east! These were produced from the 1960's through the 1980's to be sold to visiting servicemen.Now they are very collectible. This one actually plays and sounds ok!The guitar comes in an after-market gig bag! The case in the pictures is not included. Info from the web:\"Serviceman's Guitars\" were unauthorized forgeries (complete with logo) made in the Philippines from the 1960s through the 1980s, and sold to American GIs (and visiting forces from other countries) stationed there during that time. Thousands of these came to the states with the returning GI, and still today pop up in pawn shops, yard sales, and eBay. They were of dubious quality, but are somewhat fascinating due to the sheer number of models rudementarily copied with amazing detail... often by a single guy inside his tiny factory/store/home using pictures from a catalog. During their heyday, virtually all popular models of American guitars were offered, both Fender and Gibson. They typically sold new from $75 - $100, depending on what kind of deal one could barter on any given day. Play it or display it! Either way is awesome!
