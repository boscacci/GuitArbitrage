{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1977 Greco \"Lawsuit\" Les Paul Standard type Guitar-(Has the Lawsuit Moustache Headstock) Made in Japan - It's seen plenty of use and has lots of dings, scratches, etc... Most noticeable would be that much of the finish is gone on the back of the neck - and there is one crack in the Top- Extends from Neck Pickup ring toward the Cutaway about 3/4 INch- It's been glued but is still noticeable - Also there are several places along the edges that are worn through - The Tuners are nice 70's nickel USA Grovers with Keystone buttons! and the neck position pickup has been changed to a Gibson P94, which sounds great! The bridge is the humbucker that came with it when I got it- I swapped out the magnet to an un-oriented Alnico 5 and it's pretty darned spanky! The toggle is changed to a switchcraft and the pots are CTS and Alpha I installed with orange drop caps for the tone controls- The input jack is also upgraded to a switchcraft. NOTE: This is One of the Japanese Greco's That besides having Gibson's Headstock shape, it also has the Gibson Style Truss Rod System and Rosewood Fingerboard! It's a Nice Neck!!! It's a semi hollow design and weighs in at 8.5 lbs. according to my bathroom scale This guitar plays really nice- Straight Neck with Recently Dressed frets that are smooth and play wonderfully - Action is set pretty low and she plays quick and nice all the way up the fretboard- No dead spots- She's a rocker!!! I was going to change out the nut and switch out the bridge to an ABR-1 to widen out the string spread a bit, to match up to the pickups poles better, but I didn't - Iit plays real nice with the original 'Bone' nut and original bridge- So I've just left it- Also it needs Strap Holders!!!... Them there's the 'Project\" part for the new owner..... and if you cared to refinish it or what not- Comes with a nice 4 latch Arched top lid Epiphone Hardshell Case- Really Nice Case!!! it's a bit larger than a les paul case- (I think it may be an ES-339 Case...???) Nice vintage Japanese Lawsuit era Les Paul- I'm sure I will miss her......... Sold absolutely \"AS-IS\" No Returns!!!!! $65.00 Shipping for Extremely well packed Delivery in the upper 48 States - USA Shipping ONLY.....", "ItemID": "273674156482", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T03:11:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-27T03:11:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1977-Greco-Les-Paul-Standard-Guitar-Lawsuit-Gibson-P94-Nice-Playing-Project-/273674156482", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Santa Monica, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736741564828080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nKsAAOSwXIdcOmDP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NjE=/z/oJgAAOSw7F9cOmCq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODI=/z/F4IAAOSwNXpcOmC2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5Njk=/z/DAQAAOSwG49cOmC8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NTc=/z/OJIAAOSw-rxcOmCj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NTI=/z/sBsAAOSwQZdcOmCx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uQsAAOSwH2VcOmC8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5Mzg=/z/z1YAAOSwuwlcOmCX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDc1/z/j~gAAOSwpRxcOmCy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1NlgxNjAw/z/cOMAAOSwQZVcOmDF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODgzWDE2MDA=/z/tmQAAOSwXF5cOmDD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA0OFgxNjAw/z/CW4AAOSwjJ9cOmDM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "booboojanisch", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1144, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 485.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 485.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 12}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1977 Greco Les Paul Standard Guitar-\"Lawsuit\" Gibson P94- Nice Playing Project!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple top/Mahogany back"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Greco"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1979"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["EG-800CR"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Les Paul  type"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst type"]}]}, "HitCount": 831, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 490.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
