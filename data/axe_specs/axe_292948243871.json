{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "STORAGE UNIT FIND ABOUT A YEAR AGO. LOOKS LIKE THE REAL DEAL ABOUT A 1965 OR MID 60'S GIBSON SG IN THE ORIGINAL CASE..WHO KNOWS WHAT THE GUY WAS TRYING TO DO TO THIS OLD CLASSIC BUT HE SURE DIDN'T DO IT ANY FAVORS WHEN HE \"REFINISHED\" IT. THE NECK LIKE SO MANY OF THE EARLY SG VARIATIONS SUFFERED A BREAK AND A REPAIR...NOT A GREAT REPAIR AT THAT BUT PROBABLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME BEING BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY A TALENTED PROFESSIONAL LOOKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL CHERRY RED WAS STRIPPED OFF IN FAVOR OF THE NAKED MAHOGANY WITH SOME KIND OF CLEAR OVER THE TOP. THE SERIAL NUMBER IS ALL BUT GONE BUT THERE ARE STILL WHISPERS OF OF THE NUMBERS ON THE HEADSTOCK.LOOKS LIKE THE WIRES WERE CUT TO STRIP IT DOWN COMPLETELY AND THEN HE COULDN'T GET IT BACK TO A WORKING STATE AGAIN. PICK GUARD, MAESTRO VIBRATO COVER, BACK COVER FOR THE POTS ARE PRESENT AND SERVICEABLE AS WELL AS WHAT LOOKS TO BE THE ORIGINAL HUMBUCKERS MARKED PATENT NO 2.737.842...THEY WILL NEED REDONE. ORIGINAL TUNERS ARE LONG GONE...THERE IS NO NUT OR PICK UP SURROUNDS NO SCREWS EITHER...I'D BET THERE WAS ANOTHER BAG WITH THOSE PARTS THAT JUST GOT SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE PARTS AND PIECES...BUT ANYWAY... I HAVE ENOUGH TO WORK ON AND WILL LET THIS GO TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER IN THIS 7 DAY AUCTION. THE OPENING BID IS REASONABLE AT 500.00...ASK QUESTIONS AND i WILL ANSWER TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THIS WEIGHS IN AT JUST OVER 6 POUNDS WITH THE PICK UPS, BACK COVER,PICK GUARD, MAESTRO COVER ON THE SCALE WITH THE GUITAR. THIS IS OR WAS NOT MY GUITAR SO I KNOW NOTHING OF THE ORIGINALITY OR AUTHENTICITY OF THIS GIBSON GUITAR. BUT I HAVE HAD SOME VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE MUSIC STORE AND LUTHIER AND GUITAR TECHNICIANS GIVE THEIR OPINION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS LOOKS TO BE AN AUTHENTIC VINTAGE 1960'S GIBSON SG THE CONSENSUS IS THAT IT IS AND IT NEEDS AN OWNER TO DO IT RIGHT...SO DON'T HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS...THERE ARE NO RETURNS ON THIS ITEM.
