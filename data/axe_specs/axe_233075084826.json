These have a 3 piece maple neck which eliminates the problem with gibson headstock/neck breaksSlab Mahogany body some buckle rash on back, checking in finish, chips in paint. theres no cracks in the neck Gibson Classic 57 and 57plus pickups installed and work really well in this guitar Sounds like a mix between an ES-335 (look up the Es-335 Classic 57 Combo) and an SG! You get lots of sparkle and Brightness with the tone knob cranked roll it back and you get a beautiful fat tone that is not too dark very usable. In the neck position it puts out a beautiful Jazz tone with the tone rolled back and played through clean channel. Great balance between bridge and neck pickups. Then it gets this incredible honk tone.
