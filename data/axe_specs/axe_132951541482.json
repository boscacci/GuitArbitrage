{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Guild is pleased to announce the highly anticipated reintroduction of one of its most iconic, uniquely recognizable guitars: the S-200 Thunderbird. This reissue is a replica of the original versions produced between 1964 and 1968, featuring an asymmetrical all mahogany body sure to catch the eye of the guitarist looking to blaze his or her own trail. However, this guitar\u2019s appeal isn\u2019t just about its looks \u2013 its unique controls create the widest array of tones offered on any Guild instrument, drawing on its dual Guild LB-1 Little Bucker pickups to achieve almost every conceivable color on the palette. The T-Bird features a vintage C-shaped set mahogany neck and bound fingerboard with pearloid block inlays. Other period-correct details include open gear vintage tuning machines, and famed asymmetrical headstock adorned with Guild\u2019s logo and mother-of-pearl Thunderbird icon. Condition: This killer guitar is in excellent condition and has been professionally inspected and setup to play great. The only notable physical blemishes are a scuff on the corner of the headstock (see close-up) and some light surface scratches. Includes deluxe padded gig bag with backpack-style shoulder straps.
