{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello folks! Up for sale is a very hard to find Fender Pawn Shop Mustang Bass reissue. Fender didn\u2019t manufacture these short scale basses for very long, so they are pretty scarce. This item is in great condition, barely played, with only a very few minor dings/scratches. I had this bass fitted with a Double pole triple throw switch. (See pic) I also put 2 tele knobs on the volume and tone controls, the originals will be included. ALSO INCLUDED is a set of hipshot bass tuning machine replacements. (not responsible if the tuners don\u2019t fit, told they were exact replacements.) Original gig bag is included. Will ship FedEx to lower 48 only, no international orders. Signature will be required upon delivery. PayPal only. If you have any questions, feel free to message me. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "253920072523", "EndTime": "2019-01-16T23:24:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-06T19:17:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Pawn-Shop-Mustang-Bass-Reissue-/253920072523", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Santa Rosa Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2539200725238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8YkAAOSwYNlbuQZY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IAYAAOSwclVbuQZK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xoIAAOSwAWtbuQZW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/29YAAOSwnz9buQZS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GmsAAOSwOwpbuQZI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i9QAAOSwBHJbuQZU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mIIAAOSwdHxbuQZQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o5sAAOSwjq9buQZP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VwAAAOSwxOVbuQZN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LEoAAOSwHTlbuQZL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32459", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kinggeorgesurginer2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 437, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 725.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 725.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 118}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Pawn Shop Mustang Bass Reissue", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}]}, "HitCount": 2126, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
