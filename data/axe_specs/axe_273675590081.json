{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Rare Discontinued Agile PS-900 (PRS Style) Electric Guitar. Condition is Used. Bought this one a long time ago before the PRS really became prevalent, and before the PRS/Gibson lawsuit timeframe. This is a PRS copy style guitar, and was discontinued around the same time of the lawsuits going on. Not sure of the exact scale length on this one, but feels like shorter side like Gibson as opposed to the PRS scale. Plays like butter. This one has some upgrades on it. It has a set of passive EMG pickups with matching black knobs and toggle switch. Some running off of the black on the pickup rings, but no other issues on this one. Great condition and has lived most of its life hanging in the studio. Clearing out some of the collection, so don\u2019t hesitate on this one. Haven\u2019t seen this model pop up in a very long time! Happy to answer any questions or provide additional info you\u2019d like! Good luck bidding! EDIT: Revised descripting. Looks like Rondo Music is selling these again, so perhaps they won the legal battle with PRS! Appears they are selling now at a higher price of $289 + shipping. Here's your chance to pick one up a bit cheaper with an awesome pickup combo and hardware upgrade already done for you! On Jan-31-19 at 13:43:26 PST, seller added the following information: EDIT 2: After some research, it appears from googling (not confirmed or guaranteed by me!) that the pickup set in the guitar are active EMG's, the neck being an 81 ($100 on EMG site) and the bridge being an 89 ($120 on EMG site). Source: 81 = silver 85 = gold 89 = red 60 = blue With that said, if guitar doesn't sell this time around, I may keep it and just pull the pickups for a different guitar build-out.
