On Dec-06-18 at 11:01:51 PST, seller added the following information: There is remains of a paper sticker on the key head that has been partially removed. I don't know what was on this sticker, it might have been attached by the retail store. I could have removed it with a damp cloth, but decided to leave it alone. There is no serial number on the guitar, just patent numbers as can be seen in the picture.", "ItemID": "292847354078", "EndTime": "2018-12-11T02:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-04T02:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Classic-Fury-bass-guitar-maple-wood-Slightly-used-/292847354078", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Diego, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928473540788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk3/z/bPAAAOSwSn1cBZrT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk3/z/qHMAAOSwukZcBZsN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk3/z/fdsAAOSwXWhcBZt4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5N1gxNjAw/z/Pb8AAOSwnhlcBZtV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5N1gxNjAw/z/QjYAAOSwB19cCXD~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92129", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mewaha", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 208, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 148.47, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 148.47, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 17}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey Classic Fury bass guitar, maple wood. \u00a0Slightly used, . \u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maplewood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Fury"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Classical"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blond"]}]}, "HitCount": 163, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 150.97, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
