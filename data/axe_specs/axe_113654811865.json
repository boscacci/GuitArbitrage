{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Thanks for viewing my listing! This is a 1971 Gibson SG Standard that I purchased many years ago. It was fully disassembled and I never got around to getting it back together. As can be seen, it was routed for a Kahler trem. This was done via cutting the trem block so it would fit. I purchased a chrome one as a donor with the intent of replacing it. The neck is straight and the trussrod works. The frets are original and will need to be replaced as they are extremely low. I have two pickguards, not sure which one was on it when I bought it. I will be including a 496R/500T pickup set and all parts shown in the pictures. The original harness will be included but will need to be replaced (it was scratchy if I recall) - Pot codes are 1377114 - 14th week of 1971. No idea what tuners were on it but I'll probably include some Klusons if I can find some, but assume that there will be no tuners. The guitar was working fine when I disassembled it and can be reassembled with what I provide. A custom plate to cover the trem hole/springs was fabricated for it. It was a cool guitar when I bought it. There is a finish crack in the neck joint by the screw, at least it appears to just be the finish as there's nothing on the other side. I was going to keep it with a chrome Kahler, custom harness and such - but if you are adept at old guitar wood, it could be blocked and brought back to original. It had a Lyre on it originally. I have more pictures, ask if you are interested for something in particular. Will ship securely in a gig-bag.

Thanks again for viewing my listing!On Feb-20-19 at 22:13:22 PST, seller added the following information: Thanks for all of the questions folks - I wanted to add a link, shown below. I've been an AC/DC fan since Pop-rocks and Panasonic boom boxes blasting Back in Black.. I bought this guitar as I am of the opinion that Angus's first SG was a 71. If true, this guitar was built by the same guys/gals on the same line and likely this is as close as you can get. Check out the link, the second pic from 72 - that picture is the reason I purchased this guitar a decade ago. It's the same guitar - If you want to build a real-deal Angus clone/tribute, this is the shell to start with :) 71 SG InfoOn Feb-21-19 at 09:05:10 PST, seller added the following information: Also - since I didn't include any pics in this spot, there are no breaks in the headstock/neck joint area. Other than the route for the trem it's pretty much unmodified.On Feb-24-19 at 17:03:26 PST, seller added the following information: I have a pic of what it looks like under the Kahler nut for folks that would like to see it, just message me with the request. Nothing funky, just the stock nut removed and the two holes from the Kahler nut.", "ItemID": "113654811865", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T20:50:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-19T20:50:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Gibson-SG-Standard-1971-Project-Repair-Fix-/113654811865", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Concord, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136548118658080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/z8cAAOSwcwdcbGnE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LQgAAOSwWnhcbGpJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wiwAAOSwM6VcbGpC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dfYAAOSw1vxcbGpY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NegAAOSwBRlcbGnU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/z-gAAOSwcwdcbGnW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-~AAAOSw4ylcbGoj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FE0AAOSwJgBcbGnd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nd0AAOSw94NcbGol/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Kk8AAOSwYNdcbGon/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/frEAAOSwnwpcbGop/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FNEAAOSwTGNcbGp7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "94521", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pivard", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1384, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 55, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 677.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 677.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "8***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 53}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Gibson SG Standard 1971 Project Repair Fix ", "HitCount": 3238, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "118985", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118985", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=3455840", "StoreName": "Dynabyte s Depot"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 687.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
