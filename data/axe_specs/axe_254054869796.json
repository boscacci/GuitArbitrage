Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Strat\". The Squier maple/rosewood neck has near zero fret wear , and has had a nice headstock make over with many coats of clear over the decal. The very cool Black/Silver Metallic Sunburst Body looks very nice, only the mildest of surface scratches. The guitar features an HMV humbucker in the bridge position and two ceramic single coils in the neck and middle positions. The guitar has been wired for tone control on all three pickups.The bridge and neck pickups both work with the neck pickups tone control. Nice to have tone control on the bridge pickup,makes it a lot more versatile. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The capacitor has been upgraded with a .022uf polyester film capacitor . More range of tone control and a smoother response. This guitar sounds really good,and it looks super cool.
