{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 2018 Eric Johnson Signature White Stratocaster. It is electronically stock and is in almost mint condition. It has a few tiny dings that I could not get to come through on pictures but it is in excellent condition and frets are flawless with basically no wear. It comes with a very nice hardshell case. The pictures do not remotely do this guitar justice, it is amazing in person. Nice flame on neck and body with Nitro finish is incredible. Eric Johnson believes that guitars sound better without back cover on cavity. That is how this guitar comes new with no holes drilled for cover. This is a two piece alder body and is made in America. This guitar has every upgrade I would ever think of putting on a Strat and it is all stock. Nitro finish, vintage large tremolo block, vintage saddles, 12\" radius neck, locking tuners, etc.. It is set up for 10's with very low action, intonation is spot on and it plays like a dream. The tuners are not stock on this guitar. The tuners on it are Genuine Fender Locking Tuners (huge improvement over stock ones imho. These are the tuners they put on American Deluxe Strats. It will not come with stock tuners). These locking tuners are a must on all my Strats. They are easily the quality of Sperzels. Tuning stability and tone are second to none with this guitar. Most amazing neck I have ever played. I hate to sell this one as I know I will have sellers remorse. The Eric Johnson stock pickups are stunning, they have clarity but are very warm. I have owned American Stratocasters in the past and the quality of this guitar makes them look like toys. The huge vintage trem block makes a huge difference tone wise. Eric Johnson knows tone for sure. I only ship to the USA. Shipping will be $30.00. Guitar will ship as soon as payment is received. Please check my feedback and bid with confidence.
