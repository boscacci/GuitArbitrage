{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful guitar. Plays and sounds fantastic! Tuning stays locked and after spending the initial time, you wont need to touch it for probably the life of the strings. I bought this guitar used a few years ago and just find myself hardly playing it as it doesn't fit my style. Strings need replaced but I will leave them on for shipping to avoid temp/humidity running wild on the neck. Comes with ESP form fit hard case. I used fabric freshening stuff and the fabric on the inside looks a little spotty now, but nothing wrong with it and it smells good! Also includes whammy bar and allen wrenches in case.
