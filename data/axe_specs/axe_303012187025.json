{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2007 Ibanez JEM7V Electric Guitar White Jem Series Steve Vai JEM7VWH w/ OHSC Click Photos to Enlarge Description Make/Model: Ibanez Jem 7V Year: 2007 Serial Number: F0704134 Location of Manufacture: Japan Scale Length: 25.5\" Nut Width: 1-11/16\" Weight: 7.55 lbs Finish Color: White Pickup/Control Layout: DiMarzio HSH pickup configuration w/ vol & tone controls + 5-way selector switch Neck Wood: Multi-laminate maple w/ walnut Fingerboard Wood: Rosewood Case: Original Ibanez Team J Craft Prestige Case in excellent shape; some scuffs on the exterior but the interior is super nice and very plush! Features: Gold hardware, Gotoh tuners, Ibanez locking bridge w/ whammy bar, scalloped frets 21-24, \"tree of life\" inlay on 24-fret bolt-on neck. Condition: This guitar is in very good shape overall! There's a few small chips in the finish here and there along the sides/edges (see pics), one or two small dings/dents, and some light scratches & scuffs that you'd associate with normal, honest playwear. The middle pickup cover and both knobs have yellowed a bit with age. The back of the neck feels absolutely fantastic in my hands; no dings or dents here. The headstock may have some light scratches, but like the body they are pretty subtle against the white finish. The fretboard looks excellent with just a few very light scratches, and there's only a hint of fretwear in the first few positions. The neck is straight, the action is spot on, and with a fresh set of strings this guitar has been set up to rock! All electronics have been tested and are in working condition. Everything pictured is ready to be professionally packed and shipped. Comments: I was honestly a little surprised how well this guitar setup: it really lives up to the Team J Craft reputation! Very low action that's both fast and comfortable, and the scalloped frets on the upper end is just the icing on the cake. With the HSH DiMarzio pickups, it's hard to find a bad sound inside this guitar. Extraordinarily playable, and with the classic Jem looks we've all come to know and love! No disappointments here, this guitar will make anyone -- Steve Vai fan or not -- extremely happy!12122018-06 NK2 All items shipped are fully insured.
