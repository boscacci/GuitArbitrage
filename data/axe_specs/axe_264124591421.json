{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The Kramer Assault 220 FR A Singlecut Shred Weapon High-octane shred axes traditionally tend toward the offset-double-cutaway body designs or updates on the classic V and Explorer shapes. However, plenty of players would love to put the timeless single cut style rock weapon through the high-speed, high-gain paces. Enter Kramer\u2019s Assault 220 and Assault 220FR. Both are designed with the classic Maple-Mahogany tonewood combination and single-cutaway styling, but updated with a sharper body horn, glued-in Mahogany neck, and a shred-certified 25-1/2\u201d scale length. The Assault 220 are thinner and lighter than most single cutaways. These models are loaded with firepower with a pair of high-output Alnico V humbucker pickups with a push/pull tone control to series/parallel tap the neck pickup. They're finished off with contemporary high-performance hardware. And, the Assault 220 FR features a licensed Floyd Rose vibrato with locking tuning system for deep-divebombing action. For speed, lead, crunch and chunk, as well for all your sweeter, mellower moments, the impressively versatile Assault 220FR is the only weapons you will need.

The ones on there work fine so I never got around to changing them out. The guitar is set up for light gauge 9s. Insurance will be placed on this item and signature is required for delivery.
