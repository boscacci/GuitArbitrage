The latest incarnation of a truly timeless classic, it rings more fully, brightly and crisply than ever. The look, sound and vibe of the Telecaster resonates throughout the history of popular music. From orchestra pits to mosh pits, small clubs to stadiums and garages to recording studios, its signature sound is everywhere. The American Standard Telecaster Electric Guitar with Maple Fingerboard has hand-rolled fingerboard edges, Custom Shop pickups, staggered tuning machines, improved bridge with bent steel saddles mounted to a stamped-brass bridge plate for increased resonance and sustain, tinted neck, high-gloss maple fingerboard, satin-finished neck back, thinner finish undercoat that lets the body breathe and improves resonance, and Fender Tolex case.
