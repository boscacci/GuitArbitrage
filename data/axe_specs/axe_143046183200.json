{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ibanez JEM Jr. JEM555WH Evolutions, gold hardware, 1996 Korean This is a great guitar and I really like it, especially with the upgrades I made to it. Why sell it? I bought a Universe UV777BK (black w/binding, pyramids, and mirror pickguard) and decided to find a JEM in the same color combination (JEM77VBK), so the white & gold JEM Jr. has to go. This JEM Jr. (JEM555WH- vine/ dot inlay, White, American Basswood body) is from the third year of production in Korea and has the \"STEVE VAI\" inlay at the 24th fret. It also has an \"S\" stamped on the back of the head stock, likely \"seconded\" for some small imperfection. Many will agree that 1990\u2019s Korean production is superior to the current bargain JEM JR. seen in big box stores. When I purchased it over a decade ago, I had one of the trem posts reseated due to a crack and the crack repaired. I have played the guitar a lot since then without any issues. A surface neck pocket crack is also evident; this is common on many vintage bolt-on guitars and is of little consequence.The original factory cosmo black hardware is included, along with the Ibanez pickups that were in it when I purchased it; I do not think they are the original factory pickups. I performed upgrades to get it as close to a Japanese Jem as possible:1) DiMarzio Evolution white/gold pickup set with embossed DiMarzio labeling, which are from a JEM owner swapping out his stock JEM pickups for a set of Dark Matters. 2) Gold hardware 3) Black slide-in trem bar (tension is adjusted by plastic collar on trem).4) Ibanez Lo Pro Edge-style trem. It is easy to find an aftermarket Floyd Rose. Finding a gold Lo Pro Edge-style trem was difficult. Here is your opportunity to pick up a vintage JEM that looks, feels, and sounds like the high-priced Japanese JEM for a fraction of the price. A generic hard case is included. I am working hard to skinny down my instrument and parts collection to only the pieces I need for playing/recording, so I will be listing more musical equipment & accessories often. If you are only purchasing one item, please pay within three days of the auction ending. I would like to keep things pleasant and avoid reporting anyone as a non-payer. *** If you plan on bidding on or win more than one auction, consider waiting to pay and sending me a message detailing your bidding plans. Once all of the auctions you are interested in are over, I can combine everything on one invoice for you so you will have a lower shipping cost if I can ship all of the items together. Large items like guitars will each be shipped in separate boxes.*** Bidders with less than 10 transactions will have their bids cancelled. I have repeatedly seen people open an account, bid and win an item, and then disappear and never pay for what they have won, which is not fair to the honest bidders. I will ship guitars to you for $50.00 in addition to the purchase price. It has been costing me between $50 and $65 to ship guitars (including the Ebay/paypay fee), so I charge you the minimum. If it costs me more to ship to you, I just eat the extra cost to keep it simple. This item is sold in AS IS condition. It is a used guitar and will likely have small dents, scratches, and pick marks. I have attempted to document the physical condition in the photographs and show all items that are included, so please check them carefully. If a gig bag or case is not shown in guitar photos or mentioned in the listing, it is not included, but all items will be carefully bubble wrapped, buried in packing peanuts, and packaged carefully. It may take me up to 3 days to get your item packed and submitted to USPS or UPS. All shipping is to Ebay/Paypal USA 48 states registered addresses only. I will happily answer any questions you may have. ALL SALES ARE FINAL. NO RETURNS, so please be sure you want each item.
