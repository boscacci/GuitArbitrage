{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This auction is for a one of a kind Schecter C-7 7 string electric guitar. I removed all of the original finish ( which weighed 1lb.). Then I stained the body red. I sanded the neck so it is super smooth to the touch. There is a discoloration on the back of the neck. This was from an indentation that was filled and finished over at the factory. I refilled it with wood glue and wood dust. You can't feel it at all. I then took a torch, rasps, and files to the body and headstock. I did not touch the neck with the torch at all. Most of the char that you see is pretty much on the surface. There is plenty of good solid wood underneath that the structural integrity of the guitar is fully intact. I then sealed the charred areas with sanding sealer and super glue. So it doesn't just flake off of the guitar when you touch it. Over time and with use this may happen to a small degree. I refretted the guitar with stainless steel fret wire. I made a new bone nut. I installed an EMG 81x and 85x with brushed black metal covers. And I removed the 3-way toggle switch and installed an on-on LED push button. When the switch is in the up position the bridge pickup is selected. When the switch is in the down position the neck pickup is selected. I'm only selling this guitar because I need money for other music gear. This guitar was a lot of hard work and took a long time to finish. It plays and looks amazing!
