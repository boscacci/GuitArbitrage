{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This rare Johnny Hiland model plays perfectly and is in great condition. It has some serious mojo with great resonance, tone, sustain, and feel. Simply put: It is a fantastic player. What makes this particular specimen really stand out tonally is that it sounds like a set-neck Custom 22 or McCarty, but yet it still retains some of the immediacy and spanky quality of a bolt-on. It produces a thunderous, powerful sound with a surprising amount of low-end and great sustain. I've owned one other Hiland signature and a couple similarly designed CE-24s and they did not have these qualities to this high degree. It is most certainly the \"biggest\" sounding bolt-on guitar I've ever played and one of the best of many PRS guitars that I've owned. This axe is in very good condition considering its age and how good of player it truly is. The signs of wear are all very minor. There is some minor wear on the bridge saddles from normal picking hand placement. The body has some shallows scratches and swirls in various places, which is of course very common for black gloss guitars. However, none of these blemishes break the finish and are primarily noticeable only if one looks hard at certain angles. The only two marks that I could get to show well on camera can be found in the red circles of the last 2 pics---a small scratch near the neck pickup and a very small nick at the point of the headstock. The frets are in excellent condition with little to no fret wear. However, there is some browning or patina on the maple fret board in a few places. This is also a very common characteristic of well-played and aged maple boards and could likely be buffed out if one desired. The original Hiland pickups were replaced by the previous owner with Seymour Duncan '59s (I do not have the original pickups). With this change, the push-pull tone pot does not tap the humbucker coils because these Duncans are not splitable. Otherwise, all of the electronics work as intended and sound great. The original hard shell case and case candy in the photos (PRS paperwork, tools, and keys) will be included with purchase. The case has a few scuffs here and there, but the interior is very clean, the latches work perfectly, and it is in very good condition overall. Please check my seller feedback and buy with confidence.
