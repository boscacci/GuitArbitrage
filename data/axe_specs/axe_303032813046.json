{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here we have a gently used G&L Fiorano GTS in transparent red. This guitar is in excellent condition. This listing will include SKB hard shell case which is not a perfect match but works fine. Thanks for looking bid with confidence. CONTINENTAL US SHIPPING ONLY G&L founder Leo Fender had a vision for a new guitar, and his partner George Fullerton sketched that vision. G&L\u2019s Steve Grom uncovered the sketch three decades later in Leo\u2019s workshop, and his colleague Paul Gagon set about turning the vision into reality. He enlisted Jackson Guitars founder Grover Jackson a long-time friend and collaborator to contribute. The result is an instrument that\u2019s steeped in rock-guitar history but groundbreaking: the Fiorano, the first set-neck, 25\u00bd\u201d-scale, three-tuners-to-a-side guitar G&L has ever offered. It\u2019s a striking instrument and, quite simply, it kicks ass. It joins the pioneering 24\u00be\u201d-scale Ascari in G&L\u2019s Tribute Series, and it delivers on its promise. The 24-fret neck and Gagon-designed humbuckers are made for brutal riffing and detuned/drop-tuned heaviness \u2013 but the Fiorino cleans up beautifully when asked.
