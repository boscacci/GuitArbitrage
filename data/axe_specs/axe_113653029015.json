Bolted neck is made of Maple and it is topped with a 22-fret Rosewood Fingerboard.The Tremelo is one of the best I have ever used & easy to install with a unique self locking system.Stays in tune great. Bridge Taylor's tremolo bridge on the SB-T guitar features a modern design that will feel comfortable and familiar to whammy bar fans. It has a lowered fulcrum point that creates a more fluid, balanced feel. This tremolo has a flexible design that lets you set it up to float (pull up and push down) or bottom out (push down only). Locking tuners ensure that tuning stability is maintained.Taylor's contoured bridge gives it a curvy, ultra-smooth feel. This all-aluminum bridge solves the intonation drift and ergonomic problems that often plague other electric bridges. The bridge height can be adjusted both front-to-back and side-to-side. Each of the strings sits in its own saddle, and once the intonation is set, the saddles are locked in place with screws located discretely under the bridge (accessible from the back). Once everything is locked down, you can take the strings off without the saddles moving, maintaining precise intonation.
