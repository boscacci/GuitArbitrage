{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "THIS IS ONE GREAT PLAYING GUITAR . I BOUGHT IT USED A COUPLE OF YEAR'S AGO AND I HAVE SO MANY GUITAR'S THAT I JUST AIN'T PLAYING IT ENOUGH . IT PLAY'S SO GOOD AND EASY .. IT NEEDS TO GO TO A PLAYER THAT WILL PLAY IT A LOT !! THE OWNER BEFORE ME HAD PUT A ROLAND SETUP ON IT AND SCREWED IT ONTO THE BODY , SO THERE ARE SOME HOLES WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THE PHOTO'S . DOES NOT AFFECT THE PLAYING AT ALL !! THEN IT HAS A COUPLE OF CHIPS AROUND THE EDGE . OTHER THAN THAT IT HAS YOUR NORMAL SCRATCHES . I HAVEN'T TRIED TO LOOK UP THE SERIAL NUMBER TO SEE WHAT YEAR IT WAS MADE . I WILL HATE TO SEE THIS GO , BUT I JUST AM NOT PLAYING IT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY KEEPING IT . I DON'T SEE THESE ON HERE MUCH ANYMORE, SO IF YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR ONE THIS JUST MIGHT BE THE ONE FOR YOU !! IT IS STRUNG WITH FAIRLY NEW ELIXIR 10-42 STRINGS . THERE IS NO CASE, BUT WILL BE PACKED VERY WELL FOR SHIPPING . THIS IS A NO RETURN ITEM . IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM LET ME KNOW . THE GUITAR IS A SOLID PLAYER , SO YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH IT. I DON'T HAVE A TREMOLO BAR FOR IT , BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT NEEDED ONE , SO I NEVER GOT ONE FOR IT .NOT SURE WHAT THE PICKUPS ARE , BUT THEY SOUNDED GOOD TO ME , AND ALSO THEY SPLIT TO SINGLE COILS VIA PUSH PULL .GROVER TUNER'S AS WELL. IF YOU HAVE 25 OR LESS POSITIVE FEEDBACK , PLEASE MESSAGE ME BEFORE PURCHASING . I JUST POLISHED THE FRETS UP REALLY NICE AND ADDED A PICTURE TO LET YOU SEE. THE FRETS HAVE SOME WEAR , BUT TON'S OF LIFE LEFT . THERE IS A LITTLE DIVOT ON THE SECOND FRET , DOES NOT EFFECT PLAYING AT ALL . I ACTUALLY HADN'T NOTICED IT UNTIL I POLISHED THE FRETS YESTERDAY . I AM REALLY GOING TO MISS THIS GUITAR !!!
