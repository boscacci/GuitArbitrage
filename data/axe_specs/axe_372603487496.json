{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "DESCRIPTION This is a Gibson SG left handed electric guitar. The serial number is 94042040 on the back of the head stock. From a serial number look up, that indicates it is 1994, the Centennial year of production. The body finish looks to be in good shape, with minor signs of use. The chrome pieces have some minor pitting. The cover cap is gone from the treble/rhythm switch. It is missing on string. I got this from an estate along with two amps. I plugged the guitar in, and it played through the amp. It has not been used for years. I'm not a guitarist, so am unable to assess the playing quality. It comes with the Gibson hard case pictured.
