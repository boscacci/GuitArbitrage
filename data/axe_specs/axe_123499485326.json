{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hi there and thanks for the view. Up for your consideration here is my Kramer Pacer Imperial Vintage in honeyburst finish. It's the Made in Korea model but I have added a lot of upgrades. I replaced the neck with a \"Butala Custom Guitars\" Maple neck with Maple fretboard. It has a 2 3/16 inch width heel and a 1 5/8 inch nut width, genuine Floyd Rose R2 nut, 22 nickle frets, 12 inch fretboard radius, nice thin back profile, genuine Schaller tuning machines, banana headstock and a \"heel accessable\" adjustable truss rod. I bought the neck new in 2015 and it's very comfortable with a lot of fretlife left on it. It's tongue oiled on the back, polyeurothane on the fretboard and clearcoated on the headstock. The clearcoat is a little pitted but to me, it adds to the character. All electronics have been upgraded to Seymour Duncan Pearly Gates neck pickup, Seymour Duncan Custom Shop 78 bridge pickup, CTS Volume / Tone Pots, Switchcraft pickup selector switch, Proline 1/4 inch output jack and a tesi kill switch in the place of the second volume pot. Replaced the Floyd Rose 1000 it came with to a Geniune Floyd Rose Original which I also added a D-Tuna. Dunlop Dual Design straplocks and a nickle selector switch knob round out the upgrades. Ships in a very nice SKB hardshell case (pictured). Guitar is in great shape as is the case. Plays very nice. It has a brighter tone so when you're arpeggiating the top end of chords, they stand out in the mix. It has a nice punchy bottom end as well. Not muddy at all with nice note clarity and great harmonics / sustain. It weighs in at a little past 8 1/2 pounds which puts it right in the middle of the Maple Kramer weight spectrum. Feel free to ask questions. I only ship to the lower 48 United States so please, no international bidders. Thanks again and good luck.", "ItemID": "123499485326", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T02:56:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T02:56:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kramer-Pacer-Imperial-Vintage-Honeyburst-/123499485326", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Manistee, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234994853268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwNFgxNjAw/z/IxsAAOSwvFpb8huC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE4WDE2MDA=/z/klwAAOSws~pb8huM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc2WDE2MDA=/z/yQcAAOSwXMxb8hub/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTg1WDE2MDA=/z/OhQAAOSwfvtb8hu-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg3WDE2MDA=/z/MLMAAOSwjMtb8hvI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQ5WDE2MDA=/z/bdcAAOSwrmRb8hv4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTE4WDE2MDA=/z/cLEAAOSwKO5b8hwA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/4KcAAOSwysFb8hwT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTE3WDE2MDA=/z/OZEAAOSwOsFb8hwp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/n~QAAOSw7Odb8hxA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxMVgxNjAw/z/sPsAAOSwC45b8hxS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/-PwAAOSwzhZb8hxi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "49660", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bashfuldwarf", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 961, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 89, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 590.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 590.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***f", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 256}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Kramer Pacer Imperial Vintage Honeyburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["kramer"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Multicolor"]}]}, "HitCount": 774, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
