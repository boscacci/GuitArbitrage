{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful, phenomenal playing and sounding Eric Johnson Stratocaster by Fender. As a diehard Eric Johnson fanatic, I bought several of his Fender Signature Model guitars over the years and am selling two more in an effort to further slim down my guitar arsenal. Whoever gets this guitar will get an instrument that is as close to Fender Custom Shop quality as any \"regular\" Made-in-USA Strat gets. I have had this instrument for several years and don't recall what year it is. It doesn't matter. This guitar plays phenomenally well. The amazingly clean quarter-sawn neck, the 12\" to 16\" compound radius, bound rosewood fretboard, low weight (7.4 pounds with vibrato arm), custom-spec pickups, two-piece body, ultra-thin nitrocellulose lacquer finish, top-flight materials and super-quality fit and finish all combine to make a this guitar a player's dream. It certainly has been for me. The frets are likewise clean with tons of playing life in them. When you have twenty-plus guitars (I know, it's a sickness) your frets typically stay in great condition. But for two small finish abrasions (as shown in photos) and minimal pickguard rubs, this guitar is as close to mint as they come. It has never been gigged, and comes from a pet-free, smoke-free home. It comes with an excellent case and all original case candy. No reserve auction. No international shipping; shipping to USA and Canada only. Shipping to Continental USA will be $99.95. Guitar and case included as described. Other items shown in background photos are not included in this auction. Thanks for looking and please see my other auctions for more excellent gear! Again, thank you to everyone who views this auction!", "ItemID": "113513859904", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T03:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T03:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Eric-Johnson-Rosewood-Stratocaster-No-EJ15345-Almost-Mint-/113513859904", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Redding, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135138599048080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gB4AAOSwjwZcLD1N/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mpEAAOSwVIBcLD1l/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Fe8AAOSw~wVcLD1~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fQQAAOSwcaBcLD2Z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KH4AAOSwjkZcLD2p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L2sAAOSwWAhcLD29/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3LsAAOSwEwhcLD3O/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6gQAAOSwkDtcLD3l/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KCQAAOSwVcVcLD33/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dFUAAOSwPYNcLD4Y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xKYAAOSwb15cLD5D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kaYAAOSwIr5cLD5B/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "96001", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hiroshimamonamour", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1685, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.2}, "BidCount": 51, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1026.68, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1026.68, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 309}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Eric Johnson Rosewood Stratocaster No. EJ15345, Almost Mint", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Rosewood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster 57 Reissue"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 676, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1051.68, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
