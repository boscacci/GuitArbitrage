{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello everyone! Today we have a pre-order for a very cool Rocky Strat for a very low price. If you click the buy it now button, you will receive a Rocky strat like the one pictured in the first 5 photos of this listing (typically takes two weeks). The artwork on the Fender Squier Stratocaster gets completely hand painted and clear coated. I've seen other versions on ebay, but none of those use the right colors or nail the tiny details like this guitar does (including the green sparkles). Due to everything involved in the guitars design, many hours go into this classic instrument. This guitar is sure to get a lot of attention and would be great for a true fan. Check out my BURGERGUITARS site FOR A VIDEO DEMONSTRATION OF ROCKY and For other cool hand painted guitars (classic and original)! MEXICAN or AMERICAN VERSIONS ALSO AVAILABLE! I do custom work so drop a line if there's something special you want and I'll make it happen! I have done work for famous musicians, museums, and collectors worldwide. *** International buyers: I have shipped many of these over the world until the recent ban of shipping anything with Rosewood internationally, so I can only ship the body. If you are interested, send me a message and we can get you the painted body without the neck. About the artist: Robbie Burger is a multi-instrumentalist singer songwriter and guitar painting artist in central Minnesota. You can download or check out his music on Sound Cloud or the Burgerguitars site. His art encompasses a diverse range of styles (both musically and visually). \"Classic meets contemporary\" has been quoted by several fans of his work. Let Robbie Burger create something special you will treasure always.", "ItemID": "401709486802", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T16:32:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-17T04:26:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rocky-Fender-Stratocaster-Guitar-Strat-Squier-hand-painted-vintage-des-/401709486802", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Saint Cloud, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/4017094868028080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7Q0AAOSwrClZxxYZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7IQAAOSwO71ZxxYh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9FsAAOSwAXhZxxYm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XaQAAOSwlvlZxxYu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZksAAOSwsU5ZxxY1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zSwAAOSweW5U59tW/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lWMAAOSwstxU59tc/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/t0AAAOSwEeFU59tl/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uEcAAOSwEeFU59tw/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6o4AAOSwrklU9erT/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/E4EAAOSwqu9U59uL/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ4MlgxNDE5/z/YdcAAOSwBahU9erE/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "56301", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "burgerguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1319, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 841}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "!!!!!!!!
