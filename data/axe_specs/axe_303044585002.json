{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Often copied, but never surpassed, the Stratocaster is arguably the world\u2019s most-loved electric guitar. Electrifying the music world since its debut in 1954, its natural, versatile sound made the Stratocaster the benchmark for exceptional guitar tones. The American Professional Stratocaster isn\u2019t a re-imagining of the classic design; it\u2019s the authentic original model, evolved. V-Mod Stratocaster pickups are engineered using a proprietary blend of alnico magnet types for the neck and middle pickups.Each pickup is voiced specifically for its position, creating high-output tone with vintage warmth and the crisp, clear sound that made Fender a legend. The treble-bleed circuit maintains the high end when turning down the volume knob to reduce gain, letting your tone shine through, no matter where the instrument\u2019s volume is set.The new pop-in tremolo arm securely stays in position, no matter how hard you play. The arm tension can also be adjusted for a perfectly dialed-in feel that matches any player\u2019s preference. Designed for comfort and speed, the new American Professional \u201cDeep C\u201d neck profile sports more substantial shoulders\u2014somewhat between a \u201cModern C\u201d- and \u201cU\u201d-shaped profile. The increased mass and altered geometry creates a more natural feel that\u2019s perfect for chord and single-note playing alike.Narrow-tall frets are taller and narrower than their medium jumbo cousins, making them especially effective for bending notes and playing chords up the neck with perfect intonation. The Elite Molded Case features body-hugging contours to protect your cherished instrument, TSA latches for increased security and nested stacking ability for easy storage and secure transport.
