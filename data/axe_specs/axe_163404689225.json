{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here we have a rather nice mid 1900's piece.I believe this to be a German made Hopf build, they were responsible for making some very fine guitars from the late 40's through to later 50's. This being an affordable build of relatively good quality, if it wasn't then it wouldn't still be here in this kind of condition, looking great and fully playable, the next one in the line will need work, this one fully overhauled..These designs being of the timeless art deco inspired style, are very rare to see these days, first one we have had through the shop with this style of headstock,This beauty has a Jazz style body, and being an early build, has been made with good quality materials, Maple mainly. The types of material and the nitro finish contribute to the patina, which has a nicely evolved look with the usual weathering of the lacquer seen on guitars of this age and grace. She has a Maple body, what appears to be solid quarter sawn Maple sides and a three piece neck, also of Maple and built up in this way so that has remained steady and isn't warped like a lot of these 50's numbers. These features yield a snappy yet well rounded and defined tone, with a nice bass response for this style of guitar. Now fitted with the most appropriate strings - the best - D'Addario phosphor bronze Flat Tops - and sounding very nice indeed. The playing action is set 'low', good strong tone and neck has stood times test remarkably well. \u221e Recently lightly restored and professionally set up \u221e New D'Addario flat tops fitted and sounding very authentic \u221e Structure good, no issues, plays well and as it should. \u221e Cosmetics very good for the age with the some gathered historical marks, nothing of note and very clean overall. Stylish Jazz player approaching 70 years and in good order, player ready and good to go for another 70 I should wager, such a strange word - wager!
