{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a Fender Jaguar HH Body made in Mexico. There is cosmetic wear on the finish as shown on the pics. Purchased this item as it is in order to build a guitar but it never happened. Was working on 3 Fender Jaguar projects in the last 2 years but I found myself just collecting parts rather than putting together guitars and decided to sell all of them as I have enough guitars. Please have a look on my other auctions for more Fender Jaguar fun and a few pedals. Trust my feedback! Any questions please let me know! Starts at 99p! Happy Bidding :) PLEASE NOTE : If you buy 2 or more of my items I\u2019ll combine postage, you only pay what I pay :) Postage : If less than what is mentioned on my ad, the difference will be send back to your PayPal once I dispatch the item. Postage is only to the UK and Europe, if you are outside the UK/EU or have less than 10 feedback, contact me prior placing a bid on this auction or else your bid will be cancelled and you\u2019ll be blocked.", "ItemID": "273589438215", "EndTime": "2018-12-11T20:18:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-01T20:18:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Jaguar-HH-Body-Mexico-/273589438215", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "LONDON, London", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735894382158080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/UIgAAOSwT-pcAuy7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/TysAAOSwarlcAuzE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/gPkAAOSwdrdcAus-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/Cf8AAOSwPeVcAus~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/SuUAAOSwMpFcAutA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/7dsAAOSwYo1cAutB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/x9cAAOSw5cZcAutC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "E2 0AH", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sguitarded", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1303, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 104.04, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 79.0, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 143}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "UK", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Jaguar HH Body Mexico", "HitCount": 337, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "GB", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsWithin": "14 days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 81.0, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 10, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
