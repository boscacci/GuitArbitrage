{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Custom Flying V Style Guitar James Hetfield EMGs This is a custom V Guitar that is professionally set up and ready to rock. It is not a Gibson but the quality you can expect is very similar, in my opinion. Here's what I can honestly tell you. I've owned several Gibson Flying V Guitars. This Guitar is on point with what you'd expect from a Gibson or Epiphone but at a big savings. The Gibson's are usually about 2-3 times more money. Is it worth it and do you notice? For the price, this is a steal. I have similar Gibson's that are very very close. The main difference is the Pro Setup and the James Hetfield EMG Pickups. It makes this guitar purr and growl beyond expectations with awesome Metallica tone. This Guitar is a very collectible guitar that is somewhat rare. I've included a brand new EMG solder-less wiring harness and solder-less EMG switch as well. This Guitar just needs a Player =)I am certain that you will love the look and feel of this guitar. I've shown, two very minor imperfections that sort of disappear into the black in my opinion. The Guitar is straight and stays in tune great, and includes a fresh set of Ernie Ball Hybrid 9 strings. My favorite.Thank you for looking and have a great day!", "ItemID": "153348311440", "EndTime": "2019-01-26T18:56:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T22:10:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-Flying-V-Style-Guitar-James-Hetfield-EMG-metallica-/153348311440", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Van Nuys, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533483114408080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e~cAAOSw8R9cKyTs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JM8AAOSwt0dcKyTk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zGgAAOSw3BJcKyUJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-0kAAOSwD1pcKyUP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/76sAAOSw69tcKyTz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NjYAAOSwpLdcKyTs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VhcAAOSwPXFcKyT3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/c50AAOSwMQ1cKyTw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VGYAAOSwGUpcKyT~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "91405", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "theboogle", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 351, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom Flying V Style Guitar James Hetfield EMG metallica", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Harley Benton"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 227, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
