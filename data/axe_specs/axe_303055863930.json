{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "CAREFULLY READ ITEM DESCRIPTION AND THE TERMS OF SALE. Thanks!ITEM DESCRIPTION:This Ibanez Joe Satriani JS1000 is a fantastic guitar, is the place where the whole JS craze started, and is in solid preowned condition, but shows a few pictured dings. I have a handful of these axes and love `em all. These are sleek machines and provide coil-tap and phase reverse via push-pull pots. If you haven't played one of Joe's signature axes yet, then you owe it to yourself to grab this one by the neck and throttle up heavy! Ax ships with its hard-shell case.
