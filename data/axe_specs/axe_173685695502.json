Interesting History: I Purchased this guitar rig from a Cruise Ship Musician, a real pro. The musician explained: This was his practice rig, no stage time. Professionally Respected. He bought this Epip LP because it kinda felt similar to his 1960 Gibson LP Standard. I played both, and the 1960 LP just isn't worth all that extra money (sorry Gibson).
