{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great players guitar!\u00a0 In the beautiful burgundy, this guitar plays like butter.\u00a0 Could use a setup to your preferences, but that shouldn't be a problem.\u00a0 I think the frets are original, with lots of life.\u00a0 The tuners appear to be original, one is bent a little.\u00a0 One of the tone knobs might be aftermarket.\u00a0 The only real negative on this guitar is that the electronics have been replaced.\u00a0 They are Fender OEM from the 90s (I believe).\u00a0 The pots have been swapped as well.\u00a0 The switch appears to be original.\u00a0 The pickup covers do seem to be original.\u00a0\u00a0 The guitar has some cosmetic dings, I can send more pics if you want.\u00a0 There is finish wear on the neck.\u00a0 One of the ferrules appears to be replaced and there may be some other parts that are not 100% original. This is a player grade vintage instrument. But you can see the body and the neck are original to each other, the case functions and is original to the guitar.\u00a0 It plays well and weighs in at 9lbs 2.5oz.\u00a0 If you have questions or need a pic of something specific, then email me.\u00a0 This is an AS IS listing and I have described it to the best of my knowledge.", "ItemID": "264138221390", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T00:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T00:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1979-Fender-Hardtail-Stratocaster-Burgundy-w-OHSC-/264138221390", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Springdale, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641382213908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g5oAAOSwNphcPLqx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HFAAAOSwu3ZcPLqx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eLUAAOSwqrZcPLqv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7FoAAOSwWapcPLpv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QXAAAOSwg1JcPLpv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lLQAAOSw7D1cPLpx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FcIAAOSwuNNcPLpz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/59kAAOSwaiBcPLpu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ulMAAOSwO-hcPLpx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YQoAAOSwNShcPLpx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zPwAAOSwusdcPLqw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JCMAAOSw0ylcPLqv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "72762", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nawainwright", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 881, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1050.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1050.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5310}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1979 Fender Hardtail Stratocaster in Burgundy w/OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 332, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1075.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
