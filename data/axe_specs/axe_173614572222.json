{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a reasonably faithful reproduction of a famous guitar that I am not allowed to mention, but if you know your guitars, you can figure it out. I improved it by widening the neck and replacing the fret board with the good stuff (ebony). All new frets, properly leveled and re-crowned and polished. The electronics work fine as well. This is a lot of fun to play, and you can take it to the next level if you want to, or just enjoy it. Certainly a much lower price than its domestically produced original counterpart. Comes with hard shell case, which is missing a bumper or two. Ships to continental US only for $50.", "ItemID": "173614572222", "EndTime": "2018-11-02T18:00:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-30T00:27:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Semi-hollowbody-electric-guitar-/173614572222", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Surprise, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736145722228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/u4gAAOSwxxVbzkuG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/v74AAOSw0Btbzkug/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/kCMAAOSwr4Zbzkuv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "85374", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "surpisesam", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1113, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.1}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 180.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 180.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 73}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Semi hollowbody electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple ply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural maple"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["All modifications in condition description."]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Unknown"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Applicable Regions", "Value": ["Unknown, probably pacific rim."]}]}, "HitCount": 81, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 182.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar was built from a kit in 2015.
