This one has a really nice chunky neck...fills your hand perfectly. I have owned and enjoyed the guitar roughly the past 10 years and it rocks. Action is even and low all the way up the neck. It is a pro Polaris White refin. You can see where the former vibrato mounting holes were doweled (I point out behind the bridge in the photos).

The hinges are not the best so the case needs to be aligned properly when putting the top down.  I would say the case is appropriate for storage and would probably use another one if you are traveling or carrying the guitar regularly.  Guitar to the best of my knowledge has original tuners, knobs, wiring harness, Duncan Antiquity pickups, pro Polaris White refin and relicing which looks age appropriate.  There is a lot of age appropriate finish checking and the hardware has age appropriate patina.  Frets in great shape, nice neck and smooth dark fingerboard.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
