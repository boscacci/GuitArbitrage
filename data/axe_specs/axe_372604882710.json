{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2013 Fender Stratocaster 1965 American Vintage Reissue Here is a genuine American made Fender '65 Reissue Strat in the rare Dakota Red finish! Actual weight is 8 lbs 3 oz.It's spent a lot of time on the stage and the body a lot of small dings, scratches and wear. Just like getting a Custom Shop Relic but without the hefty price tag! There are no major issues like cracks or structural issues. The neck is straight and the frets show very little wear. It's in excellent playing condition with no dead frets or other major issues. The fretboard and back of the neck are clean with no dings or worn areas. The headstock has a few small nicks, but no cracks, repairs or extra holes.The hardware and electronics are original and in excellent working condition. The pickguard was changed to mint green to make it look like an early '65 and I don't have the original. It's easy to change it out if you want to go with a different color. It comes with the original case which has a lot of wear and tear. All of the latches, hinges and handle are in working order, but the right latch has lost it's spring and needs to be pushed closed. It's not a pretty case, but it gets the job done and matches the relic look of the guitar! The interior is clean and has no bad odors. It comes with the original case accessories. Please note that I do not set up my guitars before mailing. I have played it and everything is great as far as I'm concerned, but you may need to change the strings, adjust the action or do other maintenece to get it to your preferences.
