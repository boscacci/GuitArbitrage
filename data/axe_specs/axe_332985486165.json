{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "MAKE AN OFFER These were made in the early 70's with soap bar flat top pickups. They came with slider switches to turn on/off pickups. I got this stripped, no hardware or electronics. I have changed the following from the original. 3-way toggle, no more slider switches. Bigsby with a tune-o-matic bridge, no more wrap around bridge. Side output jack, not on the plastic cover plate. Also, no more inline button style tuners, these are Kluson Deluxe tuners. The pickups are Seymour Duncan antiquity mini-Humbuckers. Brass Nut, great sustain. COLOR IS A WALNUT LACQUER-GLOSS FINISH. There are some small nicks here and there, a small sand thru on the back of the bottom horn, one on the back of headstock. You can kind of see them in the photo's. Overall a VERY good looking finish. -THE PICTURES SHOW QUITE A BIT OF DUST ON THE GUITAR. NO STRUCTURAL DAMAGE ANYWHERE-NO REPAIRED DAMAGE The neck is straight and flat, good fret life left, just set up by Space Guitar of Cleveland, Ohio. Great Guitar, great player. I have always been a Pete fan so this one is pretty cool to me. The serial # and Made in USA are barely visible, these were printed in ink on these models. Whoever stripped this originally did not mask them off too well. you can see them somewhat when held at an angle(see photo). This guitar plays great, the pickups sound great. These are some of my favorites, from Seymour's website; The Antiquity II Adjustable Mini humbucker bridge has a truly unique tonal character. Its midrange emphasis brings focus to the lows, and adds a gritty sweetness to the highs. Over driven sounds break up nicely with a smooth, warm growl. This Les Paul Deluxe replacement delivers that familiar sparkly mini humbucker tone with a slightly softened treble attack.Description The Antiquity II Adjustable Mini humbucker is a pickup with a unique look and sound. It has a cool mix of grit and growl that gives it a tonal character unlike any other pickup. In the neck position it provides a full, warm, tone without being woofy, and it has a midrange quality that sounds like perfect blend of a P90 and a full sized humbucker. Clean tones are bell-like and articulate, and dirty tones have a friendly growl. Single notes will be sweet and musical, while chords will have ... More a beautiful lower midrange warmth.Each Antiquity II Mini Humbucker is hand built in exactly the same way the originals were constructed, and then aged to look and sound like an authentic vintage classic. We use a hand cut P90 soapbar cover sized mounting ring, and these pickups mount to the guitar just like on an original Les Paul Deluxe. Staying true to the 50s era Gibson pickup, these humbuckers are not wax potted which takes you right to the edge of harmonic breakup.These can be used in any guitar with a Les Paul Deluxe or P90 soapbar (with our Tapped Mounting Plate) sized pickup route.The Antiquity II Adjustable Mini humbucker is a pickup with a unique look and sound.
