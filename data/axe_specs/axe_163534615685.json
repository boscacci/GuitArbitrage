{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Amazing sounding and playing 1981 Ibanez AS-200. She has been played, but for the few nicks she does have, she doesn't have any that affect playability. Non original fairly recent Ibanez branded AS-200 case in great shape. There is some aging in the binding, as you can see in the pics. She is almost 40 years old. There is some finish missing at the output jack; I meant to get some sort of brass poker chip to cover that but never got around to it. There is a spot on the back of the neck where a bit of finish is missing, but I have never felt it when playing the guitar. Electronically she has zero issues, playability there are zero issues, and she sounds absolutely wonderful with the rare and original Super 58 pickups. Fantastic Ibanez quality - Gibson just doesn't make this quality. I just bought another guitar I will be playing more often and simply can't afford to keep them both. Free insured shipping included in the price for US buyers, we can talk if you live elsewhere. There is no rosewood in her so no CITES issues. If you want more pics just ask, happy to take more. Thanks :)", "ItemID": "163534615685", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T19:14:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-09T20:49:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-AS-200-81-all-original-first-year-w-Super-58s-free-shipping-/163534615685", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Blackwood, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635346156858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MbEAAOSwupBcXzw8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sqUAAOSw-ttcXzw8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CJAAAOSw6FNcXzw7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K1MAAOSwC4lcXzw7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/P08AAOSw3x9cXzw4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IMAAAOSwTJZcXzw5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BPMAAOSwgs5cXzw5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AyQAAOSwLXBcXzw7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MfMAAOSwBPxcXzw4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wuAAAOSwYpVcXzw7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H68AAOSwa7RcXzw7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08012", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jimandmaurawhite", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 227, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 619}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez AS-200 '81 all original first year w/ Super 58s, free shipping", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 228, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
