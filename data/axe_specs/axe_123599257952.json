{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you are reading this, you already know what this is. Highly sought after brutal high gain tone monster from the early 90's with four tubes, five effects loops, 3 channels, two of which have a pull knob that engages more gain and a low frequency cut that mimics a tubescreamer boost. It currently has 3 sovtek tubes and one new JJ for the ultra channel that really helped tame the highs. More gain than you would ever want for modern high gain metal sounds, nice cleans, but it really shines at saturated 80's shred rock and classic metal. Sounds best played loud, really cuts through a mix. The preamp has some visible wear. All jacks, pots, and tube sockets have been cleaned with electrical contact cleaner and the preamp is in working condition without any noise or crackling knobs and all channels/knobs/inputs/outputs work. No visible corrosion or rust. ***A common issue with these preamps is that the volume on certain channels can drop to low levels, but this is easily fixed by putting a patch cable in the send/return of one or more of the (five!) effects loops. This preamp had this problem but it disappeared after I cleaned the FX loop jacks. However, I still recommend using patch cables in the loops at all times to avoid it reoccurring. I cannot guarantee it will not happen again, but I do guarantee the preamp works without any other issue and you will not have any trouble if you put some patch cables in the fx send/returns.*** No footswitch is included, but I'll include a stereo TRS cable that can connect to any ordinary latching 2-button footswitch or an fx processor that has built-in amp channel switching (like the TC G Major, which is how I've been using it). Upon request, I can include a simple 2 button footswitch I built and throw it in at no extra cost, just let me know you want the footswitch in the checkout, just know it won't look pretty! I can provide video of the preamp operating normally upon request.
