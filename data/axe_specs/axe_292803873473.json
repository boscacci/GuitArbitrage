{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A couple of people have asked me if the original pickups come with the guitar. I thought I still had them but I find that I don't, so, no, the original pickups are not included. 2014 Epiphone SG Pro. One owner guitar. Pickups changed to Seymour Duncan P-Rails. Upgraded with high quality wiring harness from 920D Custom. Guitar is in Excellent Condition. Finish is excellent with almost no sign of wear. No wear on frets. Action good with no buzzing up and down neck. The P-Rails change this Epiphone SG Pro from a well built guitar with mediocre pickups to one of distinctive tonal character and versatility. See the chart photo for the range of tones available. Different tones are created with the push/pull tone pots. No case with this guitar. Ships to USA only. Here's what Seymour Duncan says about their P-Rails: In the past, if you wanted humbucker tone, P90 tone, and Strat tone, you would have needed three different guitars. But now, the P-Rails humbucker delivers all three sounds in a pickup that is a drop-in replacement for any stand sized humbucker slot. Using any 3-way (on-off-on) mini-switch, each unique hybrid humbucker can be split to give you an super fat P90, or it can be split to the Rail coil for Strat like tone. With both coils on, you get a big sounding humbucker that packs a nice full punch. The neck version is wound RWRP so that, you can use both P90s or both Rails together and get hum-canceling tone.Hand built in Santa Barbara, CA, each P-Rails humbucker uses a pair of alnico 5 bar magnets, comes with a 4-conductor leadwire for all of the wiring options, and are vacuum wax potted for squeal free operation.", "ItemID": "292803873473", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T03:46:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-05T03:46:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2014-Epiphone-SG-Pro-w-Seymour-Duncan-P-Rails-Ex-Condition-/292803873473", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928038734738080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1Nzg=/z/71cAAOSwKDpb34Az/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTU0/z/uTQAAOSwsptb34A4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NjA=/z/ECMAAOSwYUZb34Ay/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjA3/z/c0EAAOSwfMlb34A3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MzQ=/z/kr0AAOSwAPtb34Ay/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5OTA=/z/xqwAAOSwNWhb34A5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjg2/z/OR0AAOSwCtNb34A7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTAz/z/~RAAAOSwF1tb34A3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "49503", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dirkandval", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1770, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 271.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 271.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 173}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2014 Epiphone SG Pro w/ Seymour Duncan P-Rails Ex Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2014"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG"]}]}, "HitCount": 286, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 276.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
