{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Professionally set up and ready to Play. EPIPHONE ALLEYKAT (MODEL ETAK) The Epiphone AlleyKat (like the FlameKat) features the Kat-Series small, semi hollow-body design. But this guitar features a Tune-o-matic bridge, StopBar tailpiece and a combination of a \u201957 Classic Humbucker in the bridge position and a \u201cNew York\u201d Mini humbucker in the neck position. Don't take our word for it...check out what others say: \"This sleek little guitar is a great choice for anyone looking for a rockin'-style instrument without the bulk\" - Guitar & Bass (UK) July 2004 \"We could hardly tear ourselves from the rhythm mode for muted, acoustic-style damping, sweet highs and twangy surfy bass; a setting so warm you could huddle around it at festivals.\" - Guitar & Bass (UK) July 2004 \"...we're adding this guitar to the goddamn-we-wish-we-didn't-have-to-give-this-back list.\" - Guitar & Bass (UK) July 2004 \"A working musician these days is likely to be conversant with rock, blues, country, swing, rockabilly, jazz, hip-hop, and music that incorporates any combination thereof. The AlleyKat's sonic potential, from acoustic mellowness to full-throated rock roar, makes it equally at home in any of these musical situations.\" - Michael Ross GuitarOne Magazine November 2000 \"...the best semi we can remember coming through the mag for years and is without a doubt one of the guitars of the year.\" - GUITARIST (UK) December 2002 This item is used.
