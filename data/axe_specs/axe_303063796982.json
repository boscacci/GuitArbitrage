{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "CAREFULLY READ ITEM DESCRIPTION AND THE TERMS OF SALE. Thanks!ITEM DESCRIPTION:For sale is a butt-kickin' Peavey Eddie Van Halen Wolfgang in the always stunning green finish. I believe this to be a 2002 build. The ax is in good cosmetic condition and shows nothing but typical signs of handling and use. If I could I would hoard these axes; as they always seem to play like butter.
