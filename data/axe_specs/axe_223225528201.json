{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a very gently used 2011 Jackson SLXT Trans Black Electric Guitar with Rosewood fingerboard and Jackson Shark Fin inlay fret markers. There is a laminate flame top with factory installed EMGHZ pickups. I had a Fishman Piezo Tune-O-Matic Bridge installed post-factory. You can see the mini-selector switch installed above the factory pick-up selector switch - this bridge costs $209.95 on Musicians Friend alone. You can see the battery access in the back. There are some small scratches, but overall in great shape. There is a tool mark next to the lower edge of the bridge (see photos) and IT DOESN'T SHOW IN THE PHOTOS BUT THE FINISH IS SCRATCHED ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF IN ALL DIRECTIONS AROUND THE TOOL MARK. I've recently had the guitar set up for 9s, and I had the frets ground down for a lower profile than what is found on most Jacksons so this plays really well. Jackson soft case included (but guitar stand in photos not included.) Flat shipping UPS ground. No offers to end auction early accepted. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "223225528201", "EndTime": "2018-11-17T18:22:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-10T18:22:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2011-Jackson-SLXT-Trans-Black-Flame-Top-w-Fishman-Piezo-Bridge-Soft-Case-/223225528201", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Norwalk, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232255282018080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/cuUAAOSwN3Nb5x-y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/XsIAAOSwaepb5x-y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/3CcAAOSwkitb5x-z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/lEUAAOSwhnlb5x-0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/XfoAAOSwwhxb5x-1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/TlUAAOSwqqJb5x-1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/XscAAOSwaepb5x-2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg3NDk=/z/jf0AAOSwIGxb5x-2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06858", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "parkvt", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 196, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 638}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2011 Jackson SLXT Trans Black Flame Top w/Fishman Piezo Bridge & Soft Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 105, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 127.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
