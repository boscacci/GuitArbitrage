{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is my USA built Guild Bluesbird in a beautiful flametop sunburst. The photo lighting really doesn't do justice to how beautiful this guitar really is and sorry about any light reflections in the pics. I purchased the guitar used and don't know it's exact age but it's probably about 20yrs old and is in excellent very well preserved condition and so is the case. There may be some light swirls from cloth polishing and some nice patina on the pickup covers but that's about it. Also, the tone is just awesome, ie, very smooth and sweet. Everything on guitar is original. I have no complaints about this guitar period and you won't be disappointed with it either. Please email me with any questions. Shipping is FREE to the lower 48 USCON states only with no international bids or shipping considered. I do reserve the right to end auction early if it is sold locally. I have some other very nice gear that I may be listing soon too. Thanks for looking and happy bidding.", "ItemID": "123664124916", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T17:37:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-25T17:37:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Guild-Bluesbird-Flametop-Usa-/123664124916", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "USA", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236641249168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sK8AAOSwbaxcdBsE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6wAAAOSw3g5cdBuH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/99EAAOSwTfBcdBuV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KVsAAOSwoOxcdBu~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PLcAAOSw1vxcdBvQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LT4AAOSwFeNcdBvj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blu_melody", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2057, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 292}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Guild Bluesbird Flametop Usa", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Guild"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 109, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Beautiful guitar.....", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
