{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a Gibson SG Special Les Paul 100th Anniversary Edition Electric Guitar with original Gibson hardshell case. 2015, the year of robot tuners and brass nuts, neither of which you will find on this guitar. The guitar has numerous upgrades. Robot tuners were replaced with Grover Rotomatic tuners. Brass nut was replaced with a bone nut. All of the mother board electronics were replaced with individual pots, capacitors, and wiring, old fashioned like it should be. A set of Seymour Duncan Hot Rodded Pickups (SH-4 JB bridge, SH-2 Jazz neck) were installed. And finally a USA-made Bigsby B5 with Vibramate V5 was installed. The Vibramate allows the Bigsby to be installed to the guitar without mods; therefore, if you prefer to remove it and put the stoptail back on, you can and not see extra holes. All work was completed by a professional luthier. The guitar plays fantastic and is in mint condition. Auction is for guitar and case only. Guitar is being sold outside of eBay; therefore, I reserve the right to end the auction early. Guitar is being sold as-is and returns are not accepted. Payment is due within 3 business days or I reserve the right to re-list the guitar. I will only ship to the CONTINENTAL US. Shipping will be flat $65 for insured standard ground.
