{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a used Fender American Professional Deluxe ShawBucker Telecaster. The Tele is in good condition but has been played and has a few dings and marks on the neck. See photos where near some of the fret edges there are nicks in the edge. Is does not effect the playing but I wanted to make sure that the buyer realizes it is not 100% perfect. The frets are in good shape and the electronics are working perfectly. The guitar was used both at home and at gigs but is from a non-smoking house. In the late '60s and early '70s guitarists wanted hum-free tone based on the sound of an amp about to blow up. You asked\u2014so we listened and created the Telecaster Deluxe in 1973. Today's version, the American Professional Telecaster Deluxe ShawBucker, brings modern, player-oriented features to the stage and studio, and can still make an amp sizzle without breaking a sweat.
