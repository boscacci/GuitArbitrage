{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale, a 1983 Washburn Falcon Model C in near mint condition and in perfect working order. Very likely a one-off custom color example, this Wing Series Falcon is 100% original and features a deep purple non-catalog factory finish. Few guitars are more undeniably of their time than this Washburn, and this Falcon channels the '80s with a pair of stock \"power sustain\" humbuckers with original coil taps and a two-point vibrato with brass saddles capable of very deep, expressive dives. The Dimarzio-esque pickups with double cream bobbins are modeled after the Super Distortion, and each coil has identical adjustable magnets so there is no tonal difference between the primary and slug coil, rendering the magnetic field even across the full width of the pickup. The wider magnetic field gives the bridge pickup lots of honk and enough cut without being too bright, and the neck pickup is well rounded and creamy, with a wonderfully vocal and expressive sound with the tone control rolled back. The tonal range of the guitar is quite remarkable, and while these pickups excel at high gain and can provide ample crunch and tight lows, the individual factory coil taps for each pickup allow for a sparkling, snappy single coil sound that has a glassy snap. The body is solid ash with a maple cap, providing a complex midrange and incredible note attack and top end articulation. The rosewood fretboard adds some warmth to the signal, while the brass saddles and carved bone nut assure great string to string separation, optimal sustain, and plenty of top end snap. Produced at the Matsumoku factory in Japan, this Washburn has the top notch quality consistent with the reputation of this factory. The guitar weighs 9lbs and has been professionally setup with 10-46 strings and comfortable action. The neck has a D shaped profile with decent chunk and roundness, measuring .861\" deep at the first fret and graduating to .985\" at the 12th fret and beyond. On the bound rosewood fretboard, the original medium jumbo frets are flawless with plenty of meat and height. The bone nut measures 1 5/8\" in width and on the headstock, the original chrome tuning machines turn smoothly. All of the electronics work as they should, with individual Volume and Tone controls for each pickup, and both Volume knobs have individual push/pull coil taps. All solder joints are untouched and everything is exactly how this guitar left the Washburn factory over three decades ago. The custom color one-off factory finish is a deep glossy shade of lavender and the guitar is in near mint condition, with the only wear of note being one ding on the top between the Tone knobs. A niche model with a fervent fanbase, this Washburn Falcon is simply a lovely, resonant instrument with great tonal versatility and a look that certainly reflects its era of production.
