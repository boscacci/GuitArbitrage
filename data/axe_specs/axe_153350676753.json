{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "My father is a musician and has decided to down size his collection of guitars, This Gibson Flying V Korina Reissue 1983 Natural , is one that he bought brand new when he was 15 years old. He\u2019s been the only owner since . In 1985 he had dimarzio pickups professionally installed with 2 switches to get over 10 different sounds . This guitar is number A221 made in 83. It\u2019s been played a handful of times and aside from in special occasions when he would bring the guitar out for a jam session was it around smoke , other then that\u2019s it\u2019s been kept in a pet and smoke free home for 38 years . Also comes with original Gibson hard guitar case. If requested I can send more pictures or a clip of the guitar being played. It\u2019s been extremely well taken care of.
