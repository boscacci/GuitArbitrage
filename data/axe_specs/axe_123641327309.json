One piece back, nice big piece of mahogany from the \"good wood\" era of Gibson. Guitar has exposed burstbuckers. The neck position is very warm, sounds almost vintage in its soft woolliness and attack. The bridge pickup growls with the right amount of attitude and sounds great. This guitar was played, has some fretwear and finish wear around the edges. Its a great guitar and is perfect for someone who wants a really nice sounding Les Paul that they can actually use. The guitar is aging just right and looks the part. This will be a great guitar to hang on to for a few years. Thank you for looking and best of luck bidding!
