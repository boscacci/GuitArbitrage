{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Peavey Power Slide Electric Lap Steel Guitar - With Chardon Gigbag, Strap & Shubb SP2. Condition is Used.The guitar is in very good condition. Includes upgraded Shubb SP2 slide. Shipping to US lower 48 only. The lap-type steel you can play standing up. It's not a lap steel, not a resonator, and it's not a conventional steel guitar. This instrument is in response to a huge number of requests for a lap-type steel that could be played standing up. The shape of the Power Slide is designed to position the playing surface (fingerboard) to the left of the player's body allowing unhampered access to the playing surface. The Power Slide Guitar's unique 4-point suspension and the special \"Y\" strap enable the instrument to be played either horizontally or vertically (and almost anywhere in-between). The Power Slide uses Peavey's unique magnet loaded humbucking pickup with patented \"T-60 type\" mode/tone control. The 2-octave scale provides more tonal flexibility than any Slide guitar that can be played standing up. Peavey's \"Power Slide\" comes with its special \"Y\" strap to accommodate its \"different\" shape. With a 6-string configuration, you're already familiar with the string gauges and tuning, and at this price, you can't lose.", "ItemID": "323669309398", "EndTime": "2019-02-04T03:04:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-28T03:04:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Power-Slide-Electric-Lap-Steel-Guitar-Gigbag-Strap-Shubb-SP2-/323669309398", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nicholasville, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236693093988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/v4YAAOSwakxcTm8-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uigAAOSwXFRcTm9G/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-OUAAOSwsrlcTm9T/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UE8AAOSwPk9cTm9Q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HzgAAOSwwgBcTm9X/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CzcAAOSwkqtcTm9n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tEIAAOSwygZcTm9n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/80kAAOSwH-RcTm9r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4mYAAOSw~llcTm9l/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YdwAAOSwbWJcTm-H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "40356", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nichtech", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 310, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 14, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 157.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 157.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 9}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey Power Slide Electric Lap Steel Guitar - With Gigbag, Strap & Shubb SP2", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}]}, "HitCount": 383, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 160.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
