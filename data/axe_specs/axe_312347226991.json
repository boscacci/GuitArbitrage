{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I think this is the Faded Model, anyway, when I bought it someone had added the Bigsby and you can see the holes where the old bridge was. Has the classic SG sound with the added benefit of the tremolo. Great Shape. A little players swirling etc. but a 9 0f 10. Nice player, selling because I'm getting married. Nice quality Gibson. I will try to add the serial number later, and I have another listing for a BC Rich Mockingbird also. Returns only for gross misrepresentations.
