{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is my charvel strat I've been playing pretty much every day since 1987. I believe it is a model 6, pearl white, plays and sounds great. Has wear and chips from playing it so much as shown. I bought it from the original owner in 87, long time ago but I think he said these Seymour Duncan active electronics pickups were a pretty expensive upgrade (takes.a 9 volt battery) I had Jackson soloists and once I played this one, I sold them and have been playing it ever since. It's never had a cracked neck or headstock repair or anything weird like that. Neck is straight. Jackson/Floyd rose trem. (Cant find arm, but will include if I do) neck through body, shark inlays, 24 frets. Original charvel \"chainsaw\" hard case in beautiful condition. Not an expert on these obviously , just a guy that enjoyed playing it for 31 years or so. Frets buzz a little up around 12th when you bend, I think I had guitar center replace that one switch that doesn't match a while back. Any other questions please ask.
