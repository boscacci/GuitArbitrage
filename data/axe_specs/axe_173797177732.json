{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1960's Harmony Rocket Triple Pickup Electric Hollowbody Guitar.. Condition is Used. I don't know much about guitars. This one is in rough shape. See photos for the best description. The steel-reinforced neck is rusting and has at least one rust hole in it. Probably about an inch and a half long. The guitar was old and Dusty when I got it. I wiped it down with a damp cloth. This is for someone who just loves to collect guitars or for someone who likes to restore guitars. It looks like a lot of the original parts are with it. Like the pickups and all the knobs. The wooden body of the guitar seems to be in pretty good shape. This comes with a beat up old case. Possibly the original case but it is worse off than the guitar.", "ItemID": "173797177732", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T17:09:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-16T17:09:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1960s-Harmony-Rocket-Triple-Pickup-Electric-Hollowbody-Guitar-/173797177732", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tampa, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737971777328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/GZ4AAOSwLi1caED~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/kXMAAOSwuJlcaEET/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/100AAOSwCqZcaEEu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/iyYAAOSwFstcaEE4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/U4kAAOSwiZhcaEFI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/V8gAAOSweTlcaEFX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ON8AAOSwejNcaEFo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/8~oAAOSwcOtcaEF1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/FxEAAOSwcHRcaEGT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/-KYAAOSwxDxcaEGg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/sOMAAOSwQd5caEGw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/KeoAAOSwSk5caEHH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33607", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chalindsa_68", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 141, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.2}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5328}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1960's Harmony Rocket Triple Pickup Electric Hollowbody Guitar.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Harmony"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 706, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1647900542", "StoreName": "Great Thingys"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 330.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
