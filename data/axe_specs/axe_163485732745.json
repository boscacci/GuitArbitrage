{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is a Gibson Les Paul Studio with hard shell case. It was made in Nashville, Tennessee on June 27th, 2011 at Gibson\u2019s Nashville plant and was production number 241. Some of the features are as follows; \u2022Mahogany neck and body \u2022 22 fret rosewood fretboard w/ pearloid inlays \u2022tunomatic tail bridge \u2022 kluson deluxe vintage tuners \u2022 gold hardware \u2022 Carved figures AA maple top \u2022 EMG Active 81/85 Kerry King edition humbuckers \u2022 Acrylic adjustment knobs \u2022 Gibson locking hardshell case It\u2019s in excellent condition but does have three very small chips and a small surface scuff on in the paint which are considered acceptable according to industry standards. The last three pics of the guitar show the small chips and the scuff is on the back which is usual belt rash style scuffing you see on almost every guitar. The scuff on the back is almost unnoticeable, but does exist. Currently, it has GHS Boomers 10s, but I will include new Elixir polyweb coated strings. I\u2019ll also include a few picks and a brand new microfiber polish cloth as well. I\u2019ve always run either Gibson brite wire 9s or GHS Boomer 10s depending on the need. This guitar has never seen a gig only studio sessions & personal play at my home. I am a non-smoker and it has been in a smoke free environment it\u2019s whole life. I have always kept it very cleaned and polished it with mother\u2019s quick detail spray wax, applied mothers carnauba gold wax, then polished with a microfiber cloth. After that I would use 808 wipes to protect the topcoat from UV exposure or dust and air. It has spent very little time on the wall hanger as Gibson guitar cases are designed to be the very best support and protection for the guitar. The very last two pics shows what accessories could come with the guitar and what will be included if you choose to pull the trigger and buy now. It will be packaged and shipped in another large box as not to draw attention to the actual contents via UPS ground with signature confirmation and the usual tracking & insurance. The guitar will also be detuned to compensate for elevation changes and stress on the neck due to those changes. Please ask any questions before bidding. PayPal is my preferred payment mechanism. US continental bidders only, no returns, and thanks for checking it out. Get it before it gets snatched up, good luck, & as always happy bidding. To clarify any confusion and avoid any issues or misunderstandings here is a breakdown of what I will include at offers below the Buy it now at $750 price. However, but it now at $750 and get well over $100 in free stuff including; a handmade genuine leather padded strap, a Yamaha chromatic tuner, more picks, 3 new Fender Custom Shop braided cables, a guitar wall hanger, a Line6 Sonic port iOS FX pod/portable headphone practice amplifier, and a tuning peg winder. I will sell the guitar for $650.00 US if I do receive an offer in that amount, but it will only include the Gibson guitar, Gibson hard shell case, Elixir strings, picks, and polish cloth. Offers closer to the $700 mark will get more picks, the Yamaha tuner and the Brand new Walker & William\u2019s genuine leather padded guitar strap as well. Buy it now at $750 and get it all and possibly more. (Not possibly more, definitely more!!!!!!!!!!) If there are only certain items you are interested in along with the guitar beyond the included case, strings, picks, and microfiber cloth, make me an offer and send me a message along with the it and I\u2019ll do my best make it happen within reason. Thanks for looking and hope you are the one gets her. She\u2019s super sweet and plays like an absolute dream.", "ItemID": "163485732745", "EndTime": "2019-01-15T19:48:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-13T21:40:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Transparent-Wine-Gold-Harware-EMG-Active-Pickups-HSC-/163485732745", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Montgomery, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634857327458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0IwAAOSwMflcO5kB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RsMAAOSwjrFcO5sX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QUsAAOSwMKxcO5kN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM5MFg5ODM=/z/eEUAAOSw8a9cO5zt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aBQAAOSwuA9cO5kU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0jsAAOSw5wFcO5lb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTg1WDg5MQ==/z/Yo4AAOSwOHpcO51w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rT4AAOSwlfNcO5vY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N-cAAOSwU65cO5vL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ReUAAOSwOnJcO5vW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMwOFgxNjAw/z/4w8AAOSwgb1cPbFG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUyNFgxNjAw/z/4wAAAOSwh99cPbFZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "25136", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spacepope22", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 567, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "z***w", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Studio Transparent Wine, Gold Harware, EMG Active Pickups &HSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Burgundy"]}]}, "HitCount": 75, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
