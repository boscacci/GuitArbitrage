{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A rare genuine Peavey omniac JD,all original with original hardcase. Made in USA at the Peavey custom shop. This one was the pick of my collection as I once had 7 of these. This is the last one I have. I turn 67 shortly and must sell off my collection. You probably have heard a lot about these. They have an Ash body with Birdseye maple neck,5 way selector switch for all the tones you desire. The bridge SD pickup is amazing. The pictures don't do this guitar justice. A very fast neck and the easiest chording and picking guitar I've ever had.This guitar has been stored in my closet since acquisition. A no pet,non smoking environment. If you buy this guitar,you will be surprised for it is in brand new condition,not a mar or scratch.A little pick rash on pickguard. I will include a brand new pic guard that I acquired from peavey with the plastic still on it. When you decide to attach it,you will have a new guitar. The pictures are not the greatest but give you a great sense of the quality.
