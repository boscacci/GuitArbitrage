Brand name: Parker Product: electric guitarsSeries name: PARKER NITEFLY SERIESVariant of: PARKER NITEFLY (NFV1)Dates of manufacture: 1996 to 1998PARKER manufactured the NITEFLY (NFV2) between 1996 and 1998. It was like the NFV1 but with a DiMarzio humbucker and 2 single coil pickups. The NiteFly was Parker's first bolt-on neck guitar. It had a solid contoured maple body and shared many of the Parker Fly's advanced features like a basswood neck reinforced with Parker's patented carbon fiber/glass/epoxy composite. And a fingerboard made of the same smooth, stable and durable composite material as the neck. The NiteFly's 22 jumbo frets were made of spring tempered stainless steel and were precision surface mounted (glued) for accurate intonation and long life. The NiteFly had both magnetic and passive, piezo-transducer pickups.You can buy with confidence when you purchase any item from Accredited Gold and Diamond Brokers.
