{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2017 Squier Vintage Modified Strat HSS. All stock, this model has upgraded neck, rosewood fretboard, and sought after Seymour Duncan Designed pickups. Like new condition, sounds great, everything works. Purchased new from Musiciansfriend in 6/2017, was played very lightly and only inside. No visible scratches or dents. Please see pictures. I have installed a new set of Ernie Ball 2221 Nickel Slinky Strings, cleaned and oiled the fret-board. The guitar has been setup, sounds sweet, and is ready for a new owner.
