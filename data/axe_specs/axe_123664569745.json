{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The Michael Kelly Hybrid Special can deliver screaming electric and sweet acoustic tones from one single guitar. The Hybrid Special is the perfect stage and studio instrument. Instantly switch it from full acoustic tone to ripping electric guitar! Want more? The Hybrid Special can also BLEND both tones together for almost infinite tonal combinations\u201d creating endless variations of a two-axe wall of sound attack! Quickly switch from powerful electric guitar tones to big acoustic guitar sounds, with just the flip of the switch. That is what makes the Hybrid Special a top selling guitar world-wide. Unlock the full potential of your MK Hybrid with a Y-cable. This allows you to send the signal from the magnetic pickups to one amp or channel and the signal from the acoustic tone to another. This lets you perfect your sound. NOTE: Use of Y-cable is optional, use regular cable to a single amp or channel, no problem! This guitar was acquired from a private collector and is like new in every way. The factory protective plastic is still on the rear electronics cover and the factory electronic controls card is still intact. Both guitar and case are in like-new mint condition.
