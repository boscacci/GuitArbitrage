{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Guitar up for auction is an as-new Ibanez RG652AHMFX Prestige in Nebula Green Burst. I purchased this guitar new from an authorized dealer and have only spent a few months occasionally playing it in my home. Guitar has never been gigged with or modified in any way. Only change that has been made is I swapped the stock strings for a much better set of NYXL 9-42's immediately after purchase. This instrument is flawless and free of any nicks, scratches, wear or other signs of use. Everything is in working order and quality is particularly high with this individual RG Prestige. Only reason I've decided to move on from it is due to my very small hands not adapting well to the wide, flat nature of the Wizard neck so I'm going to try something different. Bid with confidence that this is a basically brand new instrument as that is accurate to what you will be receiving. Please e-mail with any questions and I'll provide any additional details you may need. Winning bidder needs to pay using PAYPAL ONLY within three days of auction end. Sorry, no International bidding/shipping. Use this as a great opportunity to pick up an amazing Made in Japan RG Prestige. More information about this model below.
