Parker midi fly guitar guitar comes in original hardshell case there is a air bubble in the outside of the case doesn\u2019t affect the cases ability to protect I\u2019m not sure why it is there but regardless guitar is in near mint condition there is very minor buckle rash on the back which is pictured there are no other scratches, nicks or gouges detected anywhere on the guitar. Serial number 19233 I went online so that I could date the guitar correctly and there\u2019s a little bit of conflicting information out there I\u2019m seeing other guitars listed online that are following both methods of dating I will leave it up to you this is an early five digit serial number and it could either be 1993 or 1999. Comes with original note book and CD also comes with the original sales tag from American music where it was listed for 3250 and sold for 1599. The guitar has great action and plays like a dream.
