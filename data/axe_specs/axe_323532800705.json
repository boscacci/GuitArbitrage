{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Mystery LP Custom Copy...!!! This one is super cool but a bit of a mystery to me and I have been playing and selling guitars for 30 years or so. Brand ? Unknown, Land of origin? Unknown...No serial number, nothing...?Anybody recognize it or have any clues let me know please! What I do know it's older, it's heavy as all heck. It has a brass nut and a tailpiece with fine tuners. Features that were originally en vogue during the late 70's and early 80's. It has a set neck, but most early copies were bolt on. The pots are the smaller dime size with no markings which must be Asian in origin. The tuners are decent sealed type. Look like Pings. The 2 humbucker pickups are generic with no name markings underneath. Like cream DiMarzio copies. One interesting clue there they have 3 screws for height adjustment, not the standard 2. This was also an 80's trend. The headstock logo is a nice tribal inlay with no name or words... It's 24.75\" scale, cool trapezoid inlays, with a nice naturally worn Amber Burst finish.There are holes for a pickguard but it's missing. Standard 2 volume and 2 tone Les Paul controls with Amber speed knobs. I took it in a Trade and everything I have written here is all I know. Again if anybody has an idea please feel free to point me in the right direction. Lots of cosmetic wear from time and usage in all the usual forms, dents, dings, scrapes, scuffs, scratches. By no means a showroom queen, but very cool in appearance none the less.electronics work, there is some fret wear but still a lot of wire left if you are inclined to file them. It will ship in a used Epiphone Hard Case, same cosmetic situation as the guitar basically. A bit worn but still working! Good Luck and enjoy !!!", "ItemID": "323532800705", "EndTime": "2018-11-07T00:49:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T00:49:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Les-Paul-Custom-Copy-Unkown-Brand-Set-Neck-Brass-Nut-Fine-Tuners-/323532800705", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Marietta, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235328007058080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMTI4/z/RecAAOSwLuBb3keP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg5NTM=/z/OPQAAOSwTxhb3keT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTc=/z/VS8AAOSw11Bb3keX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg3MjI=/z/OPoAAOSwTxhb3keZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMTc0/z/mmEAAOSwe~lb3keg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjMw/z/kX8AAOSwUS1b3kek/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDE2/z/VCoAAOSwEtRb3kep/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjU0/z/c3IAAOSwF5Vb3kes/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMDgw/z/EqMAAOSw-ghb3kew/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg5Njk=/z/kY0AAOSwUS1b3kex/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg3MjI=/z/3LYAAOSwcFlb3ke1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMzI5/z/elIAAOSwNo9b3ke3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30066", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gtrpartsmusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1870, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 179.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 179.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Les Paul Custom Copy Unkown Brand / Set Neck - Brass Nut - Fine Tuners ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany & Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unknown?"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["Unknown"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["LP Custom copy"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 StringAmber Burst"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Amber Burst"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 133, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 182.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good playing condition and working electronics.
