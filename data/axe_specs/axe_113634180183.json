{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "UP FOR BIDS: One satin ebony, USED Epiphone Les Paul Traditional Pro Guitar with Gator Flight Pro TSA Series ATA Molded case. I'm primarily a bass guitarist and played this guitar less than a dozen times. It has been stored in the Gator case for over 2 years. Case is top of the line and looks new, but unfortunately I misplaced the keys. Guitar is set up with a nice low action and everything works like it should. It's in absolutely mint shape, with the only mark pictured in the last photo. The Les Paul Traditional PRO comes with Grover machine heads with an 18:1 tuning ratio, Epiphone Alnico Classic Pro +/Classic Pro humbuckers with coil splitting with push/pull pots. Research the price for both the guitar and case on eBay and Reverb, then you'll see that my opening bid is very reasonable. It actually would be a great buy at the Buy It Now price...your choice. I'll be selling many guitars and basses in the future, so keep a lookout. I've been diagnosed with CMT disease and I'm losing my strength in both hands. IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ BEFORE PLACING A BID!
