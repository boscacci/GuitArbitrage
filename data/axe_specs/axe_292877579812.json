{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Model ET 311. Good to very good condition. (ie. not excellent or mint, but better than fair). Guitar has a number of small dings here and there, mostly around the edges and you have to get pretty close to see them. Hopefully the resolution in the pics is good enough for you to see. Neck is straight with proper relief at the 12 fret. It is adjustable via a reinforcing truss rod, but no adjustment needed in my opinion. The guitar plays very nice for a 1960's - 70's budget Japanese issue. Has a new set of strings on it. Action is good and of course can be adjusted up or down by shimming the neck angle and adjusting the bridge. Intonation is good too for a guitar without individually adjustable bridge ramps. Very minor pitting in the chrome in places but would probably buff out. Not sure why, but the tone control works in reverse!! Probably came from the factory that way 50 years ago, but could be fixed if you want to pull the pick guard and reverse the wires on the tone pot. Case has a broken handle and is missing the little accessory door under the neck support. Otherwise in very good condition. Tremolo bar will probably be removed for shipping to facilitate better cushioning of the instrument, so you'll have to put it back on. Please email any questions.
