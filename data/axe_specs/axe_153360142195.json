{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hi Everyone. Here I am selling a genuine Fender SRV Stratocaster body that has been professionally re finished and lightly reliced in Olympic White Nitrocellulose lacquer by MJT Guitars. I actually sold this body 2 weeks ago, but the buyer has failed to contact or pay me, so am reposting it. It comes with all the body hardware pictured, which are all genuine Fender vintage reissue parts except the saddles, which are a set of Raw Vintage Steel saddles. It also comes with a pre wired Switchcraft USA input jack as well as the ground wire connection to the trem claw. It started out life as a 2013 Fender SRV Signature Series Stratocaster, but had some finish damage when I got it, and as it was a left handed trem, I decided to have it refinished by MJT in Olympic White for a Hendrix type vibe. I got it back from MJT about 5 weeks weeks ago and started to assemble it. Unfortunately, the Fender MIJ neck I wanted to use was too wide. I removed the overspray in the neck pocket to aid the fit and as I was fitting it, some of the finish started to chip away. I have showed a close up in the last photo. As I don\u2019t have a spare neck that I can use, I have decided to not go ahead with the build I was planning.", "ItemID": "153360142195", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T00:31:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T07:20:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-MJT-Stratocaster-SRV-Body-/153360142195", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Burwood, NSW", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "COD"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533601421958080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vosAAOSwzExcU~BD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LI0AAOSwakxcU~BJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1g8AAOSw2fpcU~Ah/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTM4/z/vPwAAOSwrXhcU~A7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~9AAAOSwlINcU~BO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "2134", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pcwabdp", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 278, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 362.88, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "AUD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 842}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Australia", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender/MJT Stratocaster SRV Body", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}]}, "HitCount": 136, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "AU", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
