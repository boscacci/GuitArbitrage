{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I think the most stunning PRS top I have ever seen. 2017 Paul Reed Smith McCarty 594 Artist Package Matteo Blue Custom Ordered with Satin Flamed Maple Neck & Flamed Maple Board! Very unique with the maple neck and it is just gorgeous, would we expect less from PRS. It is in excellent to mint condition. Only played sparingly at home. Never out of the house, never gigged. I fell in love with this guitar but am gravitating more toward vintage instruments. This is unique, collectible and simply incredible instrument from the Abalone inlays to the perfect Artist Grade top. Weighs in at 8.4 pounds on my digital scale, feels perfect and well-balanced. Following is material from Paul Reed Smith: The McCarty 594 is a vintage-inspired instrument that is at once incredibly familiar and effortlessly playable. Whether you are looking for rich, authentic, vintage humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet singlecoil sounds, the McCarty 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to the 58/15 LT pickups and push/pull coil taps on the tone controls. The electronics layout, a few key specifications, and PRS craftsmanship combine in the McCarty 594 to create an instrument that plays in tune, is intonated the entire length of the neck, and feels like a guitar that you\u2019ve been playing forever. A few key specifications that contribute to the McCarty 594\u2019s tone and feel are:A 24.594\u201d scale length, just slightly longer than 24.5\u201d and where the model gets its name.58/15 LT pickups. LT, meaning low turns, which give the guitar a warm, clear tone.2 volume and 2 tone controls positioned so players can roll off both volume knobs at the same time.The added versatility of push/pull coil taps for each pickup for more tonal optionsA new Pattern Vintage neck carve, which shares the same width measurements as PRS\u2019s Pattern neck but is slightly thicker front to back and features an asymmetrical carve with a little less meat on the treble side and a little more meat on the bass side of the neck.Tweaked Phase III tuners that have an added set screw that pulls the tuner\u2019s shaft, gear, and worm together (but take the tuner button out of play) to promote tone transfer from the string directly into the guitar itself with as little energy as possible begin detracted.Original artist hardshell case.
