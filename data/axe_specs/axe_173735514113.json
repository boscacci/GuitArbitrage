{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2004 PRS Soapbar ll for sale. I bought it a couple of years ago but now it's time to let it go. It's in good to very good used condition. The color is a gorgeous deep dark Scarlet or red wine color. Has scratches and a few blems from the years. The worst was a chip near the back plate but it has since been repaired. See pics.The electronics have been upgraded to CTS 500k pots and a Switchcraft toggle switch in a 50'S wiring scheme. Started out needing to replace the toggle switch and a pot. Then things grew a little lol. Sounds good though. Frets show a little wear but there is still plenty of life left in them. It's an all around very nice guitar. Also, if interested I have a set of McCarty p-90 pickups I could include (uninstalled) for an additional $75. Please let me know. Questions are welcomed. Will be shipped in a non-PRS gig bag very well packaged. Thank you.", "ItemID": "173735514113", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T06:54:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-11T19:48:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-SE-Soapbar-ll-/173735514113", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cortland, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737355141138080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NDU=/z/AbgAAOSw91JcOOs8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTg=/z/AIwAAOSwnKFcOmV8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3gUAAOSwmvpcOOr2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NDc=/z/294AAOSwVmBcOOs6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iSkAAOSwNXpcOOw1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MTg=/z/VxUAAOSw1rpcOOxG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/d9EAAOSwe~lcOO0k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0NFgxNjAw/z/-e4AAOSwo1lcOmSB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAzN1gxNjAw/z/QQkAAOSwHF1cOmSP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tv8AAOSwm~1cOmVZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFgxNDQw/z/10IAAOSwz3FcO1BU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFgxNDQw/z/MAwAAOSwiwZcO1CV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "44410", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blackdogabk1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 524, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1103}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS SE Soapbar ll", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 402, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "very good used condition, has a few blems", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
