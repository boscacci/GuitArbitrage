{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Iconic 1959 Gibson ES-125 TD with original P-90s. This is one of the easiest playing guitars you will ever have the pleasure of playing. The action is low and very fast. The guitar is hollow and as a result is very light weight. However the combination of the light weight, the legendary tone and construction of the 1959 instruments, the ability of the pickups to change from a clean tone to sparkling highs and then to a dirty growl make for a unique experience. The guitar has less than average wear and crackle. Someone took off the pick guard and changed the tuners and the tail piece. It\u2019s easy enough to replace those if you want to make it a collectible. But if you want to play it and enjoy the music you can leave it as it is.", "ItemID": "223315855708", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T20:13:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T20:13:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-ES-125TD-1959-Electric-Guitar-/223315855708", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chino, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233158557088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NkUAAOSwjiZcM64N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tgAAAOSwXI1cM64U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d5IAAOSw6IdcM64S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YzYAAOSwR3tcM64R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/66gAAOSwEwhcM64L/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pgsAAOSwlfNcM64I/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dUgAAOSwj0BcM64P/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xZUAAOSwvNVcM64W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/p24AAOSwXi9cM64G/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91710", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bbrygb44", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 84, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1825.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1825.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5310}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson ES-125TD 1959 Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1959"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-125TD"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Normal type electric guitar"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 268, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
