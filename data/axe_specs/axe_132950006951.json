Please ask any and all questions PRIOR to bidding. Buyer is responsible for actual shipping and handling and any desired insurance. Payment must be made within 2 days of auction close, Items will be shipped within 3 business days of payment receipt. Comes with the OHSC. Designed to replicate the guitar Synyster plays onstage, the Schecter Synyster Custom Electric Guitar boasts outrageously heavy tone. The Seymour Duncan Invader is designed for the heaviest tones a passive pickup can produce. The Sustainiac Driver/Pickup produces beautiful Humbucker tones when the Sustain switch is off, and works as the Sustainiac Driver when switched On. The Sustainiac Driver creates an infinite feedback sustain of string vibrations by electromagnetic feedback. And of course, this signature guitar still features Synyster's iconic ebony fretboard with Deathbat and \"SYN\" inlays and is finished in white with gold pinstripes.
