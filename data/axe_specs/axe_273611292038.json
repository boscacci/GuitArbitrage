{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "HAGSTROM Viking ll, 12-String Guitar, Ultra Cool Kevlar look. 1965-66It is in very good overall condition considering the age, it has only a few blemishes.(please scrutinize the pictures and again ask questions when in doubt) Everything is customized regarding the looks of this guitar. The hardware on this one is nice and mostly painted black to supplement the Kevlar look. The Kevlar look is of course not original as well. The cavity shielding has been updated too, some wiring had to be resoldered and fixed. However the electronics work but the tone switch seems not to work and the mute switch acts more like a tone switch, the volume potentiometer has been replaced and works flawless.
