{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "THIS IS A DEAN BABY ML SHRED MACHINE! IT'S 3/4 BODY SIZE BUT THE NECK IS THE SAME LENGTH AS A LES PAUL SO IT'S LIGHT WEIGHTWISE BUT HEAVEY WHEN IT COMES TO SOUND AND PLAYABILITY. THE PICKUPS SOUND GREAT AND ACTUALLY WORK FOR ANY STYLE BUT PERFECT FOR A YOUNG UP AND COMING SHREDDER. IT HAS JUMBO FRETS WITH ZERO WEAR. I GUESS YOU COULD POLISH THE FRETS BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. I'VE TRIED TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE NICKS AND SCRATCHES EVEN THOUGH OVERALL IT LOOKS GREAT. IT HAS A SCRATCH ACROSS THE VOLUME KNOB THAT YOU CAN SEE IN THE PHOTO PLUS SOME NICKS AT BOTH ENDS OF THE V-SHAPE BUT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT. THERE'S ALSO A HAIRLINE CRACK AT THE NECK JOINT BUT THAT'S ON HALF OF THE BOLT-ON NECKS OUT THERE. EVERYTHING WORKS ON THIS GUITAR PLUS IT STAYS IN TUNE WITH THE NICE BLACK TUNERS THAT STILL HAVE THE PLASTIC ON THEM A LIKE NEW BABY ML. I'M OLD SO THIS GUITAR LOOKS SORT OF FUNNY ON ME BUT I LOVE THIS GUITAR. I'VE ONLY USED IT AT PRACTICE A FEW TIMES BUT TOOK TOO MUCH FLACK FROM FELLOW BANDMATES. HAHA. ALSO TRYING TO NARROW IT DOWN TO EIGHT GUITARS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTER. DON'T SEE MANY OF THESE UNITS OUT THERE SO IF YOU'RE A SHREDDER ON A BUDGET YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS SILVER BEAUTY. IT'S THE SAME GUITAR AS THE DEAN DIMEBAG DARRELL LIGHTNING BOLT BABY ML BUT WITHOUT THE LIGHTNING BOLT DECAL. I'LL DO RETURNS IF THE BUYER PAYS SHIPPING BUT YOU WON'T RETURN THIS ONE I ASSURE YOU.
