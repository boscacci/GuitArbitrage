Looks amazing due to the natural aging of the lacqer and will only continue to get better! I purchased this beauty new from Wildwoods in Colorado. It plays and sounds amazing! The only reason I am selling is because I am in a country band now and I don't get to use it due to the style of music we play. There are No scratches or dings and it has absolutely 100% fret life! There are zero fret buzzes due to the factory plek job and the action can go as low as you would ever want it. The Flying V 120 takes off with a select mahogany body cut to the legendary space-aged angles of the original. The glued-in mahogany neck is carved to the fast, slim profile that so many rockers love, with a bound one-piece Grade-A rosewood fingerboard with frets over binding and dot inlays. The traditional \u201carrowhead\u201d headstock has a white plastic truss-rod cover with Gibson logo, and there\u2019s a commemorative \u201c120th Anniversary\u201d banner at the 12th fret. Vintage tones with contemporary performance come from Alnico V Burst Bucker Pro Rhythm and Lead pickups, made in the image of the original PAF humbuckers with mismatched coils for characteristic bite and depth. A chrome Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece partner with Grover\u2122 Kidney Button tuners for smooth, efficient performance. The Flying V 120 comes finished in high-gloss nitrocellulose lacquer, all protected by an elegant brown hardshell case.", "ItemID": "143125012846", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T15:51:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-10T01:27:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Flying-V-120th-Anniversary-Classic-White-only-120-made-/143125012846", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Erie, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431250128468080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4Njc=/z/VmoAAOSw~LtbdZJ3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/5iUAAOSwMjZbdZKJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/0YoAAOSwqo5bdZKd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/OzAAAOSwNqFbdZKy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/x08AAOSwgMBbdZLC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/clYAAOSwXn5bdZLW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/dQUAAOSwhE9bdZLt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/usAAAOSwpnhbdZMI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/pwcAAOSwd~ZbdZgt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "16504", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rudybaddog", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 284, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "x***x", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 95}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Flying V\u00a0120th Anniversary Classic White (only 120 made!)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Classic white"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Flying V"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2014"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 445, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition!
