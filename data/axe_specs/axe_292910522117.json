{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Beautiful instrument in near-mint condition. It has always been stored in a controlled temperature with appropriate humidity. I've included the original sales sheet from the dealer (see pictures) which has all the tech details. This guitar has the 3S upgrade (electronics and pickup configuration). If you look closely you can see that the paint is somewhat translucent, which allows the wood grain to be seen faintly. The spec sheet calls it a \"thin skin\" vintage blone lacquer. It's a very classy looking guitar. Comes in the original hardshell case with all the case candy. It has a gold bridge cover that I've never even unwrapped. Case is in perfect condition inside and out. The only imperfections are two hairline cracks in the paint on the back side of the body (see pic), which you cannot feel when you run your finger across them, they are barely visible. The picture captures them quite well and makes them appear more noticeable than they are in person. Personal Note from Seller: I love love LOVE this guitar, it's been one of my favorites in my collection for years. I'm downsizing my studio and selling off some of the pricier items that don't get played as much these days. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to send me a message. I want this guitar to go to the right buyer.
