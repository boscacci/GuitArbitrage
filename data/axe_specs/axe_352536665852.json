{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! shipping to the lower 48 states.I will not ship anywhere else,Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier/SX Tele. The Canadien maple 21 fret neck is from a Squier SX VTG Series and has zero fret wear on the jumbo frets . High Gloss finish and is very high quality neck. The very cool Gloss Vintage body is from a Squier Affinity Series and has a small chip on the back edge I tried to show in the pictures and and features a top modern style six saddle fixed bridge. Besides the chips just light surface scratches. The pickups and electronics are all original. I did upgrade the tone capacitor with a .022uf Orange Drop style capacitor. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. Action is good and could probably lowered even more. Guitar plays,looks,and sounds great except for the chip. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented.
