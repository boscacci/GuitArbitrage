{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Godin Guitar SD 22 Fret Maple Neck 2 SC+H`B PUs Deep Blue Fitted Padded Fender Deluxe Case Fine Lightly played Condition Really in super condition. I don't say that in many past guitar sales! Only Most minute of pick swirls, No edging or head stock nicks, No back rash BETTER than an GC Demonstrator as they always have a nick or ding. Relisted due to non payment Also have replaced the little black locking Strap hardware with full sz. Chrome ones will update photos ATTENTON All! Am deleting most of my Guitar Collection. Have listed or will list 3-5 Assorted Instruments Electric and Acoustic. Most are Truly excellent or even near mint as I don't gig or anything most were never out of my home. I'm pricing them below any book value and have assurance of excellent feedback!Be aware they are also REVERBING So if want it, Should take immediate action Super thin neck Quite light (Poplar Maple Body ) Almost perfect condition, no fret wear. Just minute pick swirls, No edging or headstock nicks. Fender Carry case is also in super condition with reinforced bottom fits like glove. 22 Fret and 24.75 scale Plays great and has lots of unplugged tone. The Balanced GS Pu's these by Godin few people replace, Guitar is light and has the later Vibrato Block with slip in secure bar. I have it tuned and balanced as well as any std. Fender. (3 springs)KOOL Little Mystery back Door? This Guit is std. passive Wiring BUT has a precise locking little door with no wiring, cool little stash box for picks even a string or? I think as this was an end run on the Performance line they simply milled the bodies for multi application guitars Several Listed currently are same?
