{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a one of a kind and very rare Mcloughlin Custom Relic series guitar with a beautiful hand made in USA Alder guitar body in thin three tone sunburst nitro lacquer finish loaded with left handed Klein Epic 1957 reissue pickups. This finish has lots of lacquer checking with light relic wear. This is a rare and discounted Custom Relic series guitar that is no longer being offered by McLoughlin guitars, and it is based on SRV's #1 strat.It features 1963 specs with all cloth wiring with CTS pots, switch craft jack, vintage CRL switch, .047uf Russian capacitor, all vintage spec cloth wire by hand, with a 3-ply aged mint green pickguard aged in nitro lacquer. The full Callaham assembly bridge plate with matching saddles is pro-aged and features a full mass Callaham block as well.The Fender licensed made in USA maple neck features a rare round lam dark, tight grained Brazilian RW veneer fretboard with 9.5\" radius, Fender 6105 fretwork, and a large C back profile with .91\"/.97\" thickness. It has real aged clay dots with 50/50 split, and very authentic looking relic work.It's a super comfortable neck with a 41mm aged pro-installed bone nut, truss rod adjustment at heel, Fender Kluson Deluxe tuners, and an all pro-aged nitro finish with vintage style decal (this guitar is a replica, it is not a Fender). It has a pro set up by Phil Jacoby of Philitone Guitars.This is the most high-end custom replica of a Fender strat that I've ever seen, and it has no expense spared with a value of over $2700, with over $2K in materials value alone. Weighs a light 7.3 lb and ships in a free deluxe hard shell case. Compare to sellers on Reverb asking $2500-$2700 for custom MJT guitars. This guitar is very high quality and similar to what you might find on a $4,000 Fender Custom Shop model. This guitar will be securely packed and shipped in a free deluxe hard shell case, with full insurance and signature confirmation.I offer fast same-day handling and 13+ years on eBay.
