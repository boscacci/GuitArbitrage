The fine minds at Jackson put their heads together and created the next evolution of innovative guitars, melding sound, playability and ultra-modern style into a unique music machine that redefines metal prowess. Premium features include a resonant mahogany body with a poplar burl top and a one-piece through-body maple neck with scarf joint and graphite reinforcement rods to provide stiffness and stability, guarding against temperature- and humidity-induced bending and warping. Its 12\"-16\" compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets is designed for highly technical light speed playing - more curved by the nut for comfortable chording, it flattens out as you move up the speedy neck (with hand-rubbed oil back finish) for increasingly fast playing speed and wide bends without fretting out. Chosen specifically for their incredible sound, a pair of modern Seymour Duncan Distortion humbucking pickups drives this guitar's voice, combining for highly balanced, flexible tone, with plenty of high output for pristine cleans and snarling distortion. Single volume and tone controls shape the pickups' output, which can be further refined with the three-way pickup toggle switch for the precise voice required to bring your musical vision to life. Dive and soar expressively with the Floyd Rose 1000 series double-locking tremolo bridge system, recessed for pick hand comfort and providing laser-accurate intonation and ultra-stable tuning. Jackson has a history of adding striking style to its high-performance instruments and this axe is no exception. Available in Aqua Shok or Desert Sand, the SL2P MAH is completed with alumiloid piranha inlays, black nickel hardware, Dunlop strap locks, sealed die-cast tuners and a Jackson pointed 6-in-line matching headstock.FEATURES25.5\" scale lengthMahogany body with a poplar burl topOne-piece through-body maple neck with graphite reinforcement and scarf joint12\"- 16\" compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets and alumiloid piranha tooth inlaysSeymour Duncan Distortion humbucking pickups (TB-6 bridge/SH-6N neck)Single volume and tone controls, plus three-way toggle switchRecessed Floyd Rose FRT-O5000 double-locking tremolo bridge systemJackson sealed die-cast tunersDunlop dual-locking strap buttonsAvailable in Aqua Shock or Desert Sand with black nickel hardwareJackson pointed 6-in-line matching headstockSPECIFICATIONSBody MaterialMahogany with Poplar Burl TopBody FinishSatinNeck1-Piece Through-Body Maple Speed Neck with Graphite Reinforcement and Scarf JointNeck FinishOiledFingerboardEbony, 12\" - 16\" (304.8mm to 406.4mm) Compound RadiusFrets24, JumboPosition InlaysAlumiloid PiranhaNut MaterialFloyd Rose FRT-O5000 LockingNut Width1.69\" (42.93mm)Tuning MachinesJackson Sealed Die-Cast LockingScale Length25.5\" (647.70mm)BridgeFloyd Rose FRT-O5000 Double-Locking Tremolo (Recessed)PickguardNoPickupsSeymour Duncan TB-6 Distortion (Bridge) Seymour Duncan SH-6N Distortion (Neck)Pickup Switching3-Way Toggle: Position 1.
