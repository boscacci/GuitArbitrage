{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "- 1 piece quartersawn maple- Rosewood fretboard- Offset abalone dots - 22 fret, 25.5\" scale- 1 5/8\" nut width (R2)- 2 3/16\" heel width (strat pocket) Neck came off an early 90's M-II. These were only made for a few years before they switched to 24 fret necks. Original holes were filled with 1/4\" rock maple dowels. A pilot bit was plunged too deep and left a ~1mm diameter hole in the fretboard. Issue is purely cosmetic and easily fixed. Neck is straight, truss rod works, frets have very little wear outside the first few frets. Headstock has scratches, dings, and spots where it was touched up, but overall very good shape. Cosmetics aside, it is a very well made, solid neck. Comes with original nut, string retainer, and truss rod cover. No tuners.", "ItemID": "264207976959", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T00:36:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-21T19:41:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-M-II-Guitar-Neck-22-Frets-Reverse-Headstock-Early-90s-Japan-/264207976959", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Saint Clair Shores, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2642079769598080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4OVgxNjAw/z/VZsAAOSwaAtcbvpF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzczWDE2MDA=/z/YHgAAOSw6PtcbvpD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzI2WDE2MDA=/z/x3YAAOSw3qVcbvpD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/cdMAAOSwM7lcbvpE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/zmcAAOSwtxtcbvpF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/9h0AAOSwPF9cbvpF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48082", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nickguitar91", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 117, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 325.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 590}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP M-II Guitar Neck 22 Frets Reverse Headstock Early 90's Japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["M-II"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 120, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
