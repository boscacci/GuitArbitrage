Product Description The LTD MFA-600 Matt Devries Electric Guitar features a solid alder body with a maple set-thru neck. The set-thru neck joint reaches deep into the body wood to maximize contact, assuring a tremendous amount of string vibration transfers throughout the entire electric guitar. Those vibrations are sent to your amp by a single, beefy active EMG-81 pickup at the bridge position. To keep your signal clean and mean, ESP has limited the controls to a single volume knob. The MFA-600 neck features a fast U-shaped profile and an ebony fingerboard with 24 extra jumbo frets, perfect for high-speed playing. Black nickel hardware completes the metal-ready look. Rhythm guitarist Matt Devries, along with Chimaira, have been taking the world of metal by storm since the early 00s, and show no signs of stopping.
