Everything works as expected, guitar feels and plays nicely.If you have any questions or need additional photos message me. Below is a description of the guitar from Sweetwater when the guitar was still being manufactured.------Continuing the Paul Reed Smith legacy, the SE Torero takes two giant steps toward bridging the gap between the highly-acclaimed PRS SE series and their premier solidbody masterpieces. The minimalist fretboard free of inlays offsets the beauty of the SE Torero's flame maple top. Underneath, solid mahogany flanks a neck though body that leads all the way up an ultra-fast 25-1/2\" 24-fret wide-thin neck. Its highly glossy body, neck, and headstock are all bound for a truly polished look and feel. But it's the accoutrements that set the SE Torero apart from other SE models.The PRS SE Torero's dressed to play with the big boys. Featuring two super-hot EMG pickups, this beautiful guitar is ready to tear it up \u2014 perfect for classic rock leads and the maddening demands of modern metal. A genuine Floyd Rose tremolo complements its wide thin neck and EMG picks, making the Torero a dream guitar for any guitarist with a vividly aggressive playing style or penchant for taking the spotlight. And any guitarist will appreciate the smooth feel and fine response of this masterfully crafted instrument.Paul Reed Smith SE Torero Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:Color: Black / GrayBody: Mahogany with flame maple veneerBinding: Body, neck, and headstockNeck: MapleNeck shape: Wide-thin carveNeck-through-body designScale length: 25-1/2\"No. of frets: 24Fingerboard: Ebony (no inlays)Tremolo: Floyd RosePickups: EMG 81 and 85 humbuckersControls: Volume and tone, 3-way selector toggle", "ItemID": "183563130152", "EndTime": "2018-12-06T16:26:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-01T16:26:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-PRS-SE-Torero-Black-Gray-/183563130152", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fenton, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835631301528080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PEgAAOSwRrlb-XNK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0~oAAOSwXitb-XNO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4ZAAAOSw1hJb-XNR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZmMAAOSwGUpb-XNU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bS0AAOSwPXFb-XNZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/W0MAAOSwTiVb-XNb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "63026", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "notoad2000", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 9, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 355.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 355.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 94}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith (PRS) SE Torero Black / Gray", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 159, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 360.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "159805863", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
