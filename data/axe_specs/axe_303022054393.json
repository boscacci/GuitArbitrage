{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I have a beautiful 2015 Les Paul Studio Deluxe III EX Electric Guitar for sale. This Les Paul raises the bar with the Super '57 and Classic '57 humbucking pickups, which are mounted on a carved maple top with a mahogany back. Both pickups offer coil splitting for single-coil sounds and a boost circuit via push/push switching in the volume controls. Straight Split\u009d coil-splitting offers pure single coil tone and differs from LP Standards and Studios that have a Super Tap\u009d coil-tap, which still has a small amount of humbucking. The boost circuit has a user-adjustable 10-dB boost for added power and frequency range for solos, single-note picking and dirty chording (depending on amp settings) and features true bypass that disengages the boost completely, ensuring pure passive Les Paul tone. The Les Paul Studio Deluxe features a traditional-spec SlimTaper '60s neck that offers a comfortable playing experience for which Les Paul models of that era are famous. The hardware is finished in chrome including Gibson's pioneering tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece. The Les Paul Studio Deluxe is dependable, affordable, and is built without any compromises. Notable features A user-adjustable 10-dB boost for added power and frequency range for solos, single-note picking and dirty chording (depending on amp settings) Traditional '60s-style neck shape True bypass: disengaging boost completely removes active circuit, ensuring pure passive Les Paul tone Super '57 humbucking pickup in the bridge position. Classic 57 humbucking pickup in the neck position Easy-to-use push/push pots engage coil-splits and boost circuit Straight Split\u009d coil-splitting offers pure single coil tone Non-locking Grover tuners Includes period correct hardshell This Les Paul is used but is in near mint original condition. It has been checked over by the guitar tech at my local Guitar Center and has received a complete bill of health. It has brand new #9 strings on it and plays beautifully. You will not be disappointed.
