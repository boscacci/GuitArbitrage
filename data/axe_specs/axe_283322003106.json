{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2000 PRS Pre-Lawsuit Singlecut Soapbar Gold Top w/ OHSC 2000 PRS Pre-Lawsuit Singlecut Soapbar Gold Top PRS released their Singlecut model back in 2000 to great fan fair among guitar players who were fans of the Les Paul style guitar. The Singlecut became so popular that Gibson sued PRS guitars and forced them to cease production of all singlecut models in 2004. PRS ultimately won the lawsuit in 2006 and was able to resume production and the Sinclecut has remained a staple in the PRS lineup ever since. This Singlecut Soapbar is an incredibly rare example of the Singlecut model with P90 soapbar pickups. They never really officially made a Singlecut soapbar from what we can tell so this guitar was probably either a one-off or possibly made for an artist or employee. It is in excellent condition other than some tarnish on the hardware and a couple small dings and it is a phenomenal player. The back is one piece of mahogany and it has some weight to it giving it a ton of sustain. It includes the original hardshell case, bird hang tag and all original case candy. This is a really cool axe that would make a fine addition to any collection.\u00a0 Features Made in the USA in 2000 Pre-Lawsuit Original Singlecut Model Gold Top\u00a0 Includes Original Hardshell Case and All Case Candy Ryan Fowler's Guitar Experience is one of Maryland's premier brick and mortar guitar shops.
