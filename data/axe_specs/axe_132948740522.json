Description below: PRS prides themselves in offering a versatile and affordable electric guitar that combines striking aesthetics and exceptional comfort. Don't allow the simple design to fool you, these guitars are coveted for their refined tonal characteristics and ease of playing. Crafted in Korea, the guitar's flamed maple top and mahogany back are perfectly highlighted by PRS' signature royal blue gloss finish.The stock humbuckers are perfectly balanced and dynamically responsive when driven at full volume, and thanks to the bright qualities of the maple top, things still stay articulate when the tone is rolled back on the stock 500k pots. The maple neck has their signature \"Wide, Thin\" neck profile shape, which roughly translates to a medium C with slight shoulders and consistent depth as you move up the bird inlaid rosewood fretboard. The 25\" scale on this particular guitar offers a bound fingerboard and jumbo frets with virtually no wear and their full, factory height. The headstock features stock PRS tuners that offers both reliability and tuning stability. Even with the stock PRS-designed tremolo bridge, the tuners have no problem keeping up with everything from the most aggressive dive bomb to the slightest tap of the bar. The guitar is currently set up for the bridge to be floating.", "ItemID": "132948740522", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T22:56:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-10T22:56:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-PRS-SE-Custom-24-Amber-Burst-Quilt-Top-Guitar-RARE-/132948740522", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Leonardo, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329487405228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQz/z/chkAAOSwyElcYKar/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQz/z/P7wAAOSwCrtcYKar/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQz/z/ZGYAAOSwQpVcYKar/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PC0AAOSwxNBcYKas/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/250AAOSwC29cYKas/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2RgAAOSwOylcYKaq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07737", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bryguy580", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 145, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 530.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 530.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 12}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith PRS SE Custom 24 Amber\u00a0Burst Quilt Top Guitar RARE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 578, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 540.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
