{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hi! This auction is for a Paul Reed Smith Zach Myers SE Electric Guitar, in a beautiful Trampas Green finish. I hand selected this model from a famous Midwest guitar store known for its great service, for its unusual flame pattern on the maple top. I have owned the guitar for about eight months, and it has only been played a couple times. It has never left the house, never been gigged, and was always stored in its case away from potential damage. I am a middle-aged guitar hobbyist, and I keep my guitars in pristine condition. This guitar is like brand new in every way. There are no scratches, dings, etc. Even the gloss finish is like a mirror. I turned the truss rod cover over because I don\u2019t know who Zach Myers is, but you can easily turn it back over to read his name. It comes with original case, and all paperwork. Please let me know if you have any questions. Please only US and Canada bidders. Shipping to the Lower 48 States will be a flat rate $40 via UPS Ground. Thanks for looking and have a great day!", "ItemID": "163567338758", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T00:27:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-26T18:02:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-Zach-Myers-SE-Electric-Guitar-Trampas-Green-Perfect-/163567338758", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tariffville, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635673387588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qIAAAOSwHGFcdX2p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G90AAOSwcgNcdX2n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b3kAAOSwciNcdX2r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/etoAAOSwJBhcdX2s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EuwAAOSwbrZcdX2o/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/m0wAAOSwZjpcdX2n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OVgxNjAw/z/TYUAAOSwz4xcdX2t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9DwAAOSwck9cdX2s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SA4AAOSwizpcdX2x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06081", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rsm66wd", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 166, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 21}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith Zach Myers SE Electric Guitar, Trampas Green - Perfect!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}]}, "HitCount": 138, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 520.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
