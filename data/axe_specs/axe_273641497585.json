{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is one of the cooler Artist Series Samicks I\u2019ve seen - and it\u2019s been modified to perfection. This particular guitar has a fancy wood top, and has been upgraded with a pair of Seymour Duncan humbuckers (a distortion at the bridge and jazz in the neck position). The wiring has also been modified - the switch has been removed from the circuit and the tone pot pulls up for more variety (I believe it is a series/parallel switch but am not sure). Sounds killer, goes from twang to clean, rich chords to crunch and everything in between. The Grover tuners keep everything in tune, and the guitar plays awesome. Neck is straight and truss rod works as it should. Note that there is some wear (the worst of it is pictured - specifically the small gouge below the bridge) - this guitar is a player through and through, and the wear is all honest player wear. Didn\u2019t bother me in the least, but I rarely find myself using anything but my SG for tracks these days (I\u2019m mainly a bass player) so would rather see this one go somewhere it will be used. Sold as is but guaranteed to be as described. Does not come with a case but will be well packed for shipping. I recently received my first negative feedback in over 20 years on eBay. I\u2019m happy to discuss the situation with anyone who is interested. My feedback and reputation (and happy buyers) are of the utmost importance to me. Of course also happy to respond to whatever questions prospective buyers may have. Bidding starts at a penny, and there is no reserve. Happy bidding!", "ItemID": "273641497585", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T21:03:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T21:03:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samick-Artist-Series-Telecaster-Duncan-s-Grover-No-Reserve-Free-Shipping-/273641497585", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Clark, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736414975858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0h8AAOSw8U9cMRlq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZtEAAOSwIbtcMRll/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMyNlgxNjAw/z/W68AAOSwjwZcMRln/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mdIAAOSwZ2FcMRlr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZRcAAOSw6S9cMRlj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzMFgxNjAw/z/qKsAAOSwG6tcMRlo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/ecMAAOSwGD1cMRlp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/W30AAOSwoPpcMRlh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hnIAAOSw1qhcMRli/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07066", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "french-vanilla", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 149, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 90.9}, "BidCount": 22, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 144}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Samick Artist Series Telecaster With Duncan\u2019s Grover - No Reserve, Free Shipping", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Samick"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 391, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
