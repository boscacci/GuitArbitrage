{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "What I have for sale is a 90's Samick Radio Ten in good used condition.These guitars are getting popular for their \"workhorse\" appeal, as they are very well made, quality instruments.The specs are standard from what I can tell:The body is alder, neck is 2pc maple and definitely on the beefy side, the radius is flat probably 14\" or 16\" for sure.Like the neck, the frets are beefy though they are also beginning to show some wear.There is one small crack on the fretboard at the 22nd fret (last picture), which is only about as thick as a finger nail, hasn't changed or anything since I've had it. Would be an easy repair with some laquer or super glue, etc. The pickups and electronics, to my understanding, are stock.When I got the guitar it had already been refinished to a metallic grey with the dragon head airbrushed on it as well.The refinishing is definitely a professional job, and is properly covered in poly as well.This being an older guitar, there are definitely some wear and dings on various points of the body, but nothing either major or impeding on the structure of the instrument.Hasn't left my house since I got it, and was properly set up while in my care, Shipping is always set to $50, but if shipping costs less, than I will gladly refund you the difference.Will be packaged securely and shipped promptly upon payment. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.Thank you for your time!", "ItemID": "372549657110", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T05:14:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-27T23:00:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samick-Blues-Saraceno-Radio-10-Electric-Guitar-MIK-Alder-Maple-Neck-Refinished-/372549657110", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Springdale, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3725496571108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fKcAAOSweiFcJVct/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UroAAOSwPWtcJVdX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BIQAAOSw~HFcJVdu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/l6AAAOSwLr1cJVeJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/neQAAOSwoDFcJVeq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xVMAAOSw29JcJVfY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/G84AAOSwQ9lcJVhV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rYQAAOSwTxJcJVh7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/A6YAAOSwFSNcJVlJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HSEAAOSwqiJcJVlE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UeEAAOSwFGNcJVkz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NFgxNjAw/z/0iMAAOSwY4JcJ5uj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "72764", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "zoinkernaut", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 134, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 170.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 170.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***6", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 34}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Samick Blues Saraceno Radio 10 Electric Guitar MIK Alder Maple Neck (Refinished)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Samick"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Date of Creation", "Value": ["Early 90&#39;s"]}, {"Name": "Type", "Value": ["Solid Body"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Original/Reproduction", "Value": ["Original"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Color Refinish/Repaint"]}, {"Name": "Color", "Value": ["Gray"]}]}, "HitCount": 380, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
