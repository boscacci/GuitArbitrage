{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is an 2018 Epiphone Les Paul Frampton Pro electric guitar. The neck was broken completely off at the headstock. The guitar was never played, brand new prior to this. It was a fairly clean break with minimal splintering. Some paint chipped out and was filled in. Franklin Tite Bond was used to glue the headstock back into place. Its a strong repair and aligned properly. You can barely feel the crack line when playing. It\u2019s obvious however when visually inspecting. Some cloudiness in the finish around the repaired area. It\u2019s totally solid now and will not cause issues. Glued seams are often much stronger than the wood itself. The repair doesn\u2019t affect the playability as it plays extremely well. Overall, the guitar is in excellent playing shape. The finish is excellent but I won\u2019t say mint. The action is pretty low and the neck profile is a thicker. The neck is straight and truss rod functions as it should. The frets are in mint shape. All electronics are checked and sound great. The body lightweight from the chambering and it also adds a loudness and resonance. All factory accessories are included. I will ship well packaged in a proper box with strings detuned. Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "202571949906", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T21:41:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T00:23:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-Epiphone-Peter-Frampton-Les-Paul-Pro-Electric-Guitar-Black-Repaired-/202571949906", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025719499068080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/A3cAAOSwtINcQ~uo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nqMAAOSwMQ1cQ~uZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sLAAAOSwws5cQ~ui/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eokAAOSwaaNcQ~ue/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jo0AAOSwIABcQ~ug/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IbYAAOSwhfRcQ~ul/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NVwAAOSwWDlcQ~ut/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/w-cAAOSwIbtcQ~uc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uHMAAOSw3-9cQ~us/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pZYAAOSwnKFcQ~uq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/d8MAAOSw-yJcQ~uj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cIYAAOSw1jpcQ~um/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6621, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 4}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2018 Epiphone Peter Frampton Les Paul Pro Electric Guitar Black Repaired", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Frampton"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 953, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
