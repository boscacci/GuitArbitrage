{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Welcome to our NO RESERVE auction! You are bidding on a NICE 2003 Gibson Les Paul Standard 50s Neck in Honey Burst finish. Model number from Gibson is LP5FHBNH1. Gibson customer service verified the model/production date/serial number/color in an email to me. Condition:The guitar is a player but in good shape overall. There are various scratches on the head stock. There are a few buckle marks from playing on the back. Nothing too noticeable until the light hits it. There are a couple of tiny dings on the top of the guitar. Again, nothing major for a player but wanted to note it. There is a deep ding on the reverse of the neck (see pic) There are no deep scratches/gouges/cracks in the finish (other than the one on the neck). The frets have light playing wear. The truss rod turns freely as it should. One of the truss rod cover holes is split but screws down as it should. The guitar weighs 9lbs 8ozs. The guitar/case does come from a smoking household so if you have a super sensitive sniffer this might not be the guitar for you. The TKL/Gibson case is nice inside. The outside is dusty and marked up. See pic. Truss rod wrench, pre-pack checklist, and manual are included. To recap, this is not a case queen, but a nice condition player. I'm probably understating the condition to make sure there isn't any high expectations. It has scratches and small dings but still in great shape overall. Electronics work as they should and it sounds great. Please email me if you have any questions or need additional pictures. There is no \"buy it now\" price. FREE Shipping will either be USPS Priority Mail or FedEx ground (lower 48 states and no PO BOXES please) depending on final destination and weight of package. Payment is due within 3 days of auction end.", "ItemID": "153351379135", "EndTime": "2019-01-29T16:30:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T16:30:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2003-Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-LP5FHBNH1-50s-Neck-OHSC-Honey-Burst-FREE-SHIP-/153351379135", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Martinsburg, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533513791358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/inQAAOSw8U9cSeR4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/H6wAAOSwYTtcSeR6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/hIsAAOSwmfhcSeR9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/8ckAAOSwSe5cSeSB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/smcAAOSwzFhcSeSD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/V9UAAOSwuQhcSeSG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/94wAAOSwiJZcSeSI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/0HcAAOSw9g1cSeSK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/0H0AAOSw9g1cSeSN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/PqoAAOSwPYRcSeSP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/u70AAOSwZ-9cSeST/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/tmQAAOSwhY9cSeSg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "25404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "paradisepawnwvmartinsburg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2851, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 23, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1351.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1351.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 368}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2003 Gibson Les Paul Standard LP5FHBNH1 '50s Neck OHSC Honey Burst FREE SHIP!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["GIBSON"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["LP5FHBNH1"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard '50s neck"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Honey Burst"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2003"]}]}, "HitCount": 1182, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1376.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "AL", "AD", "AT", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "FR", "DE", "GI", "GR", "GG", "HU", "IS", "IE", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LI", "LT", "LU", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "NL", "NO", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SJ", "SE", "CH", "UA", "GB", "VA", "AF", "AM", "AZ", "BD", "BT", "CN", "GE", "IN", "JP", "KZ", "KR", "KG", "MV", "MN", "NP", "PK", "LK", "TJ", "TM", "UZ"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
