You have to look really hard to find any imperfections \u2013 it\u2019s pretty close to being new! The pickups have been upgraded to: Bridge: Fender Custom Shop '51 Nocaster Tele Bridge Neck: Seymour Duncan 59 Neck SH-1N \u2013 the cover was added and is not soldered on. It is a two conductor. I also replaced the original tone cap with a Mallory \u201corange drop\u201d. The only thing I want to bring to your attention is that in the middle position, the pickups are currently \u201cout of phase\u201d. Since the neck pickup is two conductors, I wasn\u2019t able to get the polarity correct. So please be aware of that \u2013 great if you like that \u201cGreenie Tone\u201d. You may be able to get in back in phase by reversing the wires on the bridge pickup but if my memory is correct, there is a separate (third) ground wire on it and that may have to be disconnected. My inclination on the MIM (Mexican) guitars is to part them out and sell them but this plays really great, has great tone, and the note ring nicely over the entire fingerboard. I just hardly ever play it and want the funds for another purchase. Includes the original Fender gig bag. Weighs 7lbs 8oz. Note: in the picture that shows the side of the neck where it meets the body \u2013 there is a mark right after the 19th fret \u2013 this is not a crack, it is a flame pattern in the maple grain.The guitar will be shipped with insurance and will require a signature - I will cover these cost and the buyer will be responsible for the shipping costs. Please email with any questions. Shipping will be Calculated. PayPal accepted. The item will ship when the checks clear. PayPal ships right away. Payment MUST BE RECEIVED within 7-10 DAYS of AUCTIONS END. Check my feedback and bid with confidence. Thank you for looking and good luck! From Fender The Fender Special Edition Deluxe Ash Telecaster features the best of the old and the new: a butterscotch blonde finish, a fast-action maple neck, cast/sealed machine heads, two classic single-coil pickups, and a 3-barrel string-thru-body bridge.
