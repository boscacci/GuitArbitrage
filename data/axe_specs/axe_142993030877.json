{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "VINTAGE 1973 GIBSON USA LES PAUL DELUXE !!! KALAMAZOO PRODUCTION!!! \u201cEXCELLENT PLUS CONDITION\u201d You are bidding on a Beautiful, NEAR MINT, 1973 Vintage Gibson USA made Les Paul Deluxe, Serial Number 113XXX, built in the Kalamazoo factory where we all know produced the best guitars for quality and craftsmanship. Finished in a gorgeous light Tobacco Burst, and weighing in at around 8.5 pounds according to my scales. This beautiful guitar has been well looked after with only light wear and tear which you would forgive considering it is a 45 Years Old Vintage. It retains all the gloss of a new guitar, and definitely a collector grade instrument that has aged beautifully with plenty of vintage vibe. The front of the body is super clean, even the chrome finish is in pristine condition. The neck is in superb condition, smooth, straight and with original frets. The back is also in excellent condition, some slight markings underneath the body and light surface marks which can be forgiven given the age of this vintage. 100% ORIGINAL, No Excuses, Issues, Breaks, Modifications, Routing or Repairs, just a beautiful guitar to play with striking good looks and plenty of vintage tone. You will NOT be disappointed with this guitar as you will not find better. Turn up your amp and you will simply be amazed how it screams with tonal versatility that only a true vintage can produce. NOTHING COMPARES!!! Also included in this auction is the original Gibson Hard Case as pictured also in excellent condition. \u201cCheck My Positive Feedback and Bid with Confidence from a Trusted Seller\u201d \u201cFeel Free to Email Me With Any Questions\u201d Only Bid if you intend to Pay as ALL SALES ARE FINAL and SOLD AS IS.
