I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Jackson \"Custom Shack San Dimas Style\". The aftermarket 22 Fret maple neck has zero fret wear ,and has smooth satin finish. It is a beefy C shape neck. The very cool Gloss Black Jackson Body is from the JS Series and it looks close to new with no chips,dings,or heavy scratches,does have a few light surface scratches. Guitar features a big block two point tremolo , push in whammy bar. Set of HMV Hot White Hex Pole Humbuckers. Guitar has a push/pull tone control so you can split the humbuckers into single coils. Along with the three way switch this gives you six different pickup combinations. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound killer on this guitar. The capacitor has been upgraded with a Japanese mylar film capacitor,more range of tone control and a smoother response.
