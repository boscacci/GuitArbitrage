{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Mint 2016 Gibson Les paul 50's tribute HP. I bought as new old stock from guitar center online. I bought this with the intention to play gigs with it, but played it less than an half hour and didn't like the neck, to chunky for me, I guess I'm just spoiled from having a 1980 gibson les paul custom with a slim neck. It has a titanium adjustable nut, fast access heel, satin finish, the g force tuners which are completely junk were removed and replaced with grover locking tuners. I removed the removable pick guard (Looks so much better without it) it just pops off and on but it does have a big scratch on the guard, not from playing but from not having it on guitar and not in gig bag. The guitar itself does not have a mark on it, like I said I played it for under a half hour and I don't use a pick (fingers only) and then into the gig bag it went and has been put up in the closet ever since. It is basically a brand new guitar with no wear on it. Please ask questions before bidding I will do my best to answer everything you would like to know about the guitar. I only accept paypal for payment. I will not accept returns. I will only ship within the U.S. NO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING! Bid with confidence I have 100% feedback and have given an accurate description of item.", "ItemID": "292945167245", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T01:33:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-03T05:10:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-paul-2016-Ebony-satin-50s-tribute-HP-soft-shell-gig-bag-/292945167245", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Litchfield, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929451672458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/koIAAOSw0~pcVmxH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/WVUAAOSwkelcVmx7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/eHoAAOSw3ltcVmzF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/jl0AAOSwF7lcVm0V/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/3cIAAOSwIbtcVm1o/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/MEkAAOSwxs9cVm3G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/0wAAAOSwCYJcVm4r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/KUwAAOSwnjZcVm5r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "62056", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "csharp_311", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 74, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 734}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les paul (2016) Ebony satin 50's tribute HP & soft shell gig bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul 50s Tribute HP"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Ebony"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 43, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "2016 mint condition.
