GUILD SF-4 UP FOR AUCTION IS A GUILD STARFIRE 4 HOLLOW BODY ELECTRIC GUITAR. BASED ON THE SERIAL NUMBER, I BELIEVE IT WAS MADE IN 1983. THIS 36 YEAR OLD GUITAR REMAINS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. THE GLOSSY BLACK FINISH STILL HAS MOST OF ITS ORIGINAL LUSTER. IT HAS GOLD TONE HARDWARE. IT HAS A STRAIGHT NECK WITH LOW, SUPER PLAYABLE ACTION. ALL OF THE PICKUPS AND ELECTRONICS WORK PROPERLY AND THE GUITAR SOUNDS GREAT. THE ACTUAL CONDITION OF THE GUITAR IS AS FOLLOWS: THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME KIND OF PAINT OVERSPRAY ON THE TOP OF THE BODY AND THE FRONT OF THE HEADSTOCK IN THE FORM OF VERY TINY WHITE FLECKS. IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A BIT OF LIGHT DUST (VISIBLE IN PICS). THERE IS SOME BUCKLE RASH ON THE BACK OF THE BODY. THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO FRET WEAR AND THE FINGER BOARD IS EXCELLENT. THERE IS SOME CHIPPED PAINT NEXT TO THE BINDING AROUND THE CUTAWAYS AT THE TOP OF THE BODY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE NECK. YOU CAN SEE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE SMALL AREA WHERE THE PAINT AND FINISH HAS OVERLAPPED THE BINDING BY A FEW MILIMETERS (SHOWN IN DETAIL). THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF CHECKING STARTING TO DEVELOPE IN THAT AREA AND AROUND THE INPUT JACK. OTHER THAN THAT, THERE ARE JUST SOME TYPICAL HANDLING MARKS AND LIGHT SCRATCHES HERE AND THERE. IT WILL COME IN A NICE HARD SHELL CASE MADE BY GATOR CASES. I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE I AM BEATING THE GUITAR UP. IT IS A REALLY A NICE PIECE. IT'S A REAL PLAYER WITH A NICE STRAIGHT NECK, LOW ACTION AND BEAUTIFUL TONE. WE JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT ANY FLAWS IN THE SPIRIT OF FULL DISCLOSURE.
