{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1990's IBANEZ / Fujigen S570 SOL S-Series MIJ 3.08kg 22 fret Electric Guitar. Flat stealth black looks sweet. Original hardware edge tremelo with brass block tone improvement and tremel-no trem locker installed for easy string changing or fixed bridge operation. Guitar sustains well and notes are articulate. Custom S truss rod cover made of ebony wood with depth engraved 'S'. Joe Barden humbucker in neck and bridge, these are pre buy out when Joe Barden still made them, middle pickup is a Dimarzio fast track 2 which is a single coil designed to match output of humbucker. Pickups alone were almost $500.00. Bridge does solo and high gain very well, neck has a great tone, more for rhythm, slightly brighter, very high fi sounding pickups. Neck is fairly stright grained quartersawn maple which improves sustain. There is a toggle switch which was intended to split the neck pickup to single coil, but it is not wired. Guitar is fully functional otherwise. No fret buzz, frets in good condition. Plays well, action set up for soloing. Dunlop straplocks installed. Electronics cavity is fully shielded with real copper. Wizard neck plays amazing as always with these necks. Logo looks white but actually mirror chrome on the headstock (Ibanez and swoosh)There is some imperfections and a few small dings but only aesthetic and rather minor. This is a players guitar. Quality wise, i would say its on par with brand new ibanez guitars that are close to $2000.00.. like prestige and other Japanese made. Ships in prestige ibanez case. Shipped with UPS Ground, need zip code for shipping estimate. Will be shipped with insurance. SHIPPING IS UPS flat 100.00 Note: forgot to mention, i i stalled titanium string lock inserts in the Edge tremelo. This improves vibration transfer, soaks up less sustain than the factory ones.", "ItemID": "163531532194", "EndTime": "2019-02-18T03:01:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-08T03:01:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1990s-IBANEZ-Fujigen-S-series-Japan-S-Series-MIJ-3-08kg-Electric-Guitar-/163531532194", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nampa, Idaho", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635315321948080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J5oAAOSwT9hcXOoo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-RQAAOSwHodcXOor/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/btYAAOSwUBlcXOov/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J6wAAOSwj61cXOo1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/P3sAAOSwRW9cXOo4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mPQAAOSwElhcXOo7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/h14AAOSwuilcXOo9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R9IAAOSwjR5cXOpA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p6wAAOSwWnhcXOpD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PUoAAOSwGLZcXO8h/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xf4AAOSwz4xcXO8j/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f6YAAOSwTOZcXO~I/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "83687", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "oneogpelone", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1312, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 412.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 412.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***3", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 498}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1990's IBANEZ / Fujigen S series Japan S-Series MIJ 3.08kg Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez / Fujigen"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990's"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["S570"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Listing", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["SOL Oil Finish"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 1143, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 417.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
