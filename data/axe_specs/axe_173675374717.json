{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This listing is for a USA Peavey Nitro Limited w/orig hsc (#270 of 700). Its in good condition. everything works as it should. Neck is straight and truss rod works as it should. I happen to love ebony fretboard is excellent. Frets are good sized and in good condition. IT NEEDS A GOOD SET UP!. The Kahler Floyd Rose LIC. Double locking Tremolo System vibrato tail piece is beyond my very limited abilities to set up properly. The neck is VERY fast for me. There is a ding on the front of the guitar body. (See pics). The variety of pups/switches allow a wide variety of sounds. I played mostly blues/bottle neck (drove my stodgy playing partners crazy! lol). Its a high end guitar at a steal (as long as you get good with the '80s head stock! lol) It comes with the orig case, whammy bar a strap locks. I missed some dust in the pics...its been sitting in it case, unstrung these past 6-9mos. FWIW, Im only selling it because health issues have killed my ability to play any longer. Im selling off most of my gear including peddles, a vintage Supro amp, etc...thanks for stopping my...W6 \"...Dates of manufacture: 1987 to 1989Production of the Peavey Nitro Limited began in 1987 and ended in 1989. Only 700 were made in total. It was the top of the Nitro range with a neck-though body, black cherry finish, gold hardware, Schaller strap-locks and ebony fingerboard with abalone position markers. Peavey described the Nitro Limited as follows in 1988: \"The Nitro with the \u201cneck-thru\" body construction. This premium Nitro features gold hardware. and the body is finished in beautiful black cherry. The neck is the dream of American craftsmanship with its ebony fingerboard and figuring in polished abalone. The Nitro Limited produces excellent sustain and the overall performance is as good as its appearance..... truly a class instrument in the Nitro tradition.\"", "ItemID": "173675374717", "EndTime": "2018-12-05T09:24:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T02:00:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Nitro-Limited-270-700-/173675374717", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cheshire, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736753747178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM1MFg4NTI=/z/WiEAAOSwVBVb314Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/5OoAAOSwcs1b3149/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/BxgAAOSwhhlb315~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIxMlgxNjAw/z/vdAAAOSwHjtb316l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3MVgxMDI5/z/408AAOSw7R9b317~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1M1gxMDY1/z/S4UAAOSwUVhb319M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2MVgxMDE3/z/oxgAAOSw-GNb31-a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzM1gxMzM4/z/vK8AAOSw44db31~c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIxOFgxMDEz/z/AeYAAOSwi7Vb32AQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/epQAAOSwzHFb32BG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/aVAAAOSwenJb32Bi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwN1gxMDIw/z/YAsAAOSw3fxb32DM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "97419", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hallaction", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1395, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 345.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 345.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 309}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey Nitro Limited, #270 of 700", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Nitro Limited"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Floyd Rose Trem"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1987-1989"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 24, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "has some nicks and dings, overall in very good condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
