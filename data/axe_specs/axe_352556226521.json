{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a 2007 Used Fender American Deluxe Telecaster. As you can see by the available pictures this guitar has been modified (with several improvements). These are the base model specs: - Solid Alder Body- Modern \"C\" shape maple neck- Samarian Cobalt Noiseless pickups (bridge and neck)- Chrome plated Solid brass bridge plate- Chrome plated, solid brass saddles- Maple Fingerbord- Bi-flex Truss rod- 22 Medium Jumbo Frets These are the modifications made to this instrument:- Original pick-up guard has been replaced by an off-white aged 3 ply pick-guard- The original samarian noiseless pickups have been replaced with Lindy Fralin Stock telecaster pickups (hand-wound)- The original bridge plate has been replaced with a vintage style 3 saddle chrome bridge plate- The original 3 way selector switch has been replaced with a 4 way oak grisbey selector switch This instrument is in overall excellent condition. It does have some very minimal wear and tear. Included is the original black case and case candy. It was originally purchased by myself in 2013 and has had one previous owner. As noted there have been multiple modifications to this instrument which in my opinion significantly improves the tone and look of the guitar. The Lindy Fralin stock telecaster pickups were an additional $150 dollar modification that really provides the sound of a vintage telecaster which to my ears is preferable to the base model noiseless pickups. In addition the vintage style 3 saddle chrome bridge plate also provides a more natural sound than the stock model bridge plate. If you haven't had an experience with the 4 way selector switch, this is a very interesting modification for a telecaster that allows the normal parellel play of the bridge and neck pickups that would be usually expected with a telecaster, but there is also a switch that allows the bridge and neck pickups to play in series which provides the same sound as a humbucker as well. That being said, I have included the original pick-guard, original bridge plate with saddles, and original noiseless pickups that are already prewired to the base 3 selector switch. Please feel free to ask any questions regarding this instrument. This is an excellent playing and sounding guitar especially with the modifications.
