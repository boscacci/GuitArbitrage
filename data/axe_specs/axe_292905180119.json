{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Raise my rent, cut my pay, another axe goes away. 80's vintage. Solid construction--wood feels dense. There's some scuffs, including where a previous owner puttied some: see pics. Neck pocket has been sanded a bit aggressively--currently shimmed around pocket with ye olde duct tape. Control knobs are mix-matched, I think some are Fenders. EVH eye screws for strap buttons. Shielding. Tremolo cover is some Chinese crap. Neck passes ruler check. Jack is a bit noisy. I can't vouch for the wiring on the five way: it works, I just am not sure which pots should be available in which setting. Bridge is a bit grimy, does not appear to be corrosion to me. Off white color is aged to ivory, including a one or two sticker shadows. Peavey is a friendly, customer-service oriented company, which is so cool. They had parts when I called a few years ago, and would be happy to help. This was my first an main electric for a long time. Cut an enter album with it--a single coil that chugs pretty good. I'd prefer to keep it to A/B singles and hums, and just for nostalgia. Just don't have the space mostly, and could use the cash for other things. Shipping cost varies by location. As is. Thanks for lookin', happy eBaying, and Rock on!", "ItemID": "292905180119", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T20:01:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T22:22:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Predator-Vintage-80s-Electric-Guitar-Off-White-/292905180119", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Tualatin, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929051801198080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yCkAAOSwHPdcMS5N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MFgAAOSwUWtcMS5a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/H6cAAOSwzd9cMSKP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FogAAOSwd7FcMSMT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FeAAAOSwd7FcMSKo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Yv4AAOSwTDpcMSKt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ru0AAOSwIS9cMSK1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/M7YAAOSw~llcMSK9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WhwAAOSw~xtcMSLC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k5gAAOSw8R9cMSLM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v~EAAOSwPmVcMSL8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ro4AAOSwpRxcMSMg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "97062", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thickanthin", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 161, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 124.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 124.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 197}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey Predator Vintage '80s Electric Guitar Off White", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Off White"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Predator"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 137, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Light relic/some mods", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
