{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I recently bought this as a project. It had been 'splashed' with some sort of purple paint, which looked sort of cool at first, but the more I looked at it, the uglier it got. I scraped it and buffed most of it off, but there is probably a hint of purple here and there on the body. I'm blind as a bat and I'm sure I missed something. I wasn't 100% positive when I got it, as the date stamps in the neck pocket had been sanded and were illegible, so I checked the factory stamp in the pickup cavity with Fender's customer service guys and they verified that it is indeed a 2018 Fender Polar White Players Series Stratocaster, made in Mexico on 4/19/2018. The pickguard and pickups were purchased separately and originally came off a 2001 Fender USA Custom shop Strat, but I don't know if they were original to that guitar. I don't know the exact models of the pickups either, and am not very familiar with Lace Sensors in general. I added some copper shielding tape as the conductive paint did not connect along the entire pickup cavity (see pics). The pickguard holes were not an exact match to the body but are close enough to not be noticeable. I was going to fill and redrill them for the new guard, since there were already a few additional holes drilled from an earlier pickguard install prior to my purchase. I never got around to it and it's not a real big deal anyway as everything is covered by the pickguard. Includes a pair of Fender strap locks. The tremolo is of unknown origin. I don't believe it is a Fender, but it's complete and appears to work properly. Bar is included.
