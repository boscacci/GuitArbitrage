{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction/sale is a 2017 Gibson ES-339 Electric Guitar with Epiphone hardshell case! The guitar is gloss Ginger Burst and in excellent condition. The guitar was upgraded with Seymour Duncan P-Rails pickups. These pickups give you the ability to use the pickups as humbuckers and/or single coils with push-pull pots. The pickups and electronics were installed and set-up completed by the 920D custom shop. The original pickups (Gibson '57 Classic Humbuckers) and electronics are included with this auction. Grover Rotomatic tuners were standard on this model, so this guitar stays in tune! The guitar plays and sounds great! The auction also includes an Epiphone hardshell case (logo appears to have been spray-painted black) that is in very good condition. I believe the guitar originally came in a gig bag. Photos are of the actual guitar and case. Auction is for guitar and case only. Guitar is being sold outside of eBay; therefore, I reserve the right to end the auction early. Guitar is being sold as-is and returns are not accepted. Payment is due within 3 business days or I reserve the right to re-list the guitar. Guitar will be de-tuned prior to shipping. I will only ship to the CONTINENTAL US. Shipping will be flat $75 for insured, standard ground. If you need expedited shipping, please contact me before paying for the guitar. Local buyer can make arrangements to pick up the guitar to save on shipping costs, to do so, please contact me before paying for the guitar. Please only bid if you intend to pay for the item. Please contact me if you have questions.
