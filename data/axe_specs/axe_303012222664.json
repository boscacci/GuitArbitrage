This new 2009 Limited Run Series guitar from Gibson USA combines the classic appointments of the iconic Les Paul with a few of Gibson\u2019s most functional attributes. First and foremost, the standard Les Paul cutaway gives way to the wider Florentine Cutaway. Normally found on such historic Gibson models as the Byrdland, the ES-175 and the ES-295, the Florentine Cutaway design comfortably enhances a player\u2019s reach to the higher register of notes. Second, and most prominent, is the addition of the chrome Bigsby vibrato tailpiece, which allows players the ability to bend the pitch of notes or entire chords for vintage-style vibrato. A white graphite nut, locking Grover tuners and Schaller roller bridge all work in conjunction to keep the guitar in tune and offer better string control when using the Bigsby. Of course, the body is traditional Les Paul \u2013 solid mahogany back topped by a AA-grade maple top with single-ply antique cr\u00e8me binding, smoothed with Gibson\u2019s classic Vintage Sunburst finish. The neck is the standard Les Paul mahogany neck with Gibson\u2019s new asymmetrical profile and rosewood fingerboard. A pair of Gibson\u2019s renowned BurstBucker Pro\u2122 pickups offer slightly higher output and allow amps to achieve a more natural break-up. They are packed with asymmetrical coils \u2014 true to Gibson\u2019s original PAFs \u2014 which supply a more open sound. The BurstBucker Pro\u2122 Neck is wound slightly less than the original PAFs, while the BurstBucker Pro\u2122 Bridge is slightly overwound for increased output. Like all the guitars from this special series, only 350 of these unique Les Pauls will be produced and distributed. Each one will come with a black Gibson hardshell case and special Limited Run Series certificate of authenticity.", "ItemID": "303012222664", "EndTime": "2019-01-05T18:48:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-29T18:48:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-2009-custom-shop-LES-PAUL-FLORENTINE-limited-edition-only-350-made-/303012222664", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Galloway, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030122226648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4mUAAOSw-V1cJ7yt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZZMAAOSwxDJcJ7yK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8voAAOSwJ~xcJ7yN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dTcAAOSwcqxcJ7z1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uvYAAOSwBkNcJ7z-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/A~EAAOSwtaBcJ70E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i1YAAOSwdwVcJ70R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9ewAAOSwVAtcJ70Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-zQAAOSwe7ZcKOrO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9ncAAOSwOHpcKOrS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/unIAAOSwdwVcKOrV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "43119", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "brazenh43", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 155, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 88.9}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1481.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1481.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 792}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson 2009 custom shop  LES PAUL FLORENTINE limited edition only 350 made ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Items Included", "Value": ["Case"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2009"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Normal type electric guitar"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Solid Mahogany Body"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["LES PAUL SUPREME FLORENTINE"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul custom shop"]}]}, "HitCount": 438, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1506.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar is in Excellent Condition, except for a few very small nicks barely noticeable.The guitar is complete with a Bigsby tailpiece with a tailpiece extension to make restringing very easy.It is solid mahogany, no hollow places in the body.This guitar has locking tuners", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
