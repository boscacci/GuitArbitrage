{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Lack of space forces the reluctant sale of this beautiful German made vintage Hofner 161 Colorama 1961 electric guitar which is in full working order and 100% original and complete to the best of my knowledge. The guitar is in very good overall condition for its age, but please look at the photos carefully as they are a part of the description. The guitar body is the beautiful original Red Cellulose finish with dual gold racing stripes around the edges. On the headstock is the Hofner logo, truss rod cover and original nut - along with six original inline tuners with rugby ball buttons. A set of Vintage Schaller tuners (M6 180) was fitted to the guitar well over 30 years ago but I've changed them back to the original tuners that came with the guitar - hence why there are other screw holes on the back of the headstock. The Schaller tuners will be included in the sale if you wish to use these rather than the originals. The guitar neck is dead straight, very smooth and feels really comfortable and easy to play due to the superb neck profile. The rosewood fretboard with inlaid pearl dot markers make it lovely to look at and a pleasure to play. Around the edges of the guitar, there are signs of wear and tear where the paint and lacquer have begun to wear off in places - more so at the bottom of the neck - at the heel where it is more extreme. However, the overall body finish looks good considering the age of the guitar and the amount of time it has been played. There are no major scratches or bumps or anything else that would have an adverse effect on playability or sound, but please look at the images carefully and make your own mind up. The pickguard is original and has a small crack near the pickup control unit which was present when I purchased the guitar - it can be replaced quite easily though if you so wish as there are numerous websites that provide replacements at a reasonable cost.The original control panel works as it should and the original diamond type 510 single pickup and electronics all work correctly. I'm unable to find any serial numbers anywhere on the guitar, however, the POT code on the brown electronic plate is 250k 481 (250K Ohms, 48th week of 1961) if you're interested. The open trapeze tailpiece which holds the strings in place is original too - along with the adjustable bridge, which over time has marked the wood slightly underneath, but isn't too bad. The hard case is included in the sale and is extremely robust and protects the guitar very well. I don\u2019t think it's a genuine Hofner or Selmer case although it came with the guitar when I bought it almost 30 years ago and the previous owner said it came with the guitar when it was passed down to him as well. Please note that the latches on the case are rusty and will both need replacing if you intend to use the case regularly as one of the latches is broken and will fall off. I've described the guitar to the best of my ability and have included photos that give a good overall representation of how the guitar looks including any distinguishing marks or bumps etc. The guitar is sold 'as is' so please study the photos carefully as they form part of the description. I do not provide a returns service, so If you're not happy or have any doubts whatsoever - please do not bid.Please feel free to ask any questions and I will answer them as best as I can.
