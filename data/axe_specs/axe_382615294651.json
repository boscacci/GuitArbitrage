{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I believe this is a Squier, Made in Korea body but not 100% positive. I bought this guitar at a garage sale several years ago. The guy said it's a Squier (for whatever reason he sanded off all the info on the headstock - Maybe he was going to put on an American sticker - I don't know). The neck butt was stamped Apr 97 and the back read Crafted In Korea with the S/N 7045324 so I believe this is a Squier body from 97. It played fine but I really prefer single coil Strats and didn't play it much so I already sold the neck and am selling the body separately so people don't have to deal with high shipping costs and separately they are much easier to pack. I believe this was black looking at the neck cavity. The guy worked at a wood shop and it was sanded down to refinish / paint. The wood was awesome so they just put clear over it. Really no dings or dents to the body. Very nice shape. A few little scuffs on the back plastic piece. I'm fairly certain this is ash and not alder. It has upgraded Mighty Mite Mutherbucker pick-ups. If you want to see the neck, go to advanced search and query completeds for Fender Squier Korean Neck. This is a hardtail, not routed for a tremolo. I would imagine you may have to make some saddle adjustments when you bolt on the neck. I will include the back plate and 4 screws for that. I'm not certain why there are 5 holes and a center hole at the neck cavity, but it just uses the 4 screws. I will add what I wrote for the condition description in the item description here as well: I bought this guitar at a garage sale several years ago. The guy said it's a Squier (for whatever reason he sanded off all the info on the neck headstock). The neck butt was stamped Apr 97 and the back read Crafted In Korea with the S/N 7045324 so I believe this is a Squier body from 97. Body was sanded down and the wood was what looks to be a beautiful ash so they did a clear coat. Looks like maybe a tiny drop of filler on the front - I can't really tell (see last picture). The clear coat looks good, but portions of the back aren't perfectly smooth. You really don't notice unless you scrutinize. Upgraded Mighty Mite Mutherbuckers, tone and volume pots and switch all work fine. Body only - No neck.
