This Strat is in fantastic condition. All stock except the white pickup covers and knobs were replaced aged white versions. Everything else is as it came from the dealer. Original alnico 5 staggered pickups, which sound really nice.The finish is excellent, with a nice aging white tone starting to develop. Neck is pristine and plays very well. There are tiny swirl marks here and there on the very top most of the finish from normal playing. The only thing worth mentioning is a very very small paint chip on the lower side under the tone knob, I included a picture of this.Included is the original case in excellent condition. Case candy is included, everything pictured is included with the guitar.
