{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I bought this guitar with the idea that I'd play it a lot and become really good but the truth is I played it a few times and just moved on to other things instead. So this beauty has been very gently and lightly used, it is almost as good as brand new. No dings, scratches or damage of any kind. Included with the sale is the guitar stand and strap I bought for it. Description: The Les Paul-100 from Epiphone incorporates all the major features of a Les Paul, but in a more affordable boltneck version. The carved-top Mahogany body has a Mahogany neck with Rosewood fingerboard and the body is actually a little thinner than LP Studio's or Standards for a lighter, comfortable feel. You will get great classic LP tone from a set of hot 700T and 650R open-coil Humbucker pickups, each with separate tone and volume controls. Plus, standard equipment on all of our electric guitar line, it comes with 500K Ohms potentiometers, our own heavy-duty 3-way pickup selector toggle switch and non-rotating heavy duty output jack. This guitar also features Chrome hardware including the Epiphone LockTone locking Tune-o-matic bridge and Stop-bar tailpiece for increased sustain to to give you an even better value.
