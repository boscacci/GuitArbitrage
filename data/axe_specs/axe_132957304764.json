{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson ES 175 2007 W / OHSC Gorgeous!!. Condition is Used. These guitars are probably best known as the universal standard for jazz guitarists, but they make great rock-a-billy guitars. So, I had a Bigsby installed. Don\u2019t freak out! No holes were drilled in the top because this model Bigsby doesn\u2019t require that. In fact, even the two holes for the hinge piece where it folds around the side would be completely hidden were I to reinstall the original trapeze, which I\u2019m more than happy to do. But, if you\u2019ve never played one set up with a Bigsby, you outta give it a try. It\u2019s a thing of beauty, even for jazz. Anyway, to each their own. I also had my luthier make and install a nice bone nut for it. That corrected a string spacing issue it had when I got it. The 1st string was closer than it should\u2019ve been to the edge of the fretboard making it feel a little awkward. Besides, the original one wasn\u2019t real bone. The neck is nice and straight with smooth action up and down and no buzzing frets. The frets were professionally dressed and there\u2019s plenty of life left in them. I\u2019m not the original owner, but the electronics are fine and there is no indication they were ever changed - someone asked me about that. I have it set up with D\u2019Addario 10s because I wanted to use it for some rockabilly in my band, but my band mates voted the idea down. Much as I love rockabilly I don\u2019t need this caliber of guitar just to play it at home. A Strat just doesn\u2019t cut it live. I will include the original tail piece, or have it installed if you like, as long as I get to keep the Bigsby. Otherwise it comes Bigsby equipped with the original tailpiece in the case. Aside from being a pretty thing, it plays and sounds great! I\u2019ll pack it in the original case, then in a suitable box, then ship it to the buyer. Only shipping to CONUS. I\u2019ll cover the cab fare and insurance.", "ItemID": "132957304764", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T22:54:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T05:21:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-ES-175-2007-W-OHSC-Gorgeous-/132957304764", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Memphis, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329573047648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/43AAAOSwlR9cajdC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iz0AAOSwaRRcajc8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gG0AAOSwyXtcajc-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/euEAAOSw6DNcajdP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ppgAAOSwZGJcajdS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/97wAAOSws7FcajdF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjc2/z/za4AAOSwTJZcajc3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ2OFgxNjAw/z/KMUAAOSwfQBcajc1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/W2kAAOSwroJcasu3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f8IAAOSw18Bcasu6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j8cAAOSw0q1casu~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/njkAAOSwUElcasu1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "38134", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "crazyboutguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 586, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson ES 175 2007 W / OHSC Gorgeous!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-175"]}]}, "HitCount": 161, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
