{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Selling a 1972 Fender Telecaster Thinline Guitar (Not a reissue). This model originally had a Bigsby tremolo but that was replaced with a wrap around style bridge. Screw holes for the bigsby are covered by the stickers. Guitar was also re-routed for single coil Pickups. An aftermarket pickguard was created for the single coils and wiring. Volume knobs are not working right now. Only two of the Pickups are wired and working. Red knobs click the Pickups on and off. There is also a kill switch for everything right in the middle. Will need a little wiring work to get it all back to functional if you chose. Neck is straight. Truss rod works. Guitar has been re-fretted at some point. Frets have plenty of life left in them. Guitar body was also refinished at some point. Looks weirdly stained in certain spots, as you can see. I tried to capture the whole guitar with photos. This is just a cool looking vintage guitar that has been uniquely personalized. No cracks or breaks. Guitar is solid. US Shipping Only, lower 48. No case but will be packed well for Shipping. Will require a signature due to the value. Will be insured. Selling as is, no refunds.", "ItemID": "264208393241", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T01:42:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-22T01:42:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1972-Fender-Telecaster-Thinline-Vintage-Guitar-/264208393241", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Gilbert, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2642083932418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iNcAAOSwprtcR608/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gaQAAOSwJp1cR606/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Vm4AAOSwohVcR61E/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-GoAAOSwRWZcR61H/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7cQAAOSwZ-9cR61J/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QFAAAOSwJQVcR605/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GTgAAOSwdxFcR61B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EDAAAOSwjMtcR60-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDEwODc=/z/13gAAOSwVCpcR603/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDk3Mg==/z/5BUAAOSwl1RcR60~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzMzWDEwNDY=/z/YUcAAOSw2qpcR61C/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDEwNzk=/z/v3QAAOSw~2VcR61F/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "85296", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tellurideskiing", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 446, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1157.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1157.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1721}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1972 Fender Telecaster Thinline Vintage Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1972"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Thinline"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 603, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1182.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
