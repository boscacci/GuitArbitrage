{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a one-owner Fender Artist Series Eric Johnson Signature Stratocaster in stunning white blonde with maple neck and fretboard. Deep contoured '57 style two-piece lightweight alder body dressed in a very thin nitrocellulose lacquer finish. 1-piece quarter sawn maple neck with 12\" fretboard radius and vintage tint. Staggered vintage style tuners eliminate the need for a string tree. Custom Shop Eric Johnson pickups with 5-way switching. Vintage tremolo with silver painted block and '57 style string recess. 1-ply parchment pickguard. Volume, neck-tone and bridge-tone controls. Nickel/chrome hardware. Deluxe blond hardshell case with black ends. Includes all original case candy, hang tags, tremolo arm, vintage-style leather strap, etc. This guitar has been played very little and there is virtually no visible fret wear. This guitar has stayed in my climate controlled smoke-free recording studio its entire life. The guitar was made in December, 2011. I bought the guitar brand new in August of 2016. There is one tiny blemish about 1/8\" in diameter on the top edge of the top horn (see second last photo). In person, it's barely noticeable and you have to look very carefully to see it. Other than that, the guitar is in flawless condition. There is a small (about 3/4\" long) ding in the tolex covering on the case which is visible in the last photo. US buyers only please. Shipping within continental USA only. Local pickup in Grapevine Texas can be arranged. Payment must be received within 48 hours of auction end.", "ItemID": "303021456068", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T18:42:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T03:43:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2011-Fender-Eric-Johnson-Stratocaster-Maple-Fretboard-White-Blonde-Near-Mint-/303021456068", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Grapevine, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030214560688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oH8AAOSwuPZbvTG9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yIEAAOSwNjxbvTHX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/evgAAOSw43JbvTHZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HCoAAOSwXpFbvTHY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/75sAAOSwnVRbvTHY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dQ0AAOSwYsBbvTHY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jPcAAOSwTGVbvTHX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XyAAAOSwUlRbvTHU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CacAAOSwpTJbvTHY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y78AAOSwBRVbvTHW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/atkAAOSwMxJbvTpk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-xQAAOSwJtVbvTHq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "76051", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "andrew_ahmad", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 37, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 651}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2011 Fender Eric Johnson Stratocaster Maple Fretboard White Blonde - Near Mint", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Artist Series"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Eric Johnson"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White Blonde"]}]}, "HitCount": 76, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
