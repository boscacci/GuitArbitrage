{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar has been awesome, but I need to upgrade to a 7 string since most of my favorite bands have as well. It has the $290 Joe Barden (JBE) Modern T-Style pickups made famous by Danny Gatton. These pickups are awesome and in my opinion make this guitar one of the best sounding Tele style guitars you can buy. Check out some videos and see for yourself. However to satisfy anyone who prefers the original equipment Alnico V single coil pickups that came stock with the guitar, I will include those as well. They will ship with the guitar in the JBE pickup box. I have installed a brand new set of strings and will also include the last set of unopened strings that came in the pack. The vintage style tuners are great. You cut the string to length (about 2 inches past the tuner and then shove the end of the string inside the shaft of the tuner. Then you fold it through the groves in the side and start wrapping. No more sharp string tips to cut yourself on or snag on things. The nut has been upgraded from the original plastic nut to a ball bearing roller nut. This thing has been awesome. There are only two minor blemishes on the guitar. One by the nut and one one the edge of the body by the strap peg (see pics). Other than that there are the normal wear patterns for a 3 year old guitar. There is some swirling on the gloss finish of the black pickguard, but no scratches on the guitar anywhere other than the two spots mentioned. I do not have a case for the guitar (it has never left my house in fact) so i will ship the guitar inside of two other guitar boxes. One will be nested inside of the other. The original pickups and the extra set of strings will be inside the inner box with the guitar. UPS Ground shipping will be included in the sales price.", "ItemID": "183700493897", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T09:51:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-23T22:06:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-Classic-Vibe-Telecaster-50s-Joe-Barden-JBE-Modern-pickups-/183700493897", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Olive Branch, Mississippi", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1837004938978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ys4AAOSw6PtccblP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bV4AAOSw9Clccbl2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gKoAAOSwlTZccblX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EbIAAOSwHVdccbl6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OlYAAOSwya1ccblg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/s70AAOSw6xVccblj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uIkAAOSw2RJccbmA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OEMAAOSwTOZccblS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OPgAAOSwey5ccb76/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sR0AAOSwx2Bccblc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nPcAAOSwZntccbyW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nbMAAOSw0dFccblm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "38654", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "scott0771", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 104, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 431}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squier Classic Vibe Telecaster '50s with Joe Barden (JBE) Modern pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Pine Body Maple Neck"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender Squier"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Classic Vibe Telecaster &#39;50s"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Butterscotch Blonde"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Brand New Strings", "Vintage Style Tuners", "JBE Danny Gatton Modern T-Style pickups"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["21 Fret"]}]}, "HitCount": 225, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
