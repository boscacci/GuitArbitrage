{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Squire Bullet Hard Tail made in Japan 1983-84 with Padded Gig Bag. Condition is Used. Who ever had this guitar before me took very good care of it as I also do.This is in great condition - Body looks good just a few scuffs, dings from use but nothing the camera could capture. The neck is also great, Straight no buzz, frets look real good. Picture10 shows a little dimple or indention hole in the fingerboard that I have no idea what that is but it doesn't affect bending strings or the playability of the neck at all. There is a small drill hole in the pick guard just above the volume knob and between the bridge and middle pick up - picture 3 - and I have no idea what that is there for ether. Electronics work as they should and the guitar plays and sounds great. Set up real nice with a new set of strings. This will be packed very well. I ship USPS Priority insured, Buyer pays $58.37 shipping.", "ItemID": "132963203327", "EndTime": "2019-03-02T01:26:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-23T01:26:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squire-Bullet-Hard-Tail-Made-Japan-1983-84-Padded-Gig-Bag-/132963203327", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Carriere, Mississippi", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329632033278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ISQAAOSwzE5ccJ0A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VkcAAOSwCV5ccJ0L/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qQMAAOSwd9dccJ0W/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BmUAAOSwP79ccJ0h/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FT0AAOSwcntccJ0r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NLYAAOSwcwdccJy8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vaEAAOSwWkFccJ04/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KZ0AAOSwGFZccJ1V/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4RIAAOSwn2pccJ1k/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4zcAAOSwKxVccJ1y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IpIAAOSwIxVccJ2H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/flwAAOSwYkRccJ23/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "39426", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "buffilo-bobstring", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 55, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 224.72, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 224.72, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 6}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squire Bullet Hard Tail - Made In Japan 1983-84 with Padded Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Bullet"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 246, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 227.22, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
