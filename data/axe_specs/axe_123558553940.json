Here are the cool things about this guitar -  Mahogany body! Roller nut (my favorite part), mother of pearl dots, locking tuners, Fender Deluxe bridge (this is my second favorite thing. It feels much better against your hand than standard Strat bridges. There are no set screws that stick up - way better. It also has a snap-in aluminum tremolo handle which is also better than the norm (not the screw in with a plastic cap). There are no dents or chips or anything - just some pick scuffs on the pickguard, but you really have to examine it in the light to see them.It has a micro-adjust neck and the rounded corner on the neck plate for easier playing high up on the neck. Also, a 22-fret neck of course. All American made.No other Stratocaster can go from Lynyrd Skynyrd to AC/DC like this one. The mahogany body and Diamondback Humbucker has seriously heavy low end. Comes with all the paperwork.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
