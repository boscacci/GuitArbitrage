{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2013 Epiphone SG Custom with Maestro trem from the Limited Edition TV Pelham Blue series. Epiphone ProBucker pickups with push-pull coil splits. It's been played less than 20 hours, and has been sitting in my smoke free studio since I purchased it new. The only modification was a removable strip of felt below the Maestro spring to protect the finish and keep the movement quiet for recording. This thing is in basically new shape, and you will be hard-pressed to find another for sale. The only sign of age on this guitar is that poly clear coat shows some signs of yellowing, as many poly-coated guitars and other TV Pelham guitars from this series do. It's only visible from certain angles and in certain light, and is mainly on the neck/horns. I've tried my best to highlight this in several of the photos, but it is pretty subtle. If you like 50s Gibson style fat necks, you'll love this guitar. I will also include a RoadRunner padded bag.
