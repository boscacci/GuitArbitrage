{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for grabs! A beautiful 1993 Japanese-made Jackson King V Std Professional Series in White Finish. This guitar is simply not found these days among the dozens, if not hundreds of cheaper-built King V's. This model which is an extremely great player is so slick looking and in really great condition. There are a few things to mention and which can also be easily seen in the pictures. The screw on the bridge that is used to attach the trem arm is chipped. It has no effect on performance. The horns have some wear on them and a bit of buckle rash on back. Comes with the Original Hardshell Case which is in really good condition with a small crack in the bottom. Doesn't really show much and doesn't effect the case at all. Comes with original tremolo bar (which is in perfect condition).\u00a0 already installed as well as the original guitar strap buttons too. As for other normal wear, this guitar has some typical places on it that indicate that it is indeed used, but none of them detract away from the beauty of the instrument. Please see detailed photos that show the normal wear for a guitar that's 20+ years old. 850 listing price. Thanks Just some neat trivia about this instrument- It was built in the Japanese factory for Jackson and the quality was known to rival that of the USA-built instruments at that time (the PRO instruments) and so because of this, Jackson discontinued having this series built in Japan.
