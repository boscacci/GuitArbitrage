NO RETURNS DESCRIPTION BELOWLes Paul Studio Raw PowerGibson USA\u2019s Les Paul Studio Raw Power is a total natural \u2014 the Les Paul in its most basic form, yet built like none other before it. While the original Les Paul Standard\u2019s maple top has always set it apart from more common all-mahogany electrics, the Les Paul Studio Raw Power goes all out for maple\u2019s tonal splendors: an all-maple body matches the traditional maple top, for a brighter, more articulate tone, and a maple neck and fingerboard give each note a tight, snappy response. A pair of Gibson\u2019s renowned \u201957 Classic pickups, as featured on several high-end Custom Shop models, provides all the clear punch and muscle of those legendary \u201cPAFs.\u201d All the rest of the basics follow the classic specs you have come to expect from a Les Paul: 22-frets, a volume and control knob for each pickup, one three-way toggle switch, Grover vintage style green key tuners, and Gibson\u2019s pioneering Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece. The Les Paul Studio Raw Power from Gibson USA is solid.

ProcessThe Les Paul Studio Raw Power is hand-finished in nitrocellulose in a process that is carefully monitored to ensure minimum build-up, in an effort to produce a final finish that breathes with the guitar and enhances natural resonance. Unlike many other manufacturers, who settle for a polyurethane finish, Gibson opts for a nitrocellulose finish that will encourage the natural vibration of the instrument for a purer tone. In addition, a nitro finish is very porous and actually gets thinner over time. That way your guitar\u2019s wood can age beautifully and naturally.", "ItemID": "132851886793", "EndTime": "2018-11-14T05:27:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T05:27:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Raw-Power-Satin-White-cream-colored-2009-USED-/132851886793", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Folsom, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328518867938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTk3WDQ3OA==/z/Zk8AAOSwE9Bb5jJ-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMxWDQyMw==/z/xxYAAOSwW4db5jKC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTI1WDM5NA==/z/zKMAAOSwlx9b5jKG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTU1WDQxNQ==/z/UHMAAOSwVcZb5jKN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQxWDc2OQ==/z/RrYAAOSwUWtb5jKU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzQyWDY0Mw==/z/3asAAOSwUxlb5jKc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDA0WDU3Ng==/z/pXAAAOSwJTNb5jKh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDA2WDYwMg==/z/ZuoAAOSw8L5b5jKm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzA0WDc4NQ==/z/HO0AAOSwEGpb5jKs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDA5WDU4OQ==/z/WGkAAOSwV3hb5m-w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "95763", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "orionracer1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 158, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 614.96, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 614.96, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "8***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Studio Raw Power - Satin White (cream colored)\u00a0 2009 - USED", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2009"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 233, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 624.96, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
