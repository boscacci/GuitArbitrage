{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Kramer Focus 3000 Vintage 1980\u2019s with Floyd Rose. Condition is Used. Headstock has been damaged and repaired. The repair is visible and has held up. Got knocked over and fell. Effects the guitar not at all. This guitar is really great playing has a fast neck. These Japan Kramer\u2019s were really made well. Pictures show all the dings and dents and chips in the paint. It\u2019s from the 80\u2019s. This guitar has partied at many gigs and has a few bruises but still in really good shape considering how old it is. As far as I can tell everything operates as it should. Would love to sell the Marshall with the guitar because they sound so good together. But that price might scare everyone away. Ask all the questions you want and I will do my best to answer.
