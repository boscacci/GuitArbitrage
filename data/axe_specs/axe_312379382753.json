{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "PLEASE, Read the ENTIRE auction! Good Condition - Stamped factory second - played very little, I know there are some slight player blemishes, nothing major, but take that into account. The gold chrome is worn very noticeably, which is common on used guitars with gold chrome. Sounds and plays good. Play as is or set up to taste. Hate to let it go but I'm getting married. It has the 3 volume 1 tone thing going on that are scratchy and contrary sometimes, and need cleaning, 3 way switch, trem arm is attached and works but is missing a nut and washer I believe. It is a 9 out of 10 and the Epiphone Firebird case is a 9 of 10. GREAT Guitar. OOP and hard to come by. Returns only for gross misrepresentations.
