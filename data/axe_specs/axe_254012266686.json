{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Greco Device JJ1 aged white Guitar from the 1980s for sale, not sure what year, Made in Japan. This guitar is set up with medium strings, neck shimmed for better tremolo ability, everything works fine, in decent shape but has some dings, one on front has been filled with nail polish as well as some under the floyd, also has other small nicks and dings around the guitar, drilled hole on the back, see pics for details, missing tremolo back plate. The body is solid wood of some kind, probably alder or maybe mahogany, sounds great and is light weight. The neck is in nice shape, has minor fretwear but is straight and plays great, neck has smooth bare finish. Has \"wing\" floyd rose speedloader type copy with strings easily going through the saddle, as far as Floyd copies go this one is great, it's made of all steel and works great, edges are sharp. I was going to put the floyd on another guitar but the saddles were too long, hitting the body, so I tapped the saddle thread farther and was going to grind them shorter, but decided not to, so that's why they look gold, but they work fine. Pickups are Guitar Madness Invader style, sound great. Has individual pickup toggles, with this you can have bridge and neck, or all 3 pickups at once, or use as a kill switch, so has variety of uses more than a regular 5 way, 1 volume and 1 tone for all pickups. Also has schaller strap lock buttons. If you have any more questions let me know, thanks for looking", "ItemID": "254012266686", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T16:56:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-04T21:40:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980s-Greco-Device-JJ1-White-Super-Strat-soloist-style-Electric-guitar-Japan-/254012266686", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Athens, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540122666868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3JQAAOSwNFVcBvP6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/v0oAAOSwXwFcBvQC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GegAAOSwLuBcBvO~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/shMAAOSwcapcBvQf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PQ4AAOSwIUVcBvPE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zoIAAOSwXgxcBvQv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xn4AAOSwZddcBvPK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eHQAAOSwVXdcBvPN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OM8AAOSwWIJcBvQ8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PwUAAOSwE~1cBvPS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjE4/z/CrsAAOSwj-RcBvPV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/C8oAAOSw5wJcBvPX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "30608", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "beyondtherainbowdesigns", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1013, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 53}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980s Greco Device JJ1 White Super Strat soloist style Electric guitar, Japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Greco"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JJ1"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 712, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
