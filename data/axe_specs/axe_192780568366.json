{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Product Information Designed to inspire and with more than three decades of experience, the Charvel\u00ae Pro-Mod So-Cal Style 1 HH FR M is a slick performer with premium features and versatile sound every guitarist will appreciate. Born from a love of high-speed playing and smooth style, this fun-in-the-sun guitar is packed with the classic playability and innovative design elements that have made Charvel a legendary name in high-performance axes. More comfortable than an overstuffed armchair, the So-Cal body is sleekly sculpted out of alder and coupled with a rock-solid bolt-on two-piece maple neck with a pair of graphite reinforcement rods to handle the ravages of the road and climate. A conveniently located heel-mount spoke wheel allows for rapid truss rod tweaks, even in between songs. Engineered for effortlessly nimble playing, the speed neck profile and 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius maple fingerboard are perfect for all styles of play \u2013 from low end riffing to soaring leads with worry-free upper-register bends. Hot-rodded for unparalleled performance and sound, this instrument hosts a high-output Seymour Duncan\u00ae TB-6 Distortion humbucking bridge pickup and a warm, fat Seymour Duncan SH-6N Distortion humbucking neck pickup. The volume control hides a push/pull coil split for even more highly useful tonal variations, ideal for everything from a biting lead sound to thick, chunky rhythm work. The no-load tone control operates like a standard tone control from positions one through nine, removing itself from the circuit at position ten for transparent sound, letting the full natural voice of the guitar shine through. The Floyd Rose\u00ae 1000 Series double-locking tremolo bridge system allows players to scream and rumble without sacrificing tuning stability. Selling this charvel simply because I don't have a need for it anymore. This guitar is beautiful and in very good condition. Plays great, low action, 9-42 gauge strings, floyd rose, locking tuners and a beautiful finish called \"sea foam green\". Stays in tune wonderfully through any divebombs. The bridge pickup is a Seymour Duncan JB and Seymour Duncan sh for neck. This guitar and electronics sound great. This was a demo model and there are some minor pick marks on the pick guard. The rest of the guitar (front and back) is immaculate! Check the hi-res pictures. I will ship the guitar upon receipt of payment with expedited shipping and fully insured!", "ItemID": "192780568366", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T03:23:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T21:55:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Charvel-Pro-Mod-So-Cal-Style-1-HH-/192780568366", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927805683668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1Nlg2ODE=/z/j80AAOSwg-tcL9Uy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SH4AAOSwlypcL9T0/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FikAAOSwzwVcL9Tq/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1MVg3OTU=/z/jFUAAOSwy6NcL9VF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pywAAOSw19dcL9Tt/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1aMAAOSwjiZcL9T3/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iLEAAOSw0~pcL9Tu/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ewkAAOSw5YlcL9Tw/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI5Nlg4MDQ=/z/glkAAOSw5wNcL9VV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D~wAAOSwH4dcL9To/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Wr8AAOSwJaxcL9T4/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zXYAAOSwVCpcL9Tr/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "27410", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "guitargearjunkee", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 507, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 625.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 625.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 52}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Charvel Pro Mod So Cal Style 1 HH ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["So-Cal Pro Mod"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Seafoam Green"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["2967001549"]}]}, "HitCount": 1345, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "219544550", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Slight wear signs on pick guard (pictured)", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
