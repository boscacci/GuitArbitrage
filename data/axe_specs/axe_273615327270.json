{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar was a very recent purchase. It plays wonderfully and sounds great. In perfect condition. I am only selling as I can't adapt to a 24 fret guitar. Maybe that's a bit goofy, but I have been playing 21 and 22 fret guitars for over 50 years and it's hard to change at this point. Comes as-new with all case (Bag) Candy. This guitar is from the original batch which were made in Korea. The most current guitars are made in Indonesia. Just trying not to totally lose my ass on the resale after fee's and shipping. Here's the skinny from PRS: The PRS SE Custom 24 is the quintessential SE instrument, designed to faithfully reflect the PRS model that started it all. The PRS SE Custom 24 Lefty brings classic PRS playability, reliability, and vibrant tone to the left-handed players of the world.
