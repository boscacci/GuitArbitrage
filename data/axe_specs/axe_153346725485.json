{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Heavily modded Jay Turser. Played a little, not a single coil guy, looking to let someone who is enjoy it. Turser Guitars JT-JG model. Selector switch, 1 Master Volume , 1 MASTER Tone, & 1 Blender, Grigsby 5 way switch. Tortoise pick guard and die cast machines. This model DOES NOT come standard with the 3rd knob we have installed for blending. This is an upgrade! Dot inlays, Adjustable truss rod, Vibrato bridge, Blender knob and Vintage Russian .22 Master Tone Capacitor as well as volume bleed kit so the volume is uniform up/down. This is a Dan Armstrong mod, check out the video on You tube. This Strat style Blender Mod makes the neck pickup tone control a master tone control for all pickups and uses the now free bottom tone control as a blender control. You can add the bridge pickup to the neck and neck+middle switch positions. You can add the neck pickup to the bridge and bridge+middle switch positions. If the blender control is full-on, positions 1 and 5 on the switch are the same (neck+bridge and bridge+neck). So are switch positions 2 and 4. What makes this mod worthy are the tones you get when the blender control is not full-on. If the blender control is on 50%. The neck position on the switch is now 100% neck pickup and 50% bridge pickup.The bridge position on the switch is 100% bridge pickup and 50% neck pickup. Switch positions 1 and 5 are now distinctly different. Switch positions 2 and 4 are also different from each other because each now includes 50% of the neck or bridge pickups. With a few cap (Capacitor) upgrades included and rewiring with classic Cloth wiring this is basically a Dan ArmstrongMOD, plus the treble bleed (cap) added as well to the blender.", "ItemID": "153346725485", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T21:28:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T18:39:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jay-Turser-JT-JG-Guitar-Ivory-Finish-Offset-Fender-Jaguar-Style-/153346725485", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Wray, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533467254858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7WwAAOSwLeFcRLwX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QDoAAOSwveFcRLwq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tfIAAOSw-sVcRL5R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KYQAAOSw2fpcRL6f/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MVkAAOSwCNlcRL63/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-b8AAOSwcDdcRL7R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80758", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "steelers6569", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 435, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 65.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 65.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 96}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jay Turser JT-JG Guitar Ivory Finish Offset Fender Jaguar Style", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jay Turser"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JT-JG"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Ivory White"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["694970200623"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 293, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 66.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
