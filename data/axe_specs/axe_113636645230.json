{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ibanez RG7620 Universe MIJ w/ LoPro Edge Tremolo and DiMarzio Ionizers with a Blaze single coil Upgraded 7620. I want to make it clear that this amazing guitar you see has been customized professionally as close as possible to look like the original Steve Vai Ibanez Universe LNG lochness green 7 string. You can look on the internet if you are unfamiliar with the model. The pickups are DiMarzio Ionizer 7\u2019s and the single is a Blaze. I tried to get the original zebra yellow and green but DiMarzio will only make them in solid yellow or green for 7 strings now in the modern age we\u2019re in. The original was released a long time ago and is almost impossible to find so I decided a awhile ago to have one made but from an Ibanez MIJ guitar that would match the quality of the original. I was lucky enough to find a luthier guitar guy that could do the work in my area too. With everything I paid to have done I could have bought an original for the same price. I just couldn\u2019t find one and I like the aanj or all access neck joint better. It also comes with a Universe case. This is been my go to guitar for just about a year now and I hate to part with it. This guitar plays even better than it looks. The neck is super straight and the frets are immaculate. The Ionizer pick ups sound amazing. This is one guitar that you know it\u2019s going to be 100% amazing to play. The ionizer pick ups have the most clean smooth tone that you could ever get from DiMarzios I\u2019m so impressed with them. They are also Tosin Abasi\u2019s design. I had this done by my favorite Luthier and as you can see from the pictures there\u2019s been no detail overlooked. I\u2019ll be happy to take extra pictures if you would like to see any other angles there\u2019s no crack behind the nut everything is as it should be. It\u2019s in excellent gently used condition. Comes with an Ibanez universe hard shell case Message me if you have any questions Thanks, Daniel", "ItemID": "113636645230", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T07:01:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-13T02:55:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Universe-MIJ-DiMazio-Ionizers-Upgraded-7620-7-String-Guitar-/113636645230", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cocoa, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136366452308080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RvEAAOSw~6hcZHvb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MtkAAOSwHQdcZHvh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8U4AAOSwaAtcZHvc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WSYAAOSwHOtcZHvf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/j~IAAOSwpZpcZHvn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CrUAAOSw~KpcZHvq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WkYAAOSw8uFcZHvt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lBsAAOSwZntcZHvu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/730AAOSwRW9cZHvj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IkYAAOSwDK9cZHvl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I9UAAOSw~SJcZHvg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bDQAAOSwf69cZHvs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32927", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "harmonicsolutions", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 157, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1677.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1677.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 114}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CO", "PA", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Universe MIJ DiMazio Ionizers Upgraded 7620 7 String Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 363, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
