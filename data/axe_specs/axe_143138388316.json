{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 2007 Gibson Explorer '76 reissue electric guitar in excellent condition and in good working order with a gloss nitro lacquer Ebony finish. Well kept for over a decade, this guitar has plenty of power on tap, and these pickups are focused and cutting, with a sound that pushes your amp hard with a tone that compresses nicely and stays tight and manageable especially in high gain scenarios. The solid (and radically shaped) mahogany body adds inherent warmth and fullness to the sound too. The guitar weighs just over 9lbs, with a sweet, natural sustain and rich acoustic resonance that translates well through the pickups. The one-piece mahogany neck has a notably slender C shaped profile that is consistent in depth as you move up the fretboard for a very fast feel. The frets retain their full factory height an. With a 1 11/16\" wide nut and flawless fretwire, the guitar plays effortlessly with no buzzing or dead spots. All of the electronics work as they should, with individual Volume controls for each pickup and a Master Tone control. The stock hardware is all accounted for, with a Nashville bridge and matching stoptail, three black speed knobs, and a three-ply white pickguard. The original Gibson hardshell case is included. The central lock has never been set and still has it's original factory red plastic guard. (the outer latches work as intended).", "ItemID": "143138388316", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T02:07:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-19T02:07:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Gibson-Explorer-76-Re-Issue-/143138388316", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Bruno, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431383883168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/rHQAAOSwaEZcYijI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/JI0AAOSw3qVcYijK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/KH8AAOSwaKVcYijP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/x5QAAOSwEo1cYijT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/Sp8AAOSwY7lcYijZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/-yMAAOSwJtNcYijf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94066", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "e-lutionist", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 48, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 515}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Gibson Explorer 76 Re-Issue", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 64, "Subtitle": "Made inUSA Includes Original Hard Case and Factory Tags", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
