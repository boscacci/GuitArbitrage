This SG is a limited model that is not published in the japanese Tokai Catalog. My opnion. When I look at the Mirror pickguard, I remember Les Paul John Sykes model. And, When I look at the Mirror pickguard of SG, I remember Mr Glenn Tipton in JUDAS PRIEST. In 1984, JUDAS PRIEST visited Japan and made a \" DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH \" Live tour. Mr Glenn Tipton used SG is large size mirror pickguard. And bridge type was a BADASS bridge. But the pickguard size and the bridge type is different, I can say this SG is conscious of Mr Glenn Tipton model. ( In the Tokai line up in \u200b\u200b1984, there was no large size pickguard model of SG. ) And because the accuracy of the product is high, I judged this model to be the original state. ( There are no newly added holes to change the pickguard. ) I guess this SG was made to celebrate JUDAS PRIEST visit to Japan. PRE-LOVED. Long time, It maybe has not been used. It maybe was sleep in warehouse. Thanks to that, Condition is Excellent ! It was manufactured in 1984. It was made about 35 years ago. Although it is an old guitar, I think that the scratch is little. I can not think that it is a guitar made 35 years ago. I have an impression that this guitar is not used much. The evidence is the amount of frets remaining. The remaining amount of the frets are many. If you get this guitar, you will understand that this guitar was used carefully. It keeps a very beautiful state. Tokai made guitars are highly valued around the world. In the past Tokai was producing Burny Fernandes guitars. Made in Japan of Tokai is special. In japan used guitars market, there are many Tokai of made in china. I am wondering, Tokai of made in japan is not see much in used guitars market. The reason is the guitar owners will not let go. Used guitar of Tokai of made in japan, even japanese purchasing is difficult. This TSG50 like a Glenn Tipton model is my first display in eBay. And it maybe last display. I am very very difficult get again the TSG50 of mirror pickguard. About guitar play, Current state, the space between the strings and the frets is standard. And, remaining amount of the Frets are many. Thanks to that, I feel easy to play the guitar. Un pluged sound is very loud. You can feel vibrations transmitted to the body. Pickups are Tokai original 57 PAF model. I feel good distortion sound. I recommend for Heavy Metal music and JUDAS PRIEST Fans !! I played \" You've Got Another Thing Comin' \". I felt it was similar to the sound of Mr Glenn Tipton. By the way the amplifier is VOX Valvetronix. Tokai of made in japan is Great ! It is cleanliness. I polished with guitar exclusive polish, so it is in a very clean state. I after the finger board cleaning, painted beeswax. The aim is moisturizing and and protection. Current neck condition, very good ! roughly straight ! There is no problem with the Truss rod and it can be adjusted. Remaining Frets are 95% on average. You can play immediately after it is delivered to you. All is working well. It is in a very good condition. The Truss rod Wrench is not included.
