Comes with original hard shell case, the original receipt of purchase , two extra string / bridge saddles, and a signed letter of authenticity from Grover Jackson himself thanking the original owner for the purchase of this guitar. Gorgeous marble-like blue and black swirl finish, eye catching and unique in magnificent condition. Schaller bridge / whammy bar licensed under Floyd Rose with locking nut system. This guitar stays in tune like it should, even with the most intense dive bomb whammy use! Guitar has been well maintained and is in amazing condition. There are a few un-noticable nicks and small dings on the front and back of the head stock, very minimal scratches on the front and back surfaces, and two paint chips, one larger found near the cable input and a smaller one located on the neck pickup (see pictures). The case is in very good condition, but the bottom has four button type feet that have caved inside the case. Item sold as is with no returns. Shipped via quality UPS for a flat rate of $60 and I will pay the difference and insurance. The guitar has been set up and plays fast and true. Own and enjoy a rare piece of rock guitar history and watch its value increase. Don't let this rare lady get away!", "ItemID": "132844776103", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T00:30:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-05T02:04:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1989-USA-Jackson-25th-Anniversary-Edition-Super-Strat-RARE-25-46-w-OHSC-/132844776103", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cortez, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328447761038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/3x8AAOSwKA5b36A2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/TKoAAOSwhhlb36A8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/lxkAAOSw~llb36A2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/phcAAOSwHWtb36A2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/5YQAAOSwNWhb36A2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/19UAAOSw6dhb36i0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/-18AAOSwZtRb36it/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/6~0AAOSwfONb36A3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/GN4AAOSwPjhb36ig/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/u4wAAOSwIBpb36A3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/34AAAOSwCgVb36ia/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/55cAAOSw5atb36iS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34215", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "0800eric", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 103, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 133}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1989 USA Jackson 25th Anniversary Edition Super Strat RARE 25/46 w/OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["25/46"]}]}, "HitCount": 777, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
