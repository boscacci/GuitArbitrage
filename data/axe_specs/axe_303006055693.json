{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I picked this guitar up at a store used but still in super nice shape. I have bin scaling back my collection of music gear lately and this item has bin selected to go. When I got the guitar it was missing the trem arm but I had one at home that fit. I think the factory one had a black tip not white. Either way I have never used it. To much issues with tuning for me to whammy a strat. The body and neck are clean and this guitar has bin played very little. I believe there were around 500 of each piece made in this collection. So its a limited run and a nice piece to have in a fender collection. It does play well and sounds as a strat should sound. Nuthing really unique about the electronics. It\u2019s a standard strat. Pickups sound really nice but I have no idea what fender calls them. I am selling it with a nice fender bag I have that is brand new. It\u2019s the tweed look and has a red lining. It pairs up really nice with the guitars color. There may be minor pick marks on guitar and u may need to set the guitar up to suit your playing style. It\u2019s a really clean guitar but not mint new. I will ship to lower 48 only.
