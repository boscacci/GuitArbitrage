{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FENDER JAZZMASTER Electric Guitar, in pink paisley finish with brand new Gator deluxe Jazzmaster-specific gig bag, as shown. Made in Japan, I think in the 2017 model year. Guitar is in MINTY condition cosmetically and operationally: you would be very hard pressed to distinguish this guitar from factory new and this is no exaggeration. Pink paisley finish is simply stunning. Rosewood fingerboard is very nice and shows no evidence of playing wear. Plays and sounds great, has working truss rod and all the electronics work just like new. I have set it up with Ernie Ball Regular Slinkys (.010s). Comes with an extra Jazzmaster wiggle stick (why I got this I do not know but I will pass it on to the lucky winner). As is typical for recent Japanese Fender reissues, this guitar is a very faithful reproduction of the Jazzmasters of the 1960s. Guaranteed to be as described here and sure to please! Will ship to lower 48 US states only due to size and weight of finished package. Winner gets free shipping via FedEx, fully insured. Payment by PayPal only please! Any questions, please e-mail and thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "183679689845", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T22:11:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-10T22:11:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-Pink-Paisley-JAZZMASTER-Elec-Guitar-MINTY-w-new-Gator-gig-bag-JAPAN-MINTY-/183679689845", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Galesburg, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836796898458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Fg0AAOSwn2pcYKFU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/C3AAAOSwOttcYKFW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/niUAAOSwHDdcYKFa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x0oAAOSwf4BcYKFe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o~QAAOSw-pBcYKFj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SxwAAOSweWtcYKFo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e2YAAOSwkNFcYKFr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kjIAAOSwcwdcYKFv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/S20AAOSwyi5cYKFy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RLkAAOSw4ARcYKF2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cBQAAOSwnwpcYKF7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "61401", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "panas_onic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2100, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 14, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 766.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 766.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1404}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER Pink Paisley JAZZMASTER Elec Guitar MINTY w/new Gator gig bag JAPAN MINTY", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["FENDER"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Jazzmaster"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Pink Paisley"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 448, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 776.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar is in MINTY condition both operationally and cosmetically.
