(see below for details).What is a factory used Guitar?Factory used guitars are guitars that we purchase directly from Taylor Guitars. They were either sales samples, used for sales training or another use. Taylor offers us these guitars once or twice a year. Since there are a good amount of these guitars, Taylor doesn't want to have to hand inspect each one for a scratch or a mark. So, they offer them to us as Factory Used. The guitars are set up at the factory, then we hand inspect each one in store. The guitar's specific condition is described in the listing. Any marks/scratches would be noted. We then complete a full factory setup and hand-inspection before shipping. It should also be mentioned that Taylor Guitars Warranty does not apply to Factor Used guitars.
