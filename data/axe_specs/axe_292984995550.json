{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Wow talk about bling bling this guitar is made for the Rockstar someone who wants to make a huge statement. the finish is just insanely bright and screams look at me while I ripped this amazing guitar solo. besides the way it looks it's a great guitar all around. It is all original classic 57 P.A.F humbuckers. comes with the COA from the Gibson custom shop and Original case that is in great Shape.. it has the vibrato Bridge which I loved while playing some Fender Reverb amps. It really adds some flavor to your playing. This was a brief run thatvGibson did in 2007 word is they only made 18 with the sparkle finish which they never did again. and I think there's only made three customs this is one of them. It has a little finished checking around some of the tuners is The Only Fault in the guitar that is worth pointing out the rest is Near mint.I brought this from the original owner who believe it or not brought it to learn how to play guitar .I know right sounds crazy that this would be someone's first guitar they brought to learn on but it was . that is reason it was rarely ever played With no fret wear. the original owner just couldn't pick up how to play guitar. It's a great guitar in the rare guitar great for someone's collection or for playing shows", "ItemID": "292984995550", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T20:24:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-27T19:14:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Gibson-Custom-Shop-S-G-Silver-Sparkle-/292984995550", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Amsterdam, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929849955508080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/PtgAAOSwzd5cdt7v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/vwoAAOSw4AJcdt7x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/xoMAAOSwRolcdt71/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DAMAAOSwj1Vcdt75/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/KjoAAOSw~Kpcdt79/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/VRYAAOSwMexcdt4V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/5AQAAOSwXdlcdt8U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/TLkAAOSwBz1cdt8N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/5OgAAOSwwZJcdt7m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/dokAAOSwLdJcdt-i/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/F58AAOSwa2tcdt-n/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/ZkYAAOSwh5Zcdt-x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "12010", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "madeofmoney717", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 65, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 569}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Gibson Custom Shop S.G  Silver Sparkle", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silver"]}]}, "HitCount": 86, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
