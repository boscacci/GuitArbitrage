{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "B.C. Rich Mockingbird Special X w/ case and Rockfield Pickups!In my opinion, this is one of the best Mocks from overseas made in the last 30 years. Close your eyes, and you will swear the tone is coming straight from a Les Paul. These Rockfield pickups are a perfect match for the maple top/mahogany body combo. Since it's an early to mid 2000s guitar, it is made with REAL mahogany and ebony, not the cheap imitation stuff you pay full price for now. The best thing about this guitar is that the top is pretty close to mint, and all the dings and deep scratches are on the back. There is some buckle rash on the back as well. The frets are in almost unplayed condition, so in my opinion she's had a re-fret or someone has dressed them extremely well. The controls and toggle are recessed into the body, and you also have a neck thru construction, features usually found on much more expensive guitars. If you are looking for a high quality guitar, with great tone for under $600, this is it! This guitar was previously owned by a serious B.C. Rich collector, who took great care of his instruments. Feel free to ask questions or make offer. Please note there are lots of reflections in pictures.
