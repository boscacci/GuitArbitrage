{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fretlight 500 Series Tele model in pristine condition. Judge condition by the pictures, but it's extremely nice and quite hard to tell from a new one. I personally can't find a mark on it. This is the older model that uses the USB cable (included with the guitar.) But if you're not bothered by that it's an excellent buy. When I bought this guitar I'll be honest - I wasn't expecting it to be much other than a cool learning tool. But these things are wonderful instruments overall. Fantastic build quality for no more than they cost. I don't know if it's the poly fret board or the pickups - probably a little of both - but this thing sounds quite nice through my tube amp. Best sustain of any Tele I've ever owned, and I've had a few pretty good Fenders too. I had originally listed this without any software, but just now I found the starter bag of software (see picture), and tools for setup. Also included is a canvas Fender gig bag (not pictured.) Had a question earlier about the special PC cable being included for the guitar. The cable is with it but not in the pictures. Being a used guitar it may require the usual fine tuning and possibly a setup to suit your particular playing style. Sells and ships to lower 48 USA buyers only. Guitar stand in pictures is not included in sale. Bidders with less than 10 items of feedback will not be considered. Sorry, but this is due to the amount of non-paying newbies I've had the past few years.", "ItemID": "113336853557", "EndTime": "2018-11-03T20:20:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T02:19:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Optek-Fretlight-500-Series-Tele-Style-Electric-Guitar-/113336853557", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Monmouth, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1133368535578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3ODk=/z/ywsAAOSwy~Jby1oh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/CrYAAOSw41Jby1oy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTMx/z/3uEAAOSwgKRby1oz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY4WDE2MDA=/z/eH8AAOSwQwFby1oy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDkw/z/31kAAOSwKQFby1oz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/vAwAAOSw4vpby1o0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODQ=/z/7i0AAOSw5qdby1oz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMDMz/z/8n4AAOSwFYZby1oy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDE1OTk=/z/q1YAAOSwORxby1o1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NTA=/z/C9cAAOSwRrlby1o1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMwNFgxNjAw/z/YrgAAOSwdW5b1yq0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "61462", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "buzzkill4u2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 629, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 94}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Optek Fretlight 500 Series Tele Style Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fretlight"]}]}, "HitCount": 90, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 280.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
