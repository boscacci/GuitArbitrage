This guitar has had several modifications to get it as close to an actual 1970s era Thinline as possible. First and foremost, the pickups were replaced with a custom wound set of Curtis Novak Wide Range pickups which are as close to an original set as you can get and truly sound the part. The pots have been replaced with 1Meg pots to give it an authentic tone and the tuners been replaced with vintage accurate reissues. The body and headstock face were oversprayed with a lacquer tint to give it an authentic look. The headstock looks great but the body has some paint dripping on the sides and bottom. With some work this could be removed and smoothed out. All in all a really, really cool looking and sounding guitar! Pro setup in-house and comes with a gig bag.
