{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2007 Fender Custom Shop 1951 Nocaster Relic with Tweed Thermometer Case (6 Pounds 15.5 Ounces) For sale is a mint condition 2007 Fender Custom Shop 1951 \"relic\" Nocaster electric guitar. This model is an exact re-creation of the famed \"nocaster\" guitar. In 1951 Fender was producing the \"Broadcaster\" but Gretsch had legal rights to that name for their drums so for a short period Fender simply clipped of the \"Broadcaster\" text on the headstock decal--hence the name collectors gave it--nocaster. This guitar is a factory relic model so it is aged from the factory to look like a vintage guitar. The relic work on this guitar is very realistic looking. It's not overdone like most of the other relics you see that look fake. This guitar has barely been played and all the ageing on the finish was done at the factory. The guitar has spent its life stored in its case so it looks exactly the way it did when it was purchased back in 2007. It has a real lacquer finish on its ash body that simply looks outstanding. The blonde finish is very transparent so the grain of the ash body shows through nicely. Pickups are stock Fender Custom Shop 51 nocaster pickups and the bridge pickup simply screams. The action is low, neck is straight as an arrow and the guitar plays great. Currently set up with Thomastik-Infeld flatwound strings for that true 50's vintage tone. Strumming the guitar unplugged it has a loud resonant tone due to the ash body. Plug it into a nice tweed amp and it only gets better from there. There are no issues with the guitar and everything works as it should. The guitar is built to vintage specs like a real 51 nocaster would have been. It has the milled jack cup and big heavy knurled knobs. It has a big fat nocaster U shaped baseball bat style neck that measures .958 at 1st fret and 1.00 at 12th fret. Fingerboard radius is the vintage 7 1/4. Playing this guitar is simply as close as you are going to get to know what it's like to play a real Fender 51 nocaster unless you have access to a time machine. Guitar is super light weight at 6 pounds 15.5 ounces on my digital scale. It comes with the original very rare tweed thermometer case which is in mint condition and all the case candy including the unused guitar strap, gray 50's style instrument cable, ash tray bridge cover, custom shop picks, certificate of authenticity, etc. etc. I'm listing this guitar as used simply because it has been strummed a few times but the condition of this guitar is mint \"relic\" condition. You won't find another 11 year old Fender Custom Shop Nocaster in this condition and light weight too!
