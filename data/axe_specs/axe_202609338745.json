{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a very interesting guitar that I bought a few months ago. This is an a true relic, with finish checking, paint rubbed away, tarnishing on the hardware, etc. Please see pics for details. The person I bought it from purchased it in Tokyo. I will include the case you see in the pics, which is a cool old laquered tweed hardshell, made in Japan in the '70's or early '80's. Built in 1975, it is most likely a Greco, although as you can see from the pics the headstock doesn't have a decal any more. I took pics of the markings on the neck heel, although I am not sure what they signify, exactly. Body, neck, tuners, bridge, pickguard, backplate, knobs are from 1975 I bought a new whammy bar for it, which will be included. The pickups are Greco heavy magnet and sound fantastic. Bridge pickup: 5.46k ohm, Middle pickup: 5.24k ohm, Neck pickup: 4.93k ohm The wiring harness has been upgraded to cloth wiring, with a USA Switchcraft 5-way switch, 50s-style BumbleBee condenser, etc. The tone controls have been wired so the tone knobs work with all three pickups. Fretboard is rosewood, neck is straight, truss rod works well and is accessed from the headstock Weight is 7 lbs 7 oz The frets have been relevelled and have plenty of life left. There is some fret buzz, particularly closer to the headstock. It will need to be set up to your taste, but it plays well in general.", "ItemID": "202609338745", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T20:11:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-27T04:15:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1975-Made-Japan-Stratocaster-lefty-Strat-case-Greco-left-handed-/202609338745", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Evergreen, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2026093387458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oKIAAOSwj61cdgsV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zh0AAOSw~jpcdgse/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L-sAAOSwmYFcdgsj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GgkAAOSwuN9cdgss/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Z3gAAOSw~TdcdgtH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ebMAAOSwyutcdgtN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i78AAOSwivlcdgtT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t2YAAOSw9ZtcdgtY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CVUAAOSwufFcdgtf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/beIAAOSwyHJcdgtt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OTEAAOSwFfJcdgt~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GaMAAOSwj1VcdgxX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80439", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "el_fisto", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 519, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 775.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 775.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 750}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1975 Made in Japan Stratocaster lefty Strat with case Greco left handed ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Greco"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["62 Strat-style"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 77, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
