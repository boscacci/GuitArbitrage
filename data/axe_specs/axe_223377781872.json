Includes a Brand New Pro-Lok Gig Bag!Overall condition is Very Good with no real issues to make note of. The treble side horn has some scuffing a shown but nothing structural or major.No longer made and you can get it here at the right price.An axe worthy of a metal master.The Epiphone Tony Iommi Signature G-400 Electric Guitar is what you want for hardcore, heavy hitting sound. Classic SG attitude is enhanced with mother-of-pearl cross fingerboard inlays, black chrome hardware, and a matching black finish on the solid mahogany body. The slim-tapered mahogany neck is fast and the Gibson USA Tony Iommi pickups put out the firepower required for maximum destruction. The Locktone Tune-O-Matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece add sustain and make string changing easier. When you buy from us, expect to receive what you see in the pics. I know the feeling of buying something sight unseen only to find out the seller was not that accurate. I have been selling on Ebay for more than a decade and I am only happy when you are happy! Buyer has 24 hours to contact me and 3 days to complete payment transaction. If this criteria is not met, the item will be sold to someone else. Please keep in mind with shipping, when you buy a guitar from me, you are not just paying for shipping. You are paying for my time and experience in packaging delicate items, as well as the cost of new boxes and shipping peanuts. Thanks. Please email me with any questions and good luck in bidding!", "ItemID": "223377781872", "EndTime": "2019-02-18T01:34:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-09T01:21:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Tony-Iommi-Signature-G-400-Electric-Guitar-/223377781872", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pompano Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233777818728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/XWQAAOSwJaxcJuvs/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/WMgAAOSwjQVcJuvw/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/GcgAAOSwmOBcJuv2/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/NI4AAOSwjiZcJuwC/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/iX4AAOSwvwRcJuwK/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/l9kAAOSw29JcJuwL/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/60kAAOSwmepcJux~/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/moAAAOSwylBcJuyE/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/qCgAAOSw~xtcJuyI/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/~IUAAOSwHrlcJuyL/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/1lYAAOSwTSlcJuyV/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33065", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spinesplitter", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1621, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 470.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 470.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 248}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Tony Iommi Signature G-400 Electric Guitar  ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}]}, "HitCount": 92, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=11691455", "StoreName": "Hear For Music"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very Good", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
