{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Stratocaster Deluxe Roadhouse Stratocaster w/ Plush Gigbag. Condition is Used. Shipped with USPS Priority Mail. I picked this up around 2015 and I'll tell you for sure, you will rarely see this much guitar for the money. Not played enough to justify keeping it - virtually no signs of wear on it. Yes, it's Mexican, but this could be the only guitar you need on stage and will go up against the American Strats easily. While it is on the \"more affordable\" end of the spectrum, I was shocked the first time I picked it up - a few notches above the standard MIM Strat, and maybe some USA Strats! Shipped in it's original box with top-of-the-line Fender Plush gig bag with all the case candy that came with it and vibrato bar; you are getting a very nice package here, practically unused! I have original pearloid pick guard (shown) and will install it if you say so, your call. If not, I will hang on to it and you will get the Genuine Fender Parts replacement (with matching back plate) that is presently mounted on it. Much nicer I think. This video demo says it better than I can: https://youtu.be/qhGdM6ytQBU Fender's Deluxe Roadhouse Stratocaster tears the place down with extra-scorching Strat sound and style. Its three Texas Special single-coil pickups are wired for supercharged tonal versatility, with a special V6 rotary switch (disguised as the middle tone knob) that delivers six distinct onboard-preamp tone settings from wiry single-coil to searing lead. The S-1 switch built into the volume knob bypasses the preamp completely for pure Strat tone.Other features include a tinted maple neck with \"modern C\" profile and large '70s-style headstock, 9.5\"-radius maple or rosewood fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets, five-way pickup switch, four-ply aged white pearloid pickguard, three aged white control knobs (master volume/S-1, V6, master tone), and vintage-style synchronized tremolo bridge.
