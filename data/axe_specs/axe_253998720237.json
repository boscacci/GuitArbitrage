{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This listing is for a Jay Turser JT-200 Pro Electric Guitar Project. It is a Gibson Les Paul knockoff and is in good condition. Some of the tuning posts are a little loose but it doesn't affect intonation at all. I have listed as project as I have swapped out the electronics and bridge. Electronics are GFS Crunchy Rails with KwikPlug pots with coil split on both tone pots- they are very high gain pickups. The bridge is has been replaced with a bridge that has GraphTech saddles. One of the tuners has a chip but does not seem to impact tuning. The guitar will need a setup for your playing style - I have the action where I like it but if you want very low low action , will def need a setup - I did notice that dropping action super low - only fret buzz was on the high e string at 21st fret - so 22nd fret may need spot of work - As its a project guitar - this auction begins at $100. Other than the case, the guitar comes with NO accessories, cables, straps, etc. Sorry, no returns or international shipping. If you have any questions about the listing, please feel free to ask. The guitar will be shipped 3 days (max) after payment.
