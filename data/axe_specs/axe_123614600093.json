{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Excellent to Near Mint Gretsch Pro Jet w/Bigsby Pre-owned by Luthier This guitar is a 1 owner, previously owned by a Birmingham-area luthier, who only played it a handful of times at his church. He greatly improved on the mediocre factory setup by replacing the nut, shaving it down to be able to lower the action, and dressing the frets. The action is set at 5/64\" (I don't remember which fret he was referring to), with that being said this is one of the fastest playing guitars I've owned. The new owner will be getting a guitar that plays and sounds better than a new factory set Pro Jet. The tone sounds much like a Les Paul, of course with the mahogany body/neck, and the maple top, rosewood fretboard. The Gretsch Filtertrons bring out the warmth and sustain of every single note and chord. Finish is much nicer in person, my camera is not great. Excellent to near mint condition.Controls:Master volumeMaster tone2x Pickup volume Case is NOT included but I am selling it, and can combine shipping. It's a TKL/Gretsch This is a great guitar, it will outperform any new Pro Jet from the factory!", "ItemID": "123614600093", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T03:17:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-27T00:52:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gretsch-Silver-Sparkle-Pro-Jet-electric-guitar-Electromatic-Bigsby-maple-top-/123614600093", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Centre, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236146000938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gzUAAOSwxLFcTPuL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FcQAAOSwmE5cTPuj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MSMAAOSw4sNcTPu7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/P1MAAOSwa55cTPvU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FhoAAOSwmE5cTPvy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PSsAAOSwIdVcTPwL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-ywAAOSwEHhcTPw0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xDwAAOSwY4JcTPxP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2i8AAOSw~flcTPxo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LsAAAOSw5wJcTPx9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QKcAAOSwpaVcTPyV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-gEAAOSwrClcTPyw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "35960", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mmorgan57", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 630, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.8, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 8}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gretsch Silver Sparkle Pro Jet electric guitar Electromatic Bigsby maple top", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Pro Jet"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silver"]}]}, "HitCount": 470, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent to Near Mint", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
