{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx, no post office boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement. I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Surf Green Tele\" with some very nice upgrades. The Squier maple/rosewood neck has near zero fret wear ,and has had a nice headstock make over with many coats of cleat over the decal. The Body looks very nice, only mild surface scratches. Guitar features Texas Special pickups,9.3k-neck,10.3k-bridge. All of the pickup cavities and control cavities have been lined with copper foil to control noise. The pots are CTS with a CRL type three way switch,all cloth covered wiring. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The capacitor has been upgraded with a .022 epoxy film capacitor . More range of tone control and a smoother response. Action is great and this guitar wails. Comes with a nice lightly used hardshell case with key. This guitar sounds really good,and it looks like a classic. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! One of the better guitars I have built in a while. A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period!
