{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "FERNANDES RST-50 Strat Guitar Japan Vintage 80\u2019s Electric You are looking at an early 1980\u2019s (see the picture of the neck plate) Fernandes strat guitar in good condition. This guitar is close to a Vintage 50\u2019s Fender including the 7.5 neck radius. Standard \u201cB\u201d type neck profile. As many of you may know Fernandes was threaten with a law suit by Fender. The guitar rings like a bell unplugged. Pickups original and are true Alnico design. The pots are original also. The pots are a bit stiff but they are about 35+ years old. They still work fine. Bridge saddle are stamped with \u201cRevival\u201d Frets are still in good shape. Neck wood has some very nice grain. There are a few wear marks on the neck. The guitar has a nice relic look to it but does not affect the playability in anyway. The original tuners are in good shape. The body has playing wear for a 35+ year old guitar and has a few dings and scratches on it. There is some checking in the finish (small finish cracks) which is Consistent with guitars of this age and finish. When I got this guitar the original pickguard was damaged and I replaced it with a black pickguard. It was very had to find a pickguard where the screws holes match up but I did. It gives it that SRV #1 look in my opinion. The original damaged pickguard will be included with the auction. There is a mark in the body\u2019s finish where the original (white) pickguard was damaged but it is covered by the black pickguard. All defects do not affect the playability of this guitar. Original gig bag is included with the sale. All Sales are final Paypal only.
