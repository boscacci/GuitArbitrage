{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Schecter Special Edition Synyster Gates Custom Solidbody Electric Guitar. The color scheme is the purple/green Joker theme. I know these were made in limited numbers, but I'm not sure how many and what year. They are hard to find. The guitar is awesome and I hate to part with it - like every other guitar player, I have too many and I'm trying to downsize my collection. The guitar plays fantastically, the Seymour Duncan Invader pickups absolutely scream. The death bat inlays on the fretboard are sweet. The tremolo is also top notch, you can dive bomb all day and it stays in tune. The electronics have a coil tap (pull knob), so you can get the single coil sound too. I had it setup by a pro guitar tech and it's tuned to Eb. I used this for a couple gigs, but for the most part it sat in my studio or its case. The only minor minor scratch is on the front of the guitar (please look at the pictures). You can barely see it unless you are right on top of the guitar - from the stage, no one would even see it. Other than that, the guitar is in excellent shape, no buckle rash or anything on the back or neck. Hard shell case included. I apologize for the high shipping cost but: a) guitar+case weigh alot, b) I want to package it up and send it responsibly (give it the care and attention is deserves).
