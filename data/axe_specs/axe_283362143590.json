{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Item up for bid: ESP LTD Koa edition EC-1000 Deluxe guitar (made in South Korea) with its ESP case. There isn't a single flaw on her and she is basically in mint condition (though you can see some of the black paint has worn off the bridge from my hand resting there when playing). It has a gorgeous Hawaiian koa top, an ebony fingerboard, and locking tuners. I bought this guitar almost a year ago and have barely played it due other guitars getting more of my attention. I simply will not play this guitar anymore so I figured I would sell it. I replaced the stock black Seymour Duncan Jazz & Custom5 pickups with chrome Seymour Duncan SH2N Jazz & SH-5 Custom pickups (the bridge pickup has a small mark on it from where the E string hit it). I also replaced the stock strap buttons with Dunlop Straploks. The guitar was set up by one of the best in the area (Dave at Gitterpicker/Twinsburg Music).
