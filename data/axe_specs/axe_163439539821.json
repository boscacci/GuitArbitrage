{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1986 Fender Stratocaster '57 Reissue Tobacco Sunburst with Maple NeckOriginal pickups, neck, tremolo arm, and case Beautiful condition overall with a few marks/scuffs and moderate fret wear as shown. Sounds absolutely amazing with a tube amp and a good distortion pedal. She's the BOMB on everything from Jimi Hendrix to Dire Straits to Stevie Ray Vaughan to Arctic Monkeys. I bought this guitar about five years ago from a player who said he'd had it since 1986, and its neck and pots serial numbers, and case style are consistent with an early Corona era guitar. There is not a date penciled in on the base of the neck, but this isn't unusual during that period at Fender. The neck serial number is V045487. The serial number on the pots is R1378248, indicating the pots were made in the 48th week of 1982. Case is in excellent condition and has a set of new Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings on it. I've tried with all my might to hang onto it during med school but heading into residency I won't have much time over the next four years to rock the house down. Will happily buy it back from you in four years!! You won't be disappointed.", "ItemID": "163439539821", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T21:05:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T02:02:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1986-FENDER-STRATOCASTER-57-Reissue-Excellent-Cond-w-Original-Parts-Case-/163439539821", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Winooski, Vermont", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634395398218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzOVgxNjAw/z/KnkAAOSwamBbcE40/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUxWDE2MDA=/z/dPgAAOSwgStbeifv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQ4WDE2MDA=/z/vD4AAOSwtHZbeigG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rWMAAOSwsUJbcE9C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yPgAAOSwYHZbcE8H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxNVgxNjAw/z/eA4AAOSwTMxbcE7y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vm8AAOSwN91bcE4I/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gYIAAOSwoUZb1fi7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/W2MAAOSwTrVbcE8p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzg4WDE2MDA=/z/TWwAAOSwzf9bcE-z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~lgAAOSwXF9beifW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQyWDE2MDA=/z/qewAAOSw4NVbcE5r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "05404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pluckedpastimeplums", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1227, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1999.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1999.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 126}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1986 FENDER STRATOCASTER '57 Reissue - Excellent Cond. w/ Original Parts & Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["U.S. Vintage Series"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1986"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster 57 Reissue"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Two-tone Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Tremelo Arm"]}]}, "HitCount": 22, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2024.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
