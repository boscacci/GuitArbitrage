{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful Metallic Purple Sparkle 1992 Washburn MG-42 Mercury series Electric Guitar This guitar features: Offset double-cutaway alder bodyBolt-on maple neck24-fret rosewood fingerboard with pearlized offset dot inlays and super clean and smooth frets2 Humbucker configuration w/ push-pull tone knob for a bridge single-coil tap optionWashburn Floyd Rose Pro 600S Tremelo w/ whammy bar and locking neck nutWhite pearlized pickguard with all black hardwareIncludes original allen/hex wrenches on the back of the headstock I'm the only owner, and this guitar has been rarely played over the last 26 years. It is in practically new condition (even still has that new smell)! There are a few issues. See images for very tiny nick in paint in the e-string side cutaway. Also, tone/volume are slightly scratchy when adjusting, and pickup selector can be fussy, particularly in the bridge position. Probably just needs some TLC and a once over on the wire soldering. Set it to 10 and forget it and this thing will wail! Recently restrung with D'Addario NYXL 9s on it. Also included is the original, form-fitting, Washburn Mercury series Hard Shell Case - This thing is $150 original by itself! Check out the pics, fits this guitar like a glove. Case still has original key (and silica packet). And finally, what good is a purple guitar without a Pink Neoprene Guitar Strap - that's included too!", "ItemID": "163331791831", "EndTime": "2018-10-31T00:09:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-24T00:09:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-Mercury-MG-42-Electric-Guitar-w-Hard-Case-Floyd-Rose-Tremelo-/163331791831", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hudson, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633317918318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bncAAOSw8MJbz6U3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MDg=/z/CwgAAOSwfPlbz6U2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTA=/z/8OIAAOSwFURbz6U2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzMxWDE2MDA=/z/NL8AAOSwjNdbz6U2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjg1/z/hrQAAOSwlJBbz6U4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTkz/z/x0YAAOSwKcRbz6U4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1ODA=/z/KCEAAOSwNWhbz6U2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/pr8AAOSwzvFbz6f2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE0MlgxNjAw/z/HlIAAOSwJ6Nbz6U3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzIyWDE2MDA=/z/4IwAAOSwXHxbz6U4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01749", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dustin_mb", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 45, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 8, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 170.01, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 170.01, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 613}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn Mercury MG-42 Electric Guitar w/ Hard Case & Floyd Rose Tremelo\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1992"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["mg-42"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Purple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 281, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 172.51, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
