I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a cool Squier Neck SX Body Custom Shack Tele Deluxe with Tremolo and many upgrades. The maple/rosewood 22 fret neck has near zero fret wear and came from a Squier Standard Series. The headstock has had a nice makeover with many coats of clear over the decal . The SX Body looks great,has one rub mark on the edge,otherwise just light surface scratches. Body features a high mass two point tremolo and has great sustain. I upgraded the pickups with some very hot nickel Epiphone Les Paul Slash AFD pickups,about 12k-neck,17k-bridge. I also upgraded the stock tone capacitors with mylar film capacitors. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting, clean or with some distortion. Action is good and could probably lowered even more. Guitar plays,looks,and sounds great. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is.
