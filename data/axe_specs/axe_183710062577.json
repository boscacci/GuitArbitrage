{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 100% original 1984 Fender Squire JV Stratocaster in the rare Fiesta Red color. the guitar is in excellent condition and plays andsounds amazing. This guitar is the one that everyone wants and is highly collectible especially in the rare Fiesta Red color. This wasa limited production 62 reissue model made for export. most of these early eighties JV strats were shipped to England and very fewin the Fiesta Red color. This guitar comes with a very nicely padded and good quality gig bag. this guitar just keeps increasing in value over the years. its a great guitar and i have been told i should not sell it as i will not find another one as nice as this one. Absolutelyno disappointments in this instrument as nothing has been changed or altered and is just as it came from factory in 1984.i just do not play it much anymore. It deserves a good home.
