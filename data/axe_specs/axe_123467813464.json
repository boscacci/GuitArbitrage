{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello, just clearing out some great items from my musical collection for no other reason than to create space for\u2026..well, more space! Space is great! Check out my other auctions for more musical gear related goodies. (Multi-track recorders, guitars, etc.) Up for purchase is a Korean made Danelectro Blue Sparkle Hodad Electric Guitar with Danelectro branded Bigsby style Tremolo. These were made anywhere from 1999-2001 around the time when Danelectro started their reissues again. It is in overall good condition with little fret wear but lots of life left. The blue sparkle finish is definitely an eye catcher. Some yellowing on the knobs from age. Humbucker Lipstick style pickups with Pull/Push tone knob split coil controls. Roller bridge and \"D\" tremolo. Here's a really cool link to site where a guy talks about this exact guitar in depth: http://chasingguitars.com/1999-danelectro-hodad-with-bigsby/ It could probably use new strings and a \"set-up\" for maximum playability and comfort. Plays decent but I'm leaving that up to you. Guitar stand not included.Now for the boring part. Buyer pays a flat rate shipping charge of $65.00 to any location in the continental U.S.A. Sorry, but No International Bids, Sales or Shipping here, Thank you. This item will be packaged by me personally with great care. I try and describe all my items with the most detail and accuracy, but if you feel I missed something or you need to know anything more, Please feel free to ask any questions before you purchase. Thank you for your time! Cheers, and God Bless!", "ItemID": "123467813464", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T21:18:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-03T21:13:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Danelectro-Blue-Sparkle-Hodad-Bigsby-style-Tremolo-Electric-Guitar-Korean-/123467813464", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Orlando, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234678134648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/JAQAAOSwzHFb3guv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/9SoAAOSwhrFb3gu3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/LFYAAOSwfcNb3gu7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/3BMAAOSwd2Zb3gu9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ppUAAOSwmBhb3gvA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/-WEAAOSwBgZb3gvD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Re4AAOSwDDRb3gvG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BCAAAOSwTiVb3gvJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/PG0AAOSw0vJb3gvN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/TpgAAOSwT-pb3gva/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/qfMAAOSwE4tb3gvb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/z3QAAOSwhX5b3gve/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32812", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dickiehead", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1056, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2719}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Danelectro Blue Sparkle Hodad with Bigsby style Tremolo Electric Guitar Korean", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Danelectro"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 758, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
