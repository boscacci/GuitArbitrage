{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "REALLY COOL VESTER ELECTRIC GUITAR - INCLUDES HARD SHELL CASE One of a kind Vester guitar with Floyd Rose and custom painted graphic. These Vesters were well made guitars. Both the body and the neck on the JAR 1400 are super slim, kind of like an Ibanez Sabre. The specs from the Vester catalog: \u00b7 Double Arch Alder Body \u00b7 Hard Maple Slim Neck With Rosewood Fretboard \u00b7 Double Locking Floyd Rose Tremolo (I don\u2019t have the whammy bar) \u00b7 2 Single Coils And 1 Humbucker Low Noise High Impedance Pickups \u00b7 5-Way Pickup Selector Switch With 1 Coil Tap Switch \u00b7 1 Volume & 1 Tone Control \u00b7 Gotoh Diecast Machine Heads \u00b7 Round Slanted Heal \u00b7 Anchor Bolt Neck Joint \u00b7 Allen key holder behind headstock for tremolo (no allen keys, easy to buy though at Home Depot) Vesters were really nice guitars manufactured in the 1990\u2019s in Korea. They were specified by an Illinois music store called Samuel music. You can read more on Wikipedia and the web. This one has a Nagal style artwork film overlay on the body signed by an artist named Pike. Nagal was an artist who is known in art circles for his signature 1980\u2019s style. From Wikipedia: Patrick Nagel (November 25, 1945 \u2013 February 4, 1984) was an American artist. He created popular illustrations on board, paper, and canvas, most of which emphasize the female form in a distinctive style descended from Art Deco. He is best known for his illustrations for Playboy magazine and the pop group Duran Duran, for whom he designed the cover of the best-selling album Rio. This guitar is in very good condition. The neck is in great shape. It is one of the slimmest I have ever played on, very fast and smooth. Has just a few very fine nicks. I didn\u2019t realize they were there until I examined the neck to write this listing. The overlay artwork has quite a few very fine bubbles and a few small chips but is well done and looks good. You don't notice these unless you look for them. There are a couple of nicks on the back of the body, but nothing significant at all. The Dean case IS included! Make me an offer! Shipping is $45 flat for the lower 48 states and actual shipping to Alaska or Hawaii. Good Luck!
