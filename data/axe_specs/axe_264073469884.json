{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2011 Synyster Special (Gothic Logo) This one does not include a case and is not in as good of shape as my other one thats listed for sale. The black chrome Schecter tuners have been swapped out for black chrome locking Schecter tuners as this was a tremelo-locked guitar to change tuning easily. The locking nut blocks and screws and tremelo arm are not original but were replaced with black to flow with the other black hardware mixed in with black chrome. Black chrome does not seem to be available in the aftermarket. The knobs were changed to black chrome to remove the obvious-ness of being a signature guitar. The headstock also has some cracks at the horn that COULD be repaired if somebody really wanted to but it is not at all necessary. This guitar's gloss black finish does show scratches throughout, but nothing major! No noticeable Dings, or Dents other than the cracks in the headstock horns mentioned above. SHIPPING TO THE LOWER 48 STATES ONLY. PAYPAL ONLY. NO RETURNS. DETAILED PICTURES ARE PROVIDED. LOOK AT THEM BEFORE BIDDING. Ask any questions you have or ask for more photos before bidding.
