I think the necks warp is a slight sort of sled. The truss rod is unconfirmed because there is no tool. There is about 5 cm bite on the back of the neck (per 5 frets). The metal part also polished shiny but the corrosion crush could not be removed. There is a slight gully in the torque switch and the rear tone. Although there is no big damage seen on the body table, the back has multiple dent scratches. After photographing the main body, the part whitened due to abrasion was touched up with acrylic paint. The string has been re-assigned to Dadaario EXL 120 (9/11/16/24/32/42) at 11 / mid.
