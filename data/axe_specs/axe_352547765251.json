The guitar was very lightly used for digital recording of certain songs that required the Jackson tone and tremolo. This guitar is in mint condition with the exception of one small scuff on the face of the guitar which is very hard to see depending on the angle (please see pics). The neck is super fast as you would expect from a guitar of this caliber and the tremolo is insane. This listing provides a tremendous opportunity to buy a superior Jackson guitar for a fraction of the current selling price. Additional Terms and Conditions Shipping of $50 is to the lower 48 only.
