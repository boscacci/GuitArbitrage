{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a nice Godin Detour electric solid-body guitar. Assembled in the U.S. from Canadian parts. Nice S-shape guitar with two humbuckers. Sounds good, plays well. A few minor signs of usage, but nothing significant and they're hard to see. No gouges, chips or breaks in the wood. Small ding on head stock. Just had intonation done and new strings are on it. Comes with a very nice Godin gig bag, better quality than most other gig bags. Only selling because I have a few too many guitars and they're not getting played like they should. And I'm running out of room for them. Payment via PayPal expected within two days of auction close. Will pack securely and ship promptly. Lower 48 states only, NO international shipping.", "ItemID": "232982398724", "EndTime": "2018-11-03T13:45:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-27T13:45:31.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Godin-Detour-Electric-Guitar-U-S-made-nice-condition-Godin-gig-bag-/232982398724", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Weaverville, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2329823987248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/besAAOSwQ5pb1Glv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/otMAAOSwNpRb1GmH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3z0AAOSwVcZb1Gmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EZwAAOSw8cFb1Gmq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28787", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dionysis51", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1159, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.6}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 189.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 189.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 10}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Godin Detour Electric Guitar, U.S.made, nice condition with Godin gig bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Godin"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 209, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 191.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
