{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Sweetwater recently began offering an exclusive PRS SE Custom 24 solidbody electric guitar. SE Custom 24 instruments offer the sound, playability, and gorgeous looks of the Custom line, all packed into a high-quality, affordable instrument. This guitar\u2019s mahogany body and rosewood top hold two great-sounding PRS-designed SE 85/15 humbucking pickups. It has 3-piece maple neck with a wide-thin shape for very easy playing. White binding outlines the instrument for an even more stunning appearance. The contoured mahogany body gives the SE Custom 24 a perfect balance of rich midrange and top-end clarity (and the beautiful rosewood top veneer helps make this instrument a real looker). Add a pair of PRS-designed humbuckers in the bridge and neck positions, and you've got a recipe for thick, sustaining tones. Pull up on the tone pot, and you'll access chiming, bell-like single-coil sounds. Appointments exclusive to Sweetwater: Though all PRS SE Custom 24 solidbody electric guitars are beautiful, this Sweetwater exclusive model boasts some aesthetic appointments that we believe sets it a step above. The rosewood top features rich, deep brown hues, and it is perfectly offset by this guitar body's white binding. Finally, a beautiful rosewood veneer is applied to the guitar's headstock. Features: White body binding Beautiful matching headstock design Legendary PRS quality and playability Beautiful rosewood top gives the guitar an elegant look Mahogany body for punchy tone and long sustain PRS-designed tremolo maintains tuning under heavy use PRS SE 85/15 pickups sound great humbucking or single-coil Push-pull tone knob accesses great single-coil-type tones Wide-thin maple neck is comfortable and fast This guitar has only left my smoke-free home only once, and is in out-of-the-box condition. It comes with a cool brown PRS gig bag. I hate to see this one go, but it\u2019s either me or the guitar. Enough said. Please give this superb instrument a good home. 1.Now for the fine print: 2.Once the item has been purchased, the buyer must contact me within 24 HOURS! 3.U.S. buyers must provide a confirmed ship-to address.
