Description *************************************************************************Made in 1997. Riviera is a semi-acoustic guitar with a center block structure, an epiphone version of Gibson ES-335. Like 335, it is a charm of warm sound with air feeling and looks of vintage sunburst. Although the appearance has a feeling of use such as scratches and dent marks as an age, there are few noticeable scratches. The metal plate of the rear tone knob is missing. The neck is straight, and the truss rod is enough. About 70% of frets remain. There is no problem with hardware such as pegs and electrical components. There are some scratches on the original hard case, but the functional side is solid. Weight about 3.8 kg \u3010accessories\u3011 Genuine hard case************************************************************************* Payment We accept PayPal only.Please make a payment within 3 days after send my invoice.
