{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Thanks for checking out my auction. Please see my other Kramer up for auction. So up for auction is a very nice Kramer Nagel Art guitar. This was a Project guitar I bought years ago and after putting together and playing for awhile it's just been hanging up on the wall as part of my collection. That being said this was a part's guitar which my definition means I bought it in parts and assembled myself. Body I believe is a Baretta Special Reissue, the art work and finish is very good quality, volume knob has been modified as the nipple and the quote \"Get me off\" on the bottom side of the body. I don't remember where the neck came from but it's a original Kramer American with Schaller Germany tuners. Neck is straight. Same with the Neck plate, bought off ebay to complete set up. Has a Floyd Rose Special and a Seymour Duncan Humbucker (Don't remember the model number, but hopefully can get that info shortly). Guitar is in very good condition, Sounds and plays decent, Looks great! Since the guitar has been hanging for some time it will definitely need a good setup, Such As: new strings, bridge adjustment and cleaning. Gig bag will be included. Guitar will be packed very well and insured. USA Bidders ONLY. No Returns! This guitar has been described to the best of my knowledge and accurate detail along with photo's from all views. Please ask any questions before bidding.", "ItemID": "323647043687", "EndTime": "2019-01-20T03:36:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-13T03:36:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kramer-Nagel-Guitar-Project-Parts-Playable-L-K-/323647043687", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Columbus, Mississippi", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236470436878080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BncAAOSwPGtcOqwx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QFkAAOSwJFBcOqxO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/W44AAOSwhEhcOrC9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1vEAAOSwXTVcOrDU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gZYAAOSwwPRcOrDi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/KdAAAOSwvEhcOqy3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3XMAAOSws~pcOqzV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n0MAAOSwlThcOrDu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RlcAAOSwZltcOq0T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JcIAAOSwWz5cOrDH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WBEAAOSwgb1cOrF9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjA4/z/c54AAOSwo6NcOrOo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "39705", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "marty-5", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 917, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 29, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 882.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 882.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Kramer Nagel Guitar/Project/Parts/Playable...
