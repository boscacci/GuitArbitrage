{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a very cool guitar! If you're not familiar with The Gibson Invader, look them up. Made in the early 80's by Gibson USA, it's basically a Les Paul with a bolt on neck, supposedly requested by Jeff Beck. It's a solid hunk of Mahogany. The pickups and electronics are all original as is the body. The neck and tuners are replacement, done by a pro Luthier. Included in the sale is an original dealer slick in new condition see pics. Also included is the original neck see pics. We decided that the original neck should not be used due to the fact that it had been repaired., and looks iffy. So we went with a new neck that had to be shimmed, see pics. She's straight, with a fresh set up and strings. Intonation is spot on, action is good. Usual minor blemishes for an axe of this age, see pics. She's ready to plug in and play! Will ship in a gig bag. I'll ship to the lower 48 states, USA to a PayPal verified address only, no international shipping.", "ItemID": "264082616355", "EndTime": "2018-12-12T15:43:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T19:26:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Invader-/264082616355", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Milton, Delaware", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640826163558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/dl8AAOSw4bhcDr2S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/8acAAOSw-FRcDr2V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ya8AAOSwOHpcDr2Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/QW8AAOSwuQhcDr2d/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/xXcAAOSwXItcDr2i/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Qx0AAOSwC45cDr2m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Ke4AAOSwb15cDr2o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Tk0AAOSwWIJcDr2q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/vmkAAOSwn01cDr2t/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/6ygAAOSwN3NcDr2x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/gVoAAOSwBMpcDr20/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Bw4AAOSwEwhcDr23/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "19968", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "410photoguy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 58, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 121}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Invader", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}]}, "HitCount": 118, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 255.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
