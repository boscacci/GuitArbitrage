{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A truly fantastic 2006 Fender American Stratocaster in the much coveted Lake Placid Blue with a matching headstock. There are no dings, dents, damage or issues with this guitar whatsoever. I purchased this guitar new and it has been kept in a smoke free environment and in its molded Fender case (also included) when I'm not playing it. I did change out the standard pick guard for the anodized gold one shown in the pictures. I will include the original guard which was a parchment guard. The pickups are Fender Noiseless pickups with standard Strat switching. The neck is dead straight and shows almost no fret wear. I have polished each fret for super smooth bending. Action is nice and low and is currently set up for 10s. Though not pictured the tremolo bar is also included. I'll answer any questions but will only be able to do so during evening hours.", "ItemID": "123546875434", "EndTime": "2018-12-28T00:32:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-16T05:42:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-Fender-USA-Stratocaster-Lake-Placid-Blue-Matching-Headstock-/123546875434", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Jackson, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235468754348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/KCAAAOSwdHpcFeGv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/UzEAAOSwIKNcFeFJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/6tcAAOSwH1pcFeFk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/gocAAOSwuJRcFeFj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/ftgAAOSw3T5cFeHG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/N6QAAOSwlypcFeHZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/U0kAAOSwIKNcFeFh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/m2cAAOSwIS9cFeFk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1LUAAOSwT1hcFxXy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "63755", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wtoliver7515", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 291, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 925.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 925.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "8***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 279}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2006 Fender USA Stratocaster - Lake Placid Blue With Matching Headstock", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 234, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
