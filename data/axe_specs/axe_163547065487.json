{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Welcome to the sale of yet another cheeky Japanese made Martin replica. Yet unlike the others in the crowd, this particular company made quite literal copies that sound way above and beyond most. Made in Nagoya, Japan forty years ago by high class builder - Hayashi. These lively guitars have a cult following today and we have many professional musicians on our books that gig these guitars. With a certain sense of audacity, this one has the 'C.F Mountain' branding, much to C.F Martins' amusement no doubt - has more character and tone than many real D18's, no question. \u221e Professionally refurbished and set up \u221e Action good, nice to play \u221e Bridge system installed to preserve bridge and soundboard \u221e Excellent mojo with a superb depth of tone \u221e Structure, neck and frets in great shape \u221e Cosmetics showing expected traces of use of 40 years, not mint but cool We have owned, played and restored most of the C.F Mountain models and they all make for great guitars, many gig these and leave the Martin at home, even just for the wry humour, these are just great guitars to have around. \ud83c\udfbc Pro refurb \ud83c\udfbc Free UK+EU Ship (USA discounted as priced) \ud83c\udfbc 70's classic blaster Enjoy!
