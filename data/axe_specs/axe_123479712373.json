{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I RECENTLY TOOK THIS IN AS TRADE FROM MY DRUMMER. ITS A 2010 FENDER BLACKTOP TELECASTER THAT IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. HE IS A DRUMMER AND REALLY NEVER PLAYED IT. IT HAS 2 VERY MINOR BODY BLEMISHES. OTHER THAN THAT, ITS JUST POLISH SWIRLS. THE PLASTIC FILM IS STILL ON THE PICKGUARD. IT HAS A SOLID ALDER STRINGTHRU BODY WITH A GREAT BELLY CUTAWAY(UNLIKE MOST TELES). IT HAS A DUAL HUMBUCKER DESIGN WITH 3 WAY TOGGLE SWITCH, VOLUME AND TONE. I CHANGED OUT THE ORIGINAL FENDER MEXICAN HUMBUCKERS. THEY WERE JUST TOO MUDDY WITH NO DEFINITION. IT IS NOW LOADED WITH A SET OF CUSTOM WOUND ALNICO V HUMBUCKERS. THESE ARE WOUND TO THE SAME SPECS AS THE SEYMOUR DUNCAN 59 SET. BUT THESE HAVE A MORE PRONOUINCED BOTTOM END AND SLIGHTLY SMOOTHER HIGHS AND UPPER MIDS. BELIEVE ME, THESE ARE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT. THEY ARE RUN THROUGH A PUSH/PULL TONE POT. WHEN PULLED, IT WILL RUN THE HUMBUCKER IN SINGLE COIL MODE. THE NECK IS THE FENDER MODERN C PROFILE WITH A 1 11/16 NUT. IT HAS ZERO FRET WEAR. IT WAS BASICALLY NEVER PLAYED. IT HAS 22 MEDIUM JUMBO FRETS. THE FRETS WERE JUST POLISHED AND THE FRETBOARD WAS JUST CLEANED AND OILED. IT IS EXTREMELY VERY WELL SET UP WITH VERY LOW ACTION WITH ERNIE BALL 10-46 STTINGS. IT WILL INCLUDE A FENDER SOFT CASE. I WILL TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SHIPPING IS TO THE CONT. US ONLY. I WILL SHIP INTERNATIONALLY, BUT ONLY THROUGH EBAYS GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. PLEASE MAKE PAYMENT OR CONTACT WITH ME WITHIN 72 HOURS OF WINNING.
