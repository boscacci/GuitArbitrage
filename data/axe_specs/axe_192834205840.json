{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a 1964 Epiphone Granada E444T hollow body electric guitar. It has plenty of life left and is an easy player. There are a number of nicks and scratches \u2013 as expected for a working guitar made in 1964. The neck is straight and true, and the action is good and medium/low. It has the original tuners. There was a professional luthier headstock repair done in 1999 (cat knocked it off the stand... you know the story). It's not super obvious. Head and neck are rock solid and have no issues. The fret board has the usual low spots from regular playing in the first three positions. They do not affect playability. The frets are in very good condition up and down the neck. There are no cracks in the body. Lots of nice crazing. Nice new hardshell case included. I'm primarily a bluegrass acoustic guitar player and have hardly played this guitar since I got it. It's been kept in a humidified case and smoke-free environment. I'm pricing it to sell! Feel free to ask questions, request more photos and/or make a reasonable bid/offer. Shipping and handling paid by buyer. Insurance paid by seller on shipped item. Free pickup in Eastern Massachusetts.
