Originally designed to be easier to build, andthus more affordable, Leo Fender's masterpieces, which include classics likethe Stratocaster (is there a more distinctive guitar shape in the world?), theTelecaster and the original Precision Bass, were at the core of a musicalrevolution that spawned everything from surf to country to punk!In the 1960s, when Fender guitarsfirst hit bandstands and stages all around the country, it was astonishing tosee that trademark Fender maple neck and fingerboard. Though the companyeventually offered rosewood fingerboards as standard or optional on its entireline of instruments, those first\"blond\" necks really shook things up.Others have picked up on the maple neck theme, but it's clearly yet another ofLeo Fender's \"firsts.\"Today,no other manufacturer can match Fender for the sheer number of optionsavailable throughout its entire line. While vintage Fenders can commandastronomic prices, the company now has the widest range of quality instrumentsin the world, along with the highest profile players like Eric Clapton, JeffBeck, Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan, all of whom are legendary.
