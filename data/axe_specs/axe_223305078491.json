{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling a 2011 Ernie Ball Music Man JPXI 7 String John Petrucci signature guitar. These guitars are in a league of their own quality wise and definitely built for speed and ease of playing. The ebony fretboard is super smooth when playing and the 20\" radius and stainless steel frets make playing this guitar addicting. The Dimarzio Crunch Lab and Liquifier pickups sounds awesome. They nail that Periphery tone really good if that's the type of tone you're going for, but they're also very versatile. The finish is called black onyx and looks very unique, it looks best under direct light. It has a tremol-no installed used to block the trem, I never felt the need to use it because this thing never goes out of tune thanks to the Schaller M6-IND locking tuners with pearl buttons. I do not have the back plate or the trem bar so they will not be included. The only blemishes that it has is part of the finish on the side of the neck on the high strings, specifically on the 9th and 16th frets and a little on the 15th and 14th, has chipped of because a drummer bumping into it while carrying his equipment. Honestly, you do not feel it at all when playing and you will forget that they're there. Even when you run your fingers over it to feel it it's barely noticeable, just looks a lot worse than it is. It's an easy fix for any luthier you take it to. Also a friend of mine had pickup rings installed professionally, I took them of\u00a0 because I didn't like them, but you can see where they where and even that you will forget about unless you look for it. All in all this guitar plays and sounds amazing and the\u00a0 stainless steel frets seem to last forever. It comes with the original Music Man\u00a0 JPXI 7 hardshell case. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks for looking.
