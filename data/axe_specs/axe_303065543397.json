{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This made in Kalamazoo 1977 RD Artist is in all original condition, including all of the original hardware and electronics.\u00a0 This is the top RD model which featured the full complement of Moog designed electronics with the expander/compressor functions.\u00a0 The active pickups and all of the electronics have been tested and function properly. This guitar just received a fresh set up and had the switch contacts cleaned.\u00a0 The action was able to be set nice and low due to it having a nice straight maple neck and level original frets which show little wear. The finish shows typical wear for a 42 year old guitar that has seen some play time, but certainly not heavy wear.\u00a0 There is one small chip in the lacquer along the edge of the fretboard, as pictured, which I do not notice at all when playing the guitar.\u00a0 The control cavity covers show slight warping which is pretty typical for this model. Weight - 9 lb 9 oz. The original hardshell case is included.\u00a0 The latches and hinges are all original, and all function properly. Please see my photos for the instruction manual for the electronics.", "ItemID": "303065543397", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T03:18:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-17T15:30:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1977-Gibson-RD-Artist-Black-All-Original-OHSC-Moog-Electronics-/303065543397", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Greenville, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030655433978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/H~kAAOSwk1hcaXxS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTMy/z/klQAAOSwZcZcaXxO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/JGMAAOSwDNZcaXxI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/Zj4AAOSwYS5caXxM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/0TYAAOSwLgVcaXxU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/V1kAAOSwSjpcaXxc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/FlIAAOSwCV5caXxf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/fGAAAOSwhW1caXxj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY0/z/2WQAAOSw2NhcaXxl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/XfgAAOSwo3xcaXxp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/oYsAAOSwzOxcaXxr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTY3WDc1MA==/z/nbMAAOSwdfVcaX2n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29607", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thatrhythmman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 724, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 57}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1977 Gibson RD Artist - Black - All Original with OHSC - Moog Electronics", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1977"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RD Artist"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1977"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 100, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
