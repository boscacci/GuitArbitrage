{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello! For sale is my rare 1988 Charvel Model 6 in a gorgeous red lava crackle finish. The auction is No Reserve! Offers welcome.I have owned this guitar for many years and hardly ever play it. The condition it is currently in is the condition that I received it in. I wish it was better for you but I hope it still goes to a good home.There are several noticeable blemishes. The first being buckle rash on the back which is colored black. The next is on the face of the headstock right under the Charvel logo. And the tip of the headstock, as well, has some chipping. On the low E string side there is a crack in the finish from where the nut is. The upper horn also has some finish damage. The strap buttons and cavity covers/truss rod cover are not there. Everything else is original and everything works. Comes with the whammy bar, hardshell Charvel case (no key), and some extra bridge parts. The guitar plays great and the neck is straight. **U.S. Bidders Only** Shipping is to the lower 48 states and will ship via USPS.", "ItemID": "273525907837", "EndTime": "2018-11-04T20:26:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-25T20:26:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1988-Charvel-Model-6-Red-Fire-Lava-Magma-Crackle-Rare-Japan-Case-No-Reserve-/273525907837", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Antonio, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735259078378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N1QAAOSwMO9b0hx3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Zo8AAOSwKO5b0hxo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YPMAAOSwIUpb0hxm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HscAAOSwxLdb0hx0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0KUAAOSwI~Vb0hx4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/B6EAAOSwE9Bb0hx3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MawAAOSwZtNb0hxv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Xy0AAOSw4M5b0hxt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OjgAAOSwmBhb0hxu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uMcAAOSwaXpb0hxp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Rw8AAOSwfoJb0hx3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uXEAAOSwsRVb0hx3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "78258", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jaime2572", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 530, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 24, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 48}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1988 Charvel Model 6 Red Fire Lava Magma Crackle Rare Japan Case No Reserve!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Model 6"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Multicolor"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1988"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 891, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 620.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Has many signs of wear in the finish as noted in the description and are visible in the pictures.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
