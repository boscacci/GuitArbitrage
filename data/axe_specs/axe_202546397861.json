{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This great playing ESP/LTD EC-1000 has a great look with the silver burst finish and black EMG pickups. The neck plays fast and clean and the pickups have a great voicing as well. There is one small cosmetic issue on the back of the cutaway a small chip in the finish, you can not see it from the front,or from the back, but from the underside (pictured above) it is there, aside from that it looks great and plays even better. Includes a black ESP hard shell case. This guitar is a tone machine and beautiful as well, you will not be disappointed in this guitar, neck is straight and the action is low.", "ItemID": "202546397861", "EndTime": "2018-12-27T02:36:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T03:16:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-EC-1000-Silverburst-EMG-81-60-Active-Pickups-/202546397861", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Crosby, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025463978618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-egAAOSwPg9b-10s/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Wy0AAOSwa3Fb-10u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5pwAAOSwlLlb-10z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HKcAAOSwB5lb-10m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Z-YAAOSwusdb-10q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xXsAAOSwMOtb-100/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TFwAAOSwoZlb-10w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aLQAAOSwkelb-103/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QpQAAOSwORxb-10o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "77532", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wentzelswonders", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 489, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 689}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP LTD EC-1000 Silverburst with EMG 81/60 Active Pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Eclipse"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silver Burst"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut", "Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["EC-1000"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["LEC1000BLK"]}]}, "HitCount": 63, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "72431806", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This great playing ESP/LTD EC-1000 has a great look with the silver burst finish and black EMG pickups.
