{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Needs a new loving home. Peavey T-60 Guitar Serial Number 00291310 (built in 1978) with original hard case (speakers not included)Purchased in a Houston Pawn Shop in 1988, because Johnny 'Clyde' Copeland played one. Here's a pic of Mr. Copeland with his Peavey T-60 http://thebluesmobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jcopeland-335x256.jpg Has been well kept in a smoke free home,has a new set up and strings. There was no decal on the headstock when I bought it, but I have a replica that you can apply if you desire, which is included in the purchase As I own more guitars than I have space for, and I'm playing bass more than guitar these days, I have to (sadly) let a couple of them go. About this guitar: The Peavey T-60, is the top of the range electric guitar of the versatile Peavey T-series, named after chief guitar designer Chip Todd, who worked for Peavey Music Corp. This T-60 can truly be considered as one of the best, but underrated guitars from the 1970s era. Made in the U.S. between 1976and 1987, the Peavey T-series was perhaps Peavey\u2019s most prominent solid body type guitar made during that era, and the first guitar the brand ever produced. Many believe the T-Series and particularly T-60 has been grievously overlooked when examining historically great guitars. Though it is heavy, like many Peavey products from this time period, players have found that the tones of these guitars are varied and unique that it more than makes up for the instrument\u2019s weight. Even the body moulded case is a work of art. - https://elitevintageguitars.com/peavey-guitars/peavey-t-60-2/", "ItemID": "273708403029", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T12:55:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T12:55:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1978-Peavey-T-60-Guitar-w-Original-Case-/273708403029", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Brooklyn, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2737084030298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/l~gAAOSwKhFcaqX9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/188AAOSwzd5caqX7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/3-IAAOSwPEhcaqX8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7g0AAOSwEo1caqX8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7h4AAOSwQFhcaqX7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/q4YAAOSwgs5caqYi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/fjgAAOSwGrVcaqX9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/FZAAAOSwkGJcaqX9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11216", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bigted745", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 318, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 8, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 333.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 333.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 25}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1978 Peavey T-60 Guitar w/ Original Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 538, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 338.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
