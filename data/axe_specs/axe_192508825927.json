{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello ! Up for sale is a really cool and excellent sounding/playing electric guitar, especially for the price point.....the SG Special by Epiphone, a Gibson company ! Something about the look of an SG, just grabs you by the horns, literally ! And once you are done gushing over that, you go to play it acoustically, and are so pleased at how comfortable and fun this classic axe is to play ! Plug it into an amp (we have TONS in our ebay store if you need one) and the amazing experience really ramps up as you can hear the sparks fly when this guitar is electrified! Folks, this IMHO is going to be what you get when you buy ANY SG style guitar. And for the price range and the condition this particular guitar is in, you cannot beat this deal, especially since it's the genuine article...the real deal...an EPIPHONE ! So buy it now before someone else snags it because they realize what a terrific value and amazing piece of equipment this guitar is ! Here is an instrumental done with the SG, played through an Orange Tiny Terror 15 w/Celestion Greenback, also for sale here on ebay!!!!https://www.facebook.com/joseph.cabatit/videos/pcb.10212561739102037/10212561484295667/?type=3&theater Please read the condition description, these listing details, and examine the pictures carefully.
