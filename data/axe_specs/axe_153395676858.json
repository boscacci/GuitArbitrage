{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a 1992 Gibson EDS-1275 Doubleneck in a factory original Alpine White finish. This guitar has no cracks or repairs. The top, back and sides are very clean and glossy and have no funky odors. It has some faded around the edges from just average playing - but other than that, it's just a beautifully cared for and lightly aged 25 year old guitar. The finish on the top, back and neck is clean with very little playwear. Scroll down to see 55 more HD pictures. It has the OX4 PAF handwound pickups - almost $700 value on their own.
