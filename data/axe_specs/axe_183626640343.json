{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "-This guitar, for all intents and purposes is LIKE brand new!- Hello everyone! Today, you are in for a beautiful treat! If you are looking at this post, you already know what it is. It is the on the lighter side, chambered and most highly regarded 2008 Gibson Les Paul Standard PLUS in the most beautiful and rare Honeyburst finish. The top is beautiful!!! Even though it is chambered, it still weighs a little over 8lbs. As you can see, the top is gorgeous and the guitar is in MINT condition. The original frets show no wear all just like the rest of the guitar, but I\u2019ll let the pictures do the talking. Like mentioned before, the top is beautiful and the guitar has no buckle rash whatsoever. It comes with the OHSC that is great looking as well that came with the purchase. Everyone knows that these chambered models are killer guitars and very underrated. New, this guitar cost a fortune and from me now, you can get it for much, much cheaper. This guitar was purchased about 11 years ago, set up and then put away til now, without ever really having been played. It was cleaned very regularly and shows no tarnishing or any other type of wear that usually shows up from age; this thing is immaculate and was stored perfectly in a climate controlled space. The neck is the 60\u2019s slim neck that is not as slim as these new slim taper necks, but definitely slimmer than the 50\u2019s. The tone and sustain is simply ridiculous, but I\u2019ll let you be the judge. Unplugged, the strings ring out loudly and endlessly and well above average and this is the way I determine the quality of my Gibsons. If it sounds good unplugged, it\u2019s a keeper, and this one goes beyond that. Plugged in to my Amp (Marshall) it is a match made in heaven and the tone and sustain is second to none. It has been set up, the frets are polished and it is ready to rock. Honestly, here is that rare opportunity to purchase a beautiful, MINT condition Gibson Standard with a killer top at a really, really good price compared to what other people are selling these for when they do appear and in much, much worse condition. Don\u2019t let this one slip away as I know it will not last and I speak from experience. Due to the very attractive price and the immaculate condition of this guitar, as well as parts included in the sale, I know that I will be contacted a lot and with that said, I won\u2019t be able to hold the guitar for anyone; it\u2019ll be first come first serve. Furthermore, I reserve the right to end this sale at any time should my guitar sell locally or on other websites listed. I\u2019ve described this guitar to the best of my ability.
