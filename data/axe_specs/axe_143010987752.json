{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Original 1965 Fender Stratocaster-Original Sunburst FinishOriginal neck finish, headstock logo, & fretsHeel date: August 1965Neck plate serial number L776XXNeck pickup: 5.89K (original winding)Middle pickup: 6.01K (not original widing)Bridge pickup: 6.14K (not original winding)Original hard case included (original leather strap and 2 extra springs in the case are included too) This is NOT a Custom Shop or a reissue guitar, it is an original made in 1965 Fender Stratocaster. If you've been watching my ebay page lately, you've probably noticed that I've been selling off a lot of my collection. Not because I want to, but because I'm in a situation where I need to... This is an amazing old Stratocaster with amazing feel and tone and I hate to have to let it go, but here it is. It has a few issues that might not make this a serious collector's guitar, but it's without a doubt a player's dream! The finish, body, and neck are original down to the original headstock decal logo and the guitar has been played so it has ware. The bridge is original except the actual saddles (However, they are an authentic Fender USA \"PAT. PEND\" stamped reissue set). A previous owner in the mid 1970's decided to do some \"customizing\", routed under the bridge and middle pickups and also under the pickguard to install a switch (please see photos). They drilled a hole into the original pickguard so the pickguard is reissue, but the shielding plate is original. They swapped the original electronics with 1974 dated Stratocaster pots and a 5-way switch. The knobs, pickup covers, and pickups are the originals, but the bridge and middle pickups have been rewound. At one point the neck had a set of modern tuners installed, but the original Kluson tuners were included when I got the guitar so I put them back on. The case is original, but the Fender logo is missing from the lid. All three of the latches do open / close properly and the outer two latches still even \"spring\" open.Overall a very nice, mostly original \"L\" series Fender Stratocaster.
