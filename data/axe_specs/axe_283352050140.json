{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is my Jackson Soloist USA with reverse headstock. This guitar is extremely rare. I bought this used at guitar center. Made in 1991. The serial number is J5879. Please double check with Jackson.Cosmetically, the guitar has the usual dings and scratches expected from a guitar this old. It is in great condition though considering its age. The frets are in excellent condition. There are cracks in the binding (see picture 10 & 11). It's just in the binding. It does not affect the integrity and playability of the guitar. The integrity of this guitar is solid. It has ebony fretboard. I replaced some of the screws on the pickups so it will look nice. I'm getting a lot of questions whether the floydrose is floating, recessed or surface mount, so I added a picture (pls see last picture). The hardcase is really beat up but it still serves its purpose. Please review all pictures prior to buying. Message me for any questionI only ship to the lower 48 states. I don\u2019t ship international. I only accept Paypal. Item will be shipped within 48 hours (except weekend) of cleared payments. I have this guitar listed locally and in other websites. I reserve the right to cancel this listing at anytime in the event this guitar sells elsewhere first.", "ItemID": "283352050140", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T04:40:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-25T04:40:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/JACSKON-SOLOIST-USA-REVERSE-HEADSTOCK-/283352050140", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Covina, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833520501408080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTMzWDE2MDA=/z/ECQAAOSwmE5cSpCR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CuIAAOSwp3dcSpCS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gDAAAOSwGPNcSpCQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aiIAAOSwWN5cSpCQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzIw/z/zX8AAOSwgadcSpCQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n0sAAOSw5cZcSpCR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2GoAAOSwsZhcSpCQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/b0kAAOSwbZ5cSpCR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kQQAAOSwB0lcSpCR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjYw/z/QegAAOSw6jJcSpCQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjc4/z/28wAAOSwolpcSpCR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LCMAAOSwGIZcSpCR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "division21carlo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 430, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "8***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1080}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "JACSKON SOLOIST USA REVERSE HEADSTOCK", "HitCount": 65, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
