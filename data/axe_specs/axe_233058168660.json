Item Description After conquering South America with his fingers of fury, Brazilian Kiko Loureiro and his band Angra's first release went gold in Japan. Now as his musical reputation spreads through worldwide, Ibanez introduces the instrument on which Kiko and the guitar builder collaborated. The KIKOSP2 is Kiko's own take on Ibanez S Series-with thicker Poplar body for tighter low ends. Dressed in a transparent red finish of the Flamed Maple Art Grain top, the KIKOSP2 makes a visual statement as passionate as the player for whom it was designed. A Rosewood fretboard with jumbo frets provides a smooth, inviting playing surface and contributes to the KIKOSP2's well-defined tonality. Ibanez Infinity R pickups, along with 5-way switch selector provide an impressive palette of tone textures.
