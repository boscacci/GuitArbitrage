{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Almost new Black Fender Jimi Hendrix Stratocaster that has barely been used - with maybe 10 hours of playing time on it. This guitar sounds great and is in fantastic condition! If you are a Hendrix fan or just want a great guitar with a killer vintage sound, this guitar delivers. I bought this guitar at a silent auction fundraiser and haven't used it since - I don't have a need for it. Maple neck and black alder body - both with gloss finish, white pickguard with vintage white knobs, pickups and tremolo arm. American Vintage '65 pickups with the bridge pickup in reverse tilt position like Hendrix's flipped guitar. C-shaped neck with 9.5\" fretboard radius, 21 frets, reverse headstock for enhanced string tension. Plays great! Just to clarify - this is a RIGHT-HANDED guitar. Guitar comes with its original Fender gig bag. I just just changed the strings with Ernie Ball Super Slinkys so it's ready to go!!You may see some reflections in the finish of the guitar in the photos - these are not blemishes. Also, note that the protective plastic film is still on the back plate of the guitar (see photo).
