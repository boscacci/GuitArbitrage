{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a one-owner 2008 Gibson Les Paul Traditional in solid black. Weight relieved, non-chambered mahogany body with maple top and nitrocellulose lacquer finish. Mahogany neck with bound rosewood fretboard and trapezoid inlays. '50s neck profile. '57 Classic neck pickup and '57 Classic Plus bridge pickup with Alnico II magnets. TonePros Kluson locking tuners (these are direct bolt-on replacements and no modifications were made to the headstock). Original non-locking tuners included. Includes original Gibson USA hardshell case. This guitar has been played very little and there is virtually no visible fret wear. This guitar has stayed in my climate controlled smoke-free recording studio its entire life. There is some heavy checking in the top clear-coat finish on the front of the headstock around the high E string tuner and some light checking around the D and B string tuners (see photos). Checking is very common on guitars with a thin nitrocellulose finish, such as this one. The thin nitro finish contributes to the guitar's tone and sustain, and is a big part of what gives these guitars character as they age. An experienced luthier should be able to repair the finish if that's what you really want. If I was keeping the guitar I'd leave it as is and let the guitar continue to age naturally. Also, there are some light pick scratches in the top clear-coat near the volume controls, which is also very common on guitars with a nitro finish. US buyers only please. Local pickup in Grapevine Texas can be arranged. Payment must be received within 48 hours of auction end.", "ItemID": "302954893951", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T22:23:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T03:15:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2008-Gibson-Les-Paul-Traditional-Solid-Black-/302954893951", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Grapevine, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029548939518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dgkAAOSwRQFbumr4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LLoAAOSw0NRbumse/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Bb8AAOSwQjxbumsb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uBQAAOSwNjxbumsf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/77wAAOSwE-5bumsb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EB0AAOSwk35bumsb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6iwAAOSweTlbumsb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hXMAAOSwqOFbumsc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-twAAOSwSupbumsc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3nUAAOSwa6Zbumsd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ElQAAOSwpTJbumsd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "76051", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "andrew_ahmad", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 37, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 237}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2008 Gibson Les Paul Traditional Solid Black", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ebony"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2008"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Traditional"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 21, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
