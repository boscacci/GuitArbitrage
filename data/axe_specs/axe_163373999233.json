{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is a gorgeous Epiphone Les Paul Standard Honey Burst! The head-stock was broken in a shipping incident. The driver literally backed over it! OUCH! But our loss is your gain. The guitar only really needs the head-stock re-glued/replaced and it should be good to gig! The head-stock is obviously broken and the surface has a few minor dings, but still looks great! If anything, would still be great to raid for parts or make your own custom guitar. The pieces are included if you want to attempt a repair yourself. The guitar has a beautiful vintage \"honey burst\" look to it. Such a shame to see such a gorgeous Les Paul in this shape... The previous owner removed the pick-guard for a more vintage look. The original screws are still there if you ever want to reinstall it. Shipping is a flat $35 and I always ship SAME DAY so you get your stuff FAST!!! Hope you snag this awesome piece!", "ItemID": "163373999233", "EndTime": "2018-11-21T20:56:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T20:56:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Standard-Faded-Honey-Burst-Broken-Headstock-Parts-Repair-/163373999233", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hixson, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633739992338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/F74AAOSw-FRb7InG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/JbQAAOSw8cFb7InJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/oj4AAOSwV0Vb7InL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/b4QAAOSw1qhb7InN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAxWDEyMDA=/z/apUAAOSwQZVb7InP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/UpYAAOSwpFtb7InS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAxWDEyMDA=/z/0GgAAOSw18Jb7InU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAxWDEyMDA=/z/uXEAAOSwbetb7InW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAxWDEyMDA=/z/SZ4AAOSw8R9b7InY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/yrYAAOSwUPVb7Ina/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/aq0AAOSwQZVb7Inc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAxWDEyMDA=/z/A2YAAOSw96Zb7Inf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37343", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chattanoogatoybuyer*com", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3684, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 29, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 152.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 152.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 148}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul Standard Faded Honey Burst Broken Headstock for Parts/Repair", "HitCount": 693, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1170121447", "StoreName": "chattanoogatoybuyer"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 155.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Headstock was broken in transit to the store and has a few dings, but would make a nice restoration piece.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
