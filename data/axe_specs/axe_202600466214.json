{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a gorgeous black Ernie Ball Music Man Stingray solid body electric guitar, with ebony 22-fret fretboard, all in excellent clean condition. This guitar has very light wear from playing and handling in my home. I am the original owner and bought it new in 2017. The guitar was professionally set up, and its intonation has been maintained from time to time by my LGS. The guitar has never been dropped, banged, cracked or repaired in any way. It plays and sounds great. Comes with the original Music Man hard case, tremolo bar and case candy. Hard case has a few light scratches and minor handling marks on the outside. Inside is mint. This guitar has not been gigged or otherwise played out and has no buckle rash or noticeable dents or dings. I have played it a bit in my home and it has not been dropped or otherwise mishandled. I removed the plastic from the pickguard just before taking pics for this listing, so there are very few marks on the pickguard or the body from playing. This is a supersweet, easy-playing, solid sounding guitar that can suit a wide range of musical styles, but not everything of course. The guitar has been stored mostly in its case in a smoke-free, climate-controlled environment. The only reason I am selling it is that I am not using it, and it deserves a new owner who will make it sing and shine like it was meant to. Guitar will be packed securely its case and the case shipped with padding in heavy-duty cardboard box. Email me with any questions (I will respond in the evenings as I work full-time during the day) and good luck bidding!
