{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a near Mint condition, Limited run, 2014 Fender Classic 60s MIM custom shop designed Vegas Gold Stratocaster. Fender custom shop craftsman Greg Fessler had a hand in the design this guitar. It features custom shop 69 pickups and a two point tremolo and a special gold flake body. The guitar is in excellent condition and has not been played much. There are no scratches or damage, all I can find is minor pickguard marks from being played. Other than that it is as new. This particular model is starting to get a little rare these days as it is a Special Edition. The guitar sounds exceptional and I am certain that whoever purchases it will love it. I do not find any imperfections to speak of on it. There is a extra spring on the tremolo to keep it down closer to the body and it is set up pretty nice but of course everybody is different as to the way they like their guitars set up. The guitar comes in a non Fender gig bag and trem arm. I am open to any questions you may have about this guitar so feel free to ask. I am sorry but at this time I do not sell or ship anywhere outside of the United States.Body TypeSolidbodyBody ShapeStratocasterLeft-/Right-handedRight-handedNumber of Strings6Body MaterialAlderBody FinishPolyesterColorVegas GoldNeck MaterialMaple, Bolt-onNeck ShapeCFingerboard MaterialRosewood, 12\" RadiusFingerboard InlayWhite DotsNumber of Frets21Scale Length25.5\"Nut Width1.650\"Nut MaterialSynthetic BoneBridge/TailpieceVintage Style 2-Point Synchronized Tremolo with Stamped Steel SaddlesTunersVintage StyleNumber of Pickups3Neck PickupCustom '69 Single-coilMiddle PickupCustom '69 Single-coilBridge PickupCustom '69 Single-coilControls1 x Volume, 2 x Tone, 5-way switchStringsFender Super 250R, (.010-.046)Case IncludedGig BagManufacturer Part Number0140163318", "ItemID": "113499101500", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T17:35:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-28T20:04:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2014-Fender-Classic-60s-custom-shop-designed-Vegas-Gold-Sparkle-Stratocaster-FSR-/113499101500", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Huntersville, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134991015008080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/0dQAAOSw5YlcKAJm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/c1IAAOSwGq5cJn7E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/3dMAAOSwtQNcJn7w/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/14IAAOSw5EpcKAJp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/6xgAAOSwSVNcKAJt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/1gUAAOSwkAxcKAJv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/35YAAOSwIr5cKAJz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/o5MAAOSwcnZcKAJ3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/RCQAAOSwEVlcKAJ6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/L4oAAOSwcOZcKAJ9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/i2sAAOSwcapcKAKA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/NUEAAOSw27lcKAKE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "28078", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pbales", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1386, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 825.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 825.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 988}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2014 Fender Classic 60s custom shop designed Vegas Gold Sparkle Stratocaster FSR", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Classic Player"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold Sparkle"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2014"]}]}, "HitCount": 189, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent, no signs of wear.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
