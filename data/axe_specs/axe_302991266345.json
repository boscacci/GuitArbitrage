{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Thanks for checking out this collectable old Univox, inspired by Mosrite, but cool on its own.\u00a0 This example has all original parts, including the awesome Univox Humbuckers, which sounds great and are collectable by themselves. The pickups are hard to describe, but I would say they are \u201cchimey\u201d in other words clearer than standard buckers. They have a crisp top end which cuts through and makes it nice to play with various positions and tone settings.\u00a0 The guitar has been well used and has taken some knocks as seen by the multiple dings around the scalloped edges, hairline body cracks on either side of the neck joint and slight separation of fretboard on the treble side from the 2nd to the 8th frets, shown. These issues are stable however and the guitar plays fine and has good action. There is the slightest amount of string buzz on the high E string in open position which should be solveable with some kind of nut adjustment. Picture also shows the D-ring on back of headstock used to hang the guitar from a hook! You don\u2019t have to use this obviously, but I didn\u2019t see reason to remove it.\u00a0 Lastly I want to comment on the added electronics which are a phase switch, and a switch that is designed to alternate tone caps. The phase switch is functional and give a nice addition to the tonal palette, but it does make the neck pickup \u201clive\u201d, eg the metal surround becomes hot and will hum if you touch it. This is not an issue for me based on hand position, but FYI. The tone cap switch has 3 positions, but I can\u2019t tell if they are different, but tone knob does work. It\u2019s a cool idea for someone who wants to experiment with tone Lindy Fralin style.\u00a0 Includes near-new carry bag.\u00a0 Bottom line, due to some issues with this guitar, you have a chance to get in to a Univox on the cheaper side! Fun guitar for a tweaker who is ready to give some TLC to this cool piece. After cleaning it up I thought twice about letting it go, but it deserves a better home and more attention than I will give! \u00a0", "ItemID": "302991266345", "EndTime": "2018-12-15T17:26:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T17:26:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Univox-Hi-flier-Mosrite-Inspired-Black-/302991266345", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Swarthmore, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029912663458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTE=/z/gA0AAOSwDX5cDpgq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t4IAAOSwPVFcDpgu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zYUAAOSwMpFcDpgz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g-UAAOSw-QBcDpg1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x0gAAOSwPAJcDpg2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JjkAAOSwk4RcDpg4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YYQAAOSwrAFcDpg6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rZoAAOSwVldcDpg7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/T-4AAOSw~atcDpg8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KJEAAOSw8MxcDpg-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TfwAAOSwBMpcDpg~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VvwAAOSwmT1cDphB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "19081", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jwr10276", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 223, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Univox Hi-flier Mosrite Inspired, Black", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Univox"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 276, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 385.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
