The shorter 24.5\" scale length of the 245 makes bending easier and gives your strings a slinkier feel.

The PRS SE 245 is fitted with their wide-fat neck profile. Perfected after years of prototyping, the wide-fat neck is based on designs Paul Reed Smith did in the '70s and '80s for Carlos Santana, Peter Frampton, and Howard Leese of Heart. The SE 245's rosewood fingerboard is smooth and warm sounding, and the iconic bird inlays are the calling card of this top-notch guitar maker.The PRS SE 245 is fitted with two PRS-designed SE 245 humbucking pickups. Based around great vintage humbuckers, these pickups are clear and punchy. Guitarists immediately noticed the ability of these pickups to conjure mellow chords one minute and punch the front of an amplifier for high-gain tones while maintaining attack and clarity the next. And the mahogany body ensures these pickups deliver the full low-mid tone that fattens all of your single-note playing for singing sustain.The SE 245, like all PRS guitars, is designed for top-notch performance right out of the case. Since 2001, the SE Series has provided excellent tone and play-ability at an incredibly affordable price point.
