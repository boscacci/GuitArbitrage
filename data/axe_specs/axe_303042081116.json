{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "CAREFULLY READ ITEM DESCRIPTION AND THE TERMS OF SALE. Thanks\u2014 ITEM DESCRIPTION: When getting one's audio ready for final mix and mastering, hitting the mastering unit with control and with heat is imperative. The Waves L2 is the unit know for precisely this kind of \"brick-wall\" limiting. This unit is in proper working conditions, ships with power cord, and shows light signs of previous racking and use. There is a reason why the hardware version of the L2 is still in high demand: when it comes to making one's material master-ready, short of dropping a mini-fortune at a mastering house, these units provide the best all-in-one compression processing for the job. And in my humble opinion, there is really no substitute for a hardware-based method of dialing in the necessary tweaks required for an audio work's final processing.Unit will be boxed up tight to insure safe transit during shipping.
