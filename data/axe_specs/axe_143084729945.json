{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "PLEASE NOTE: UNABLE TO SHIP BETWEEN DEC. 22-28 DUE TO HOLIDAYS.This Buy it Now listing is for a rare Edwards by ESP Vision Beta guitar. Among the earliest Edwards guitars, this was made in Japan by the ESP Custom Shop and is similar to some ESP models. Bruce Kulick and Paul Pesco were endorsers of this model. Very rare in that it has a body with a mahogany core and thick maple top and back (see pics of body). The comfy maple neck is topped with a combined maple/rosewood fingerboard. The trem is an ESP-branded Floyd Rose type trem. The pickups are ESP- the middle has been replaced with a Duncan but the original is included. Plays like butter with low action and great tone. A nice ESP gig bag is included. You won't find another guitar that is nearly as nice for the price. Please note: This listing is for the continental USA (lower 48) only. All sales are final/as-is, so please ask questions in advance to make sure this is the right guitar for you.", "ItemID": "143084729945", "EndTime": "2019-01-15T09:20:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-09T00:35:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Edwards-ESP-Vision-Beta-electric-guitar-MIJ-/143084729945", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430847299458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iCkAAOSwdzhb-zp5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CzkAAOSwH2Vb-zpe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BdwAAOSwt3hb-zpu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vIcAAOSwPmVb-zo~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LmwAAOSwoZlb-zpR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUyWDYwMA==/z/AxEAAOSwEphcGBME/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUyWDYwMA==/z/AOcAAOSwrZBcGBMG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "73112", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "virtualbassist", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 421, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 352}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Edwards by ESP Vision Beta electric guitar MIJ", "HitCount": 71, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very clean condition, a couple of light dings and some wear on the back trem cover.
