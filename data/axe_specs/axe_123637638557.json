Issued rather small circulation.Very good condition of guitar. Only little scratches, and one horn chip on the guitar body, you can see it on last photo. Guitar neck is straight.Tone and volume potenciometers sounds good, not rustling, because I lubricated it periodically.Rockfield humbuckers sounds really good. At one time I used a set of EMG 81-85 pickups, but then I went back to Rockfield, because I liked their sound much more.I used Floyd Rose only for the first 2-3 years, then I realized that I didn't need him, and blocked it. Now, before selling it, I unlocked and tuned it again. varnish glitters almost like new.
