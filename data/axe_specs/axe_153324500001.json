{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a 2011 Fender Empress limited edition USA Telecaster in near mint condition and in perfect working order, complete with the original hangtags, case candy, and hardshell case. Part of Fender's very limited run of Telebration guitars offered to celebrate Fender's 60th anniversary of their original electric guitar model, this Empress Telecaster has a body constructed of lightweight Empress wood, resulting in a guitar that weighs a mere 6lbs. The \"Hot Tele\" alnico 3 magnet single coils deliver plenty of snap and snarl, with cutting, chiming tone from the bridge pickup and more girth and warmth when switched to the neck position single coil. Professionally setup here at Mike & Mike's Guitar Bar and dialed in with 10-46 strings, this Tele plays effortlessly, sound great, and is virtually unplayed since new. The 22 fret maple neck has a medium C shaped profile with slight shoulders and a smooth satin finish. The medium jumbo frets are flawless on the 25 1/2\" scale, the fretboard radius is 9 1/2\", and the nut measures 1 5/8\" in width. The headstock retains the original Schaller-made chrome tuning machines, and while the guitar has a \"US12\" prefix serial number (indicating 2012), this model was actually released in 2011. On the body, the gloss Sienna Sunburst finish is accented by a single-ply white guard, and the chrome hardware is flawless. The electronics include Fender's Greasebucket tone circuit, which smoothly rolls off highs without adding bass. Cosmetically, this guitar is near mint, with only a few faint scuffs in the pick path and a tiny finish nick on the bass side lower bout edge of the slab body. The original hardshell case, hangtags, and case candy is included.
