{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Upgrades:- Fender Pure Vintage '59 Strat Pickup Set - $100- Road Runner RR1EG Avenue Series Electric Guitar Gig Bag - $45Description:Bought this one a month ago on the whim browsing GC just trying out stuff. this one was one of the best Mexican made strats i have ever played. Couldn't put her down so just brought home with me. As always, i just end up playing my American made guitars and this ended up sitting in the gig bag (included). After i brought this one home i dropped in, what i consider the best pickups Fender makes, Fender Pure Vintage 59 stratocaster pickups and this guitar just went to a whole new level. It just sings like a strat should, very responsive. You want true SRV tone ... this is it! These pickups and guitar nails it. Neck is super comfy especially for smaller hands ... the american strats have slightly wider neck so its harder to do thumb wraparound. Super easy to do on this one, and just in general manhandle the neck for extra tone squeezing. Sateen neck finish on the back makes this neck very fast and smooth. Frets are like new, very well leveled and gets low action easily. This one is setup with 10s, completely straight neck with very low action just where there is slight acoustic buzz but no amplified buzz when fretting, just the way i like it on strats. You'll be shredding right out of the gigbag. Great for beginners as its already setup and ready to play, just plug it in. Guitar comes with just gig bag and trem arm. No documentation or hex keys. I can probably find an extra set of hex keys if you really need them.", "ItemID": "153326610747", "EndTime": "2019-01-04T03:03:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T03:53:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-Fender-Limited-Edition-Standard-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar-Sea-Foam-Pearl-/153326610747", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Brooklyn, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533266107478080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VNsAAOSwpLVcLYZ1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QwYAAOSwQXlcLYZ0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iBIAAOSwiwZcLYZ2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JmEAAOSwgnJcLYZ6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vE0AAOSw0wJcLYZ4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2zoAAOSwZwdcLYZ4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lvQAAOSwhr9cLYZz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JB8AAOSwydZcLYZ2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pfcAAOSwa~FcLYZ4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IqwAAOSwkHxcLYZ4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZEUAAOSwwkRcLYZ2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OVg4OTk=/z/TF8AAOSwhzhcLYZy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "11215", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stanliv2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 551, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***3", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 113}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "PH", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2018 Fender Limited Edition Standard Stratocaster Electric Guitar\u00a0Sea Foam Pearl", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 150, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
