These special humbuckers were engineered to give your G5622T a pre-EQ'd tone, with lots of high-end sparkle and low-end punch to fill out your sound. Add to that a flexible pickup switching circuit that lets you quickly jump between your favorite configurations, and you're in for a world of tone.Long spruce center block enhances your sound You get a lot of tonal bang for your buck with the Gretsch G5622T, thanks to its long spruce center block. Running the full length of the body, the center block allows the otherwise hollow body to resist resonant-frequency feedback. That means you can rock out louder with more gain, without your amplifier squealing out of control. Spruce is a snappy tonewood too, and since the center block connects with the bridge, the note definition and clarity of the G5622T are amazing.Smooth vibrato action, courtesy of a real Bigsby tailpiece Nothing beats the character and vintage vibe that a real Bigsby tailpiece adds.
