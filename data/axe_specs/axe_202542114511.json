{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "FENDER QUALITY AT A GREAT PRICE! PROFESSIONALLY SERVICED and READY TO PLAY!! This is a Squier by Fender Affinity Series Telecaster Electric Guitar. The guitar is 100% complete, and GREAT PLAYER. There are a few light marks that include scuffs and scratches. Two dings on the back of the body. It has a custom tortoise pickguard. It is in perfect structural condition. It comes with the gig bag case you see in the pictures. Features include: Chrome hardware, sealed tuners, 21 fret maple neck w/ dot markers, two single coil pickups, 3 way pickup switch, master volume control, master tone control, four ply pick guard, natural finished body. The set up on this guitar is awesome, nice and low. The truss rod works as it should, neck is straight. All the electronics work as they should (no scratchy pots). Frets and finger board look new. I have completely serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the body and neck, cleaned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the frets, tweaked the neck truss rod, adjusted the bridge and intonation, etc. I spend as much time and what ever it takes to make guitars play and perform as good as they possibly can. I can honestly say this guitar plays better than most new ones. DON'T MISS IT!! Buyer pays $29.95 shipping, insurance, PACKAGING and HANDLING to the contiguous 48 states. Items over 2 lbs will ship Fed Ex ground, (no PO Boxes). Please take a look at the last picture and my other listings.
