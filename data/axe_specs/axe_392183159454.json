A brand New guitar that was just on display for 4-days and than sent to Top 40 Guitars! This is really cool. You are looking at a 2017 Supro Hampton Electric Guitar. All the Vintage Vibe in a modern Guitar! With three mini-humbucker-size Gold Foil pickups and a five-position blade pickup selector switch, the Hampton will give you many tonal variations. Think of it as the Fattest Strat you've ever heard. From The Web: The Hampton is a 21st-century update of the Supro electric solid-body guitar. The elegant comfort of the 1960\u2019s-era beveled-edge Ozark body shape and the mighty sound of the original field-coil pickups have been enhanced with an ultra-fast satin neck, Tune-o-matic bridge and updated wave tailpiece. The result is a modern player\u2019s instrument with old-school style and authentic Supro tone. The unique Gold Foil pickups found in the Supro Hampton are faithful reproductions of the original magnetics developed for Valco by Ralph Keller in the early 1950s. These pickups, which gave voice to the vintage Chicago-made Supro guitars, have a massive, broadband sound with remarkably low noise for a single-coil design. The mini-humbucker-sized version of the Supro Gold Foil pickup found in this guitar have the same internal construction as the humbucker-sized versions found in the other Island Series models. The Hampton\u2019s bridge pickup is wound slightly hotter than the others, while the middle pickup is RWRP, providing fully hum-cancelling sound in the \u201c2 and 4\u201d positions of the 5-way blade switch. The time-tested tone wood recipe of an alder body paired with a 25.5 in.-scale maple neck and rosewood fretboard combine with the Hampton\u2019s vintage-correct pickups to produce an exceptionally dynamic playing experience. Blending vintage American tone with refined set-neck design, the Supro Hampton is intended for the professional musician who needs an ergonomic and versatile guitar capable of handling most genres of music with authority. The three pickups cover a huge range of tones, from fat single-coil jazz tones in the neck position to spanky funk tones and sparkling twang in the middle, and pure rock power when the bridge pickup is selected. The Hampton guitar and its relatives in the Island Series represent the rebirth of the Supro brand as a stringed instrument manufacturer. The Supro Island series of guitars was designed by David Koltai and Glenn Sweetwood, with technical assistance from master designer Trevor Wilkinson and vintage pickup expert Ken Calvet.
