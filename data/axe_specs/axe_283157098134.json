{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage 1981 Greco EG-800 CTM EB Les Paul Custom with Gibson USA case. Classic Fujigen Gakki high quality, hand crafted \"lawsuit\" era guitar made in Japan. These were non-export premium grade replica guitars, which could only be purchased new in Japan. A much more accurate and superior reproduction compared to the non-standard, bolt-on neck LP copies that Ibanez and numerous others were importing to the US back in the day. Many features of this rare guitar are spot-on to a late 1960's to early 1970's Gibson era \"Black Beauty\" LP Custom; a nice, straight set chunky \"C\" shape long tenon mahogany neck with fret edge binding, correctly proportioned open-book headstock with mother of pearl split diamond inlay, 1 11/16\" wide nut, Norlin style tilt and volute, waffleback tuners, rosewood fingerboard with large block inlays, solid mahogany body, carved maple top, high-gloss finish, multi-layer binding, ABR-1 style bridge, stop tailpiece, witch-hat knobs, etc. Weighs approx. 10lbs 4oz. This particular EG-800 is in exceptional condition for a 37+ year old instrument. I acquired this guitar as a collectable, so it has seen virtually zero play time since I purchased it from the original owner in Japan back in 2004. No breaks or repairs. It has been well cared for and is all original minus pickup covers, and the factory model sticker (seen in photos 2 & 7) has been removed. It shows minimal wear, however there are some superficial scuffs & dings here and there that one would reasonably expect of a guitar this age. There is some minor clear coat checking in the neck heel area (see photo #9). The original plastic input jack plate and bridge pickup ring have acquired tiny, age-related stress cracks over the years (see photos 6 & 11). Of course, none of these superficial imperfections affect functionality or playability, and are quite normal for a decades old vintage guitar. The original medium frets still have most of their life left in them. High quality hardware and electronics were used throughout. The gold hardware is still nice and shiny! The guitar plays beautifully. Action is nice and low, approx. .046 (low E) and .038 (high E) at the twelfth fret. The Greco vintage PAF style pickups measure 7.18k (bridge) and 7.22k (neck) on my ohm meter and they sound phenomenal! Definitely has the mojo and would fare extremely well in a taste test against any Norlin era Les Paul Custom. Comes complete with a Gibson USA black reptile case with white plush interior. Case is in excellent condition, but as with many TKL cases, the lock button can be a bit fidgety. It is understandable why the top US musical instrument manufacturers were jumpy about these repros. If you've been looking for a \"closet classic\" vintage Les Paul Custom, but don't want to break the bank, the search is over! Please review all photos and ask any questions you may have prior to buying. Item will be carefully packaged and shipped fully insured. Comes to you from a smoke-free, pet free, humidity controlled environment.
