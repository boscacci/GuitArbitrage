{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Beautiful Guitar for sale. I would list this as mint, but I would only do that if this guitar was brand new. Regardless, this Guitar sounds amazing and the neck is fantastic. That and the African Mahogany makes this an amazing guitar. I just do not play this one enough. Simply put, Suhr guitars are fantastic.I will consider all serious offers.From the Suhr Website about this guitar:The release of the Modern T Satin in 2016 marked the debut of an entirely new model for Suhr. Designed in conjunction with Andy Wood, the Modern T combines the 24 fret neck and sculpted heel joint of our Modern with the body shape of our Classic T, improving player comfort at the upper frets while preserving a more traditional design aesthetic. The Modern T Satin utilizes African Mahogany for both the body and the neck, resulting in an extremely responsive instrument that reacts to the subtlest dynamics. Equipped with Suhr SSH+ and SSV pickups and a 5-way selector switch, the Modern T Satin offers guitarists a wide array of humbucking and single coil tones; from high gain shred to glassy cleans. The Modern T Satin is a high performance workhorse with classic roots.", "ItemID": "264090145638", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T11:15:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-16T05:52:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Suhr-Modern-T-Satin-HH-w-African-Mahoganny-2016-Limited-Run-/264090145638", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Gulf Breeze, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640901456388080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQxWDEwMjg=/z/Ix8AAOSwFx5cFebD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcy/z/sZoAAOSwqRlcFebF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzM1WDExMjU=/z/Ih0AAOSwvERcFebB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4M1gxMTI1/z/cIwAAOSwWI5cFebE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzM1WDcxMg==/z/13sAAOSwI01cFebB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MTY=/z/04YAAOSwMOtcFebD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mzg=/z/u0MAAOSwa1hcFebC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzI4WDExMjU=/z/nkgAAOSwPWtcFebE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzI4WDExMjU=/z/EJgAAOSwQXlcFebC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzMxWDExMjU=/z/dJwAAOSw0~pcFebC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32561", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "perinold", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 151, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1640.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1640.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 201}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Suhr Modern T Satin HH w/ African Mahoganny -2016 Limited Run\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Suhr"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 18, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
