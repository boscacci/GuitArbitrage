Description from the Fender Website:SLOWHAND SOUND AND STYLEExperience the peerless Strat\u00ae style of Slowhand himself with the Eric Clapton Stratocaster, one of our most acclaimed and enduring artist signature models. With classic design and special features that give it exceptional tonal versatility and effortless feel worthy of one of the world's greatest names in rock and blues, it puts pure Clapton Stratocaster tone and feel straight into your hands. FEATURE Alder bodyBody Color - PEWTERVintage Noiseless\u2122 pickupsActive mid-boost and TBX tone circuits Special \u201csoft V\u201d neck profile Vintage-style blocked synchronized tremolo bridgeSPECS\u00b7 \"SOFT V\" NECK PROFILEThe \"soft V\"neck profile (the shape of the neck in cross section) on the Eric Clapton Stratocaster has a distinctly comfortable fretting-hand feel that takes the more pronounced sharpness of a \u201950s \"V\" profile and\"softens\" it into a somewhat more rounded shape. Ideal for players with larger hands whose thumb extends over the edge of the fingerboard.TBX TONE CONTROLThe first tone control knob operates this guitar\u2019s TBX (Treble Bass Expander) tone circuitry. The knob has a detent at the center position (5) and works like a normal tone control from zero to the detent. Turning the knob clockwise from the detent adds presence and brightness; turning it counterclockwise from the detent rolls off high frequencies.ACTIVE MID BOOSTThe second tone control knob functions as an active mid-boost control. Turning it clockwise boosts mid and bass frequencies while decreasing treble frequencies.BLOCKED TREMOLOThe Eric Clapton Stratocaster comes with an easily removable wood block installed between the tremolo block and tremolo cavity wall to keep it from moving, as specified by the great guitarist himself.URETHANE FINISHUrethane guitar body finishes are especially strong and durable, and will hold colors with great vividness, sheen and clarity for extraordinarily long periods.9.5\"FINGERBOARD RADIUSThe fingerboard radius is an important spec that describes the amount of curvature across the width of the fingerboard. This instrument\u2019s modern 9.5\" fingerboard radius is slightly more flattened than a vintage-style radius, but still with enough arcto provide a natural and notably comfortable fretting-hand feel, and to make bending notes easier.
