The American Original '50s ash body and Soft \"V\" maple neck are staples of this era, as are its vintage-tall frets, synchronized trem system, and nitro lacquer finish. Yet an enlarged 9.5\" fingerboard radius (from 7.25\") gives the American Original '50s Strat an advantage for lead work. Meanwhile, a trio of painstaking Pure Vintage '59 pickups with period-correct wire, bobbins, and pole pieces \u2014 wax potted for feedback control and wired for 5-way switching \u2014 puts this instrument in a class all its own.
