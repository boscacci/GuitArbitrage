Shipping to the lower 48 states only.I will not ship anywhere else.Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool SX Standard Series Short Scale 3/4 size guitar. Great size for students,petite ladies or geezers like me whose backs hurt all the time. I did a quick set up to get some nice action going on. All the electronics work perfectly and guitar sounds great. The guitar has been wired for tone control on all three pickups.The bridge and neck pickups both work with the neck pickups tone control. Nice to have tone control on the bridge pickup,makes it a lot more versatile. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. 21 fret neck shows zero fret wear and feels great. The body looks great, just mild surface scratches. I was surprised by how good it sounds and how well it plays. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. Here's some hype from SX: Short Scale Guitar: A great guitar package for your young beginner! This scaled down, 3/4 size guitar is about 3\" shorter and 2\" more narrow than a full size guitar. It is excellent for a person who is between 4'2\" and 4'10\", or for a larger person who just wants a smaller instrument (for perhaps when one travels). People with back issues also enjoy this light weight guitar. Solid basswood body! (The solid basswood provides superior sound. Many guitars in this price range that are sold by other vendors often contain plywood.) Dual cutaway allows access to the highest frets. Die cast chrome tuners. The body is contoured for hours of comfortable play. Three powerful single coil pickups, one volume control, two tone controls, plus a five position pickup selector switch let you create an incredible range of sounds. Vintage fulcrum bridge with six adjustable saddles. (The fulcrum bridge has a tremolo bar, which allows you to make some awesome sound effects. The 6 adjustable saddles adjust string height, radius, and intonation.) Truss rod adjustable maple neck! (A truss rod is an adjustable neck reinforcement designed to resist the forward bending force of the high tension of steel strings, and is found in the finest of electric guitars.) Rosewood fretboard, 21 jumbo frets. IF YOU LEFT CLICK YOUR MOUSE ON ANY OF THE PICTURES THEY WILL ENLARGE FOR A BETTER VIEW. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented. Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody,instead of working. Most deliveries will require adult signature.
