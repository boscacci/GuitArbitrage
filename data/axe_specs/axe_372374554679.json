{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This original 1985 G & L ASAT is from the early days of G&L and it plays and sounds incredible. It's been loved and played all these years and sounds as great as it looks. The vintage white finish is stunning and super nicely aged. The neck has lots of wear and feels amazing. Tone of the original pickups is classic vintage Tele like tone, but a little more unique. Very warm tones. A killer old G & L with a great vibe and look. All original with the exception of the string tree. Comes with a good hard case. Guitar is exactly as pictured. Buyer pays $65 shipping in the USA, $150 to Hawaii or Alaska, $250 International.
