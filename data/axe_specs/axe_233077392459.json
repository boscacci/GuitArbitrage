{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Carvin \"Fatboy\" Allan Holdsworth signature guitar. I believe this guitar is from 2012, but i am not 100% sure on that. It has two M22 pickups, Volume knob, 2 coil split switches, 1 20db boost switch, 3 way pickup selector, maple fret board with MOP triangle inlays. Maple neck and ash body. Guitar has perfect intonation and string action. Set up with 11 gauge strings. Comes with original hard shell case (tweed style, manufactured by G&G). Has Carvin locking tuners. This is a very nice guitar and has a wide range of tones it can accomplish. It is a partial hollow body and the M22 pickups are not wax potted. Therefore, it has an airy quality to it. It has a great strumming sound for accompaniment. It produces outstanding jazz tones, mellow but articulate. The real surprise with the sound for me was how good it sounded with a bluesy, slightly overdriven sound. Fantastic overtones and harmonics. The neck is beefy but super comfortable and the fret board is slick but not slippery. Easy to finger pick. The boost switch is amazing. it does not make a crazy overdriven sound, but allows for more easy clipping and a more easily obtainable overdrive on a low volume amp. The coil splits do their job well, but i usually just left them in their hum bucker positions. The build quality is second to none. in many ways, i find it to be better than Gibson and every bit as good as PRS. The reason i am selling it is because it does have one achilles heel:........... no tone knob on the guitar. I thought i would be ok with this, but i wasn't. Some folks always leave their tone pegged on 10 (on the guitar) and use their amp to change tone. This is a style thing and I understand why people do it, as they like for the guitar to provide 100% of its sound to the amp, and then color the sound from the amp forward. I was never that way and gave this guitar a go as a gentle foray into the world of being an amp knob tone tweeter. I became frustrated always going to the amp to change tone. I thought about installing a tone knob, but decided against it. and thats whyI am selling it. Sale open to the contiguous United States only. Shipping is 60$. Please feel free to ask any questions.
