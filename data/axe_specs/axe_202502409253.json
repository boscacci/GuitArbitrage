{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "100% of the proceeded's will go to a GoFundMe fundraiser for a mother that lost her home, car, purse, everything but the clothes she was wearing. The fundraiser is called \"Lost Everything in a Fire\", from Cleveland OH, with a photo of her on the posting . A direct link here may get flagged so you can search for it on their site to view the posting.Once payment is made, that amount will be transferred over to GoFundMe and a receipt will be given to the buyer showing the funds were sent. This will be 100% of the funds, I am paying the listing fees, selling fees and shipping all out of pocket.Now about the guitar: 1998 Serial #4698. This is 1 of 2 \"twin\" guitars I have. Meaning they are from the same piece of wood for the top.This has been passed on from collector to collector and has been gently played at home. If you are going to gig with this, you will need to give it a set up to do so. I do keep all my guitars in a well ventilated / temperature area. There are slight marks (minor scratches and divots) on the back if you look for them but considering this is almost 20 years old, I would call the condition very good. Please contact me if you need more photos.Sustainer works no issues and will check again before shipping. No international shipping. The guitar will be sent out the week after Thanksgiving.", "ItemID": "202502409253", "EndTime": "2018-11-24T17:36:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T17:36:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/100-CHARITY-1998-KOA-Body-PC1-Natural-Early-Jackson-Phil-Collen-Def-Leppard-/202502409253", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Newton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025024092538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/xqQAAOSwIFtaHCGS/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTU3WDc1MA==/z/1KcAAOSwbrRbZteK/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/FMUAAOSwYwJaHCGa/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/tQ8AAOSwySVaHCGJ/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/BFkAAOSwridaHCG1/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/g1oAAOSwYxBaHCGt/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/-2wAAOSwc~laHCG9/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/y0UAAOSwZtlaHCHe/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/BasAAOSwmudaHCHH/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/okwAAOSwsBtaHCHm/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/ymYAAOSwZtlaHCGk/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/fzoAAOSwovNaHCHP/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "07860", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rocknized", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2538, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 33, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 100}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "100% CHARITY 1998 KOA Body PC1 Natural Early Jackson Phil Collen Def Leppard", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Koa"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1998"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["PC1"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Au Natural"]}]}, "HitCount": 1062, "Subtitle": "100% PROCEEDS To A Mother That Lost Her OH Home In Fire", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "33003", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Entertainment Memorabilia:Music Memorabilia:Rock & Pop:Artists D:Def Leppard", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "45100:2329:108765:104714:33003", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good condition, only played at home, a collectors guitar", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
