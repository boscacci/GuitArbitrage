The Story:\"Sold from 1969 - 1971, Ovation Eclipse is part of the Tornado series, during that time the body was made in Germany by Hofner Guitars, Ovation company in Conn recieved a shippment of Storm body's, the paint job did not meet expectations, so Ovation decided to re-paint them, Ovation in Conn did not have any paint other than the \"bowl paint\" used on the back of thier Acoustic guitars, so they painted these 100 or so body's with this very durable paint, they also up-graded the pick-up's and named these 100 or so the Eclipse.
