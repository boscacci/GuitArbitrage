{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a Fender Telecaster with a Bigsby B5 w/Vibramate mounting (no holes) Made in Mexico in 1996Serial number MN6149366 This Telecaster has a sweet lush sounding lipstick neck pickup, Seymour Duncan Humbucker in the bridge position, 3-way switch tone and volume. An interesting and diverse pickup combination. Playing this guitar inspires. I love it when that happens. Comfortable 9.5 neck radius, 4-bolt straight neck Frets show some wear but no buzzing - very clean fast action. There are blemishes etc, some nicks in the paint and a paint chip on the butt below the jack (see pix). There is nothing of any player's consequence - just 22 years of genuine character. I wouldn't fix anything - it likes being who it is. If purchased separately, the upgrades are $435 uninstalled... Bigsby B5 is $240, Vibramate $120 - Seymour Duncan JB SH-4 is $75. The Bigsby B5 vibrato is absolutely wonderful - smooth action distinguishable sound. The effect is so satisfying and recognizable. Stays in tune beautifully. Vibramate uses existing bridge saddles. No drill, no holes. Bigsby has plenty of adjustment options but currently set up perfectly (opinion of course). Comes with Fender gig bag in good shape. I appreciate that once we buy a guitar, we can't wait to get it. I'll package it well for its journey to you and I'll ship it immediately. Shipping to USA 48 States for flat $45.
