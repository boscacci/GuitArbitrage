{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a great looking,playing and sounding guitar!!! It is the Ibanez RGIR30BE-BKF guitar. It is in very nice shape, there is one small ding on the lower back edge,but other than that this baby is clean!! The trem arm is included. The guitar has EMG's and they sound awesome. The neck is bound and has a great feel to it, not the super skinny early wizard profile. This guitar was used for a recording session in my home studio. The plastic cover is still on the trem cover. These are great RG models. The case is a heavy duty Jackson,not a perfect fit but it will protect the guitar quite well, it's in great shape also. Good Bidding!!!
