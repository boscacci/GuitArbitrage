Please if you any questions, ask them before the close of the auction. So bid with confidence. All auctions must be paid for within 10 days. I have had a lot of no shows with the money lately, so I will be sending a second email after five days then a Non-Paying Bidder Alert after the 10 days. I don't like to be so strict but it costs me time and money to place the items on Ebay and would like to ship as soon as possible. It's also nice to have the money in the bank so I can go and buy more neat stuff to sell. PLEASE Note shipping charges are calculated USPS rates, my normal $2.00 handling fee plus now all items are shipped with insurance included at no charge. But \"If it fits It ships\" any item that we can fit into a flat rate box (if the total is cheaper) we will ship that way. Any overpayment will be refunded the day of shipping. \u00a0 NOTICE I am No Longer Shipping Outside of The USA unless buyer using eBay Global-Too many problems (payment/delivery). And the last thing, if the listing above does not say that an item has a box, paperwork or extra pieces, don't expect it. Normally it's what you see is what you get unless stated in the listing. Thanks again, Chris. I do not send 2nd chance requests nor ask for payment via any wire service-Please use either Pay Pal or call me for credit card use-Again Never send money via wire service(just had a winner get scammed) Pictures sell!
