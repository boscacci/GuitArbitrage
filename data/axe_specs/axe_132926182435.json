{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Danelectro Mod 7 String Rare Model Electric Guitar Black Sparkle W/ Road Case Rare Danelectro Mod 7 in very good condition. Rosewood fretboard and frets are in excellent shape. The Danelectro band around the guitar is in good shape. A few scratches on the backside, and minor scuffing on the edges (pictured). I'm not sure exactly the year this one was made, but Danelectro produced the Mod 7 from 1999 to 2001. Made in Korea.Comes with a padded Road Runner gig bag.Here's some info and specs.*The Mod combines the best of both worlds... The drive and power of a humbucker with the sweetness and richness of two Lipsticks. Exclusive Select-O-Matic switching plus coil tap switch provides eleven distinct tone variations. Gotoh tuners and adjustable bridge. Like owning eleven monster guitars in one! The Select-O-Matic pickup selector has six positions: 1-Neck/Bridge, 2-Neck, 3-Neck/Middle, 4-middle, 5-Middle/Bridge, 6-Bridge The Blow Switch: Bypasses the rotary switch and turns all 3 pickups on at once in series which gives the DC-3 a 7th setting above and beyond the Select-O-Matic switch for a no holds barred blast of tone! Thus, when the \"Blow Switch\" is clicked on, the Dano is significantly louder than with any one or two pickup combinations. This makes playing leads easier as the guitar is automatically louder when the Blow Switch is engaged. Tuning the Mod 7 String: Seven string guitars are tuned the same way as a six string except that they have an additional low B string.Specifications: Body: Hardboard top and bottom with plywood frame. Neck: Hard maple with rosewood fingerboard. Scale: 25\u201d Frets: 21 Body Width: 42mm Headstock Width: 15.5mm Nut Width: 40mm Action: 1.6mm high 'E' / 1.8mm low 'E' Pickups: 2 Original style brass tube w/chrome plating/1 Lipstick Double Coil Magnet: Original formula 50\u2019s style Alnico magnet.
