{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale today is my absolutely fabulous Gibson SG \u201cKirk Douglas\u201d Roots Custom I REALLY hate to see this one go, but finances are what they are\u2026 Here is the Gibson description page for the Kirk Douglas SG: The Gibson data page for the Kirk Douglas SG These are almost impossible to find in really great condition. I am the first owner: it was purchased new, pre-order from my local dealer. I have certainly played it over the years. So it has smudges, and little tiny pick marks (I mostly play finger-style, but do occasionally use a pick). I have ONLY played this guitar in my home studio by me\u2026 It is in truly wonderful condition. I will easily call it a 9.6 out of 10 condition, as it was made by humans and played by a human. The case is in 9.5 out of 10 condition. This guitar is sold as-is. It is in great shape and has been in a good environment. However, returns are ONLY available for \u201cnot described correctly.\u201d Collectors? Do you want a 10? This isn\u2019t a 10. It is really a 9.6\u2026 SHIPPING Shipping: Shipping is actual cost (I don't add 'and handling\" to the charge). I do NOT participate in the eBay global shipping program for this guitar as it has Rosewood. I will ship either UPS or USPS Priority Mail, whichever works best for my abilities. Shipping notes: I work a full-time job as a software engineer. Music and gear are my passions (outside my family). I list 3 days processing time because sometimes I have to do something for work, work late, do something for my family, or similar. I have to wrap up your gear at night after work and get it down to our local shipper (Office Depot) as quickly as is possible. Sometimes, I can ship out within 24 hours, sometimes it takes a couple of BUSINESS days. I really do strive hard to do a good job for you. I want you to enjoy my gear, too! Returns: I'm selling my gear to bring money into my home. I am not a business and I don't have a monetary reserve to offer multi-thousand-dollar returns.", "ItemID": "202598584317", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T00:02:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-16T05:40:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Kirk-Douglas-SG-MINTY-OHSC-and-ALL-Original-/202598584317", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Elon, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025985843178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8T4AAOSwti5cZ6AS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/D3oAAOSwDNZcZ6AI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNTQy/z/R70AAOSwHVdcZ6AM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNTQy/z/vIQAAOSw0bpcZ6AQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/okUAAOSwTJZcZ6AV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTAy/z/79UAAOSwPjNcZ6AY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjk2/z/q6sAAOSw0TpcZ6Ac/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTc2WDE2MDA=/z/i68AAOSwpYpcZ6Ae/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzA4/z/QJ8AAOSwGoRcZ6Ah/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTgwWDE2MDA=/z/rBgAAOSwndBcZ6Aj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VAsAAOSwdC5cZ6Al/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iUEAAOSwq4xcZ6Ao/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27244", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jimpearsonguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1647, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 14, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2399.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2399.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***w", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 16}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Kirk Douglas SG MINTY with OHSC and ALL Original...", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Custom"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Aged Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 285, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2424.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The guitar is easily 9.6 out of 10.
