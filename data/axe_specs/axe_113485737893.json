{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you are looking for a strat type guitar that plays like a dream and sounds super nice clean or with high gain settings, here is your answer. This is a very nice Carvin bolt guitar made in 2008. It cost $1300.00 new in 2008. If you were to order a new one with these options it would cost you more than that and you would have to wait about two months before it shipped. It has a small chip out of the finish under the tremelo. I placed a pick there for size comparison. It was not a dent. I took and filled it with some nail polish to take and protect the wood. Also the pick guard is not original but is in good condition. You can see where it had to be trimmed and filed a bit in order to be installed around the tremelo. The guitar has no dents or dings and it is in excellent shape other than what I have mentioned already. This one features a quilted maple top on an alder body, birdseye maple fretboard, HSS pick up configuration with the option to split the bridge pick up, gold hardware, Dunlop dual strap design buttons, Wilkinson tremelo, Sperzel locking tuners, stainless frets and a satin finish neck. I have it set up with 9 guage strings with the action low. It is an awesome playing guitar. I put a Rat Fink sticker on the truss rod cover because it really plays like a hot rod too. The pick ups are pretty hot but I do not know which Carvin pick up models they are. It includes the original tweed Carvin hardcase too. The trem arm is inside of the case. Buyer will be happy. Shipping will be $55.00 to lower 48 states. It will be insured as well. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I also have another Carvin guitar listed if you want to take a look!
