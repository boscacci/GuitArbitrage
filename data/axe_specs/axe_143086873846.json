You are looking at a 2018 EVH Wolfgang Standard. Rare ZILLA BURST Quilt Maple Top Finish. Really looks like \"Godzilla\" Awesome color. Eddie Van Halen launched the shred movement almost singlehandedly, so you\u2019d expect that any Eddie-associated axe would be built for speed and maximum playability. With a 25.5\" scale and 12\"-16\" compound-radius fretboard, the bolt-on, graphite-reinforced neck delivers big time in this respect. Boasting rolled edges, the 22 frets add to the fast and silky feel. From The Web: The Wolfgang\u00ae WG Standard boasts the same style and massive sound Eddie Van Halen created, at a price the everyday musician can afford. Offering many of the blazing features as its more expensive brethren, the Wolfgang WG Standard has a basswood body with special \u201ccomfort cut\u201d forearm contour for maximum playing ease. Its one-piece bolt-on maple neck has graphite reinforcement rods to hold strong against the ravages of temperature and humidity, an oiled neck back finish and a convenient heel-mounted truss rod adjust wheel. The 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius maple fingerboard features comfortably rolled edges, 22 jumbo frets and black dot inlays. Van Halen\u2019s exacting specifications\u2014the smooth-feeling 500k pots make it easy to find a unique sound while retaining the crisp high-end sparkle of the Wolfgang pickups. The EVH-branded Floyd Rose\u00ae Special bridge and R2 locking nut consistently keep the guitar in tune through the deepest whammy dives and horse whinnies. Tested where it counts\u2014 live onstage\u2014 the Wolfgang WG Standard is decked out for playing performance and comfort and is available in a handful of stage-stealing finishes featuring black headstocks and black hardware.Our luthier did a complete setup.
