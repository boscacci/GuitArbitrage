{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Bid with confidence, I have 100% perfect feedback. This is a 1977 Gibson Melody Maker. Super low action and perfect intonation. Neck is great and beautiful one-piece mahogany body that they don't make anymore. These older pieces have a Mojo feel and tone that nothing new can touch. Cosmetically this has some issues with some weird where mark on the front as shown and some screw holes from who-knows-what. There's also a route under the pickguard for a humbucker in the bridge position which was done poorly and you can see it a little bit under the pickguard. You might not notice it but I wanted to point out for picky people. There are a few replaced Parts here and there, but it has never had a headstock repair and it has the Vintage 70s pickups. If you want a vintage collector piece to keep and cherish this is not it, but if you want a professional level vintage player this is your guitar. It comes with the vintage Daddy's Junky Music (RIP) gig bag shown. It is light and comfortable at 6.2 lbs.", "ItemID": "202552342327", "EndTime": "2019-01-24T17:01:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T22:36:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Melody-Maker-Vintage-1977-/202552342327", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cumberland, Rhode Island", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025523423278080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~Q8AAOSwqLRcRm85/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LxAAAOSw3ltcRm9Z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k7wAAOSwXTVcRm9c/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5-EAAOSwa1ZcRm9e/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1ysAAOSwakxcRm9u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lLsAAOSwckZcRm9g/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Cx4AAOSwMlNcRm9i/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ioMAAOSwxx1cRm9k/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EHkAAOSwWN5cRm9m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gAIAAOSwqLlcRm9n/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mV0AAOSwviBcRm9s/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/B1cAAOSw8a9cRm9w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "02864", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "70corin", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3122, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 749.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 749.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 846}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Melody Maker Vintage 1977 ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1977"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Melody Maker"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 964, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "118985", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118985", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
