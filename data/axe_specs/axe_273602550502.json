{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Lightly used jtv-59 in a Tobacco finish. This comes with an upgraded SKB case. All works well. In excellent shape. Included are battery and charger and VDI (variax digital interface) and usb connector. It is missing an ethernet cable that connects to VDI and the Variax. I believe a standard ethernet cable will work. I have used this guitar with my Helix pedal and the combination is amazing!
