{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Lennon Hamburg Tribute Short Scale Guitar. Condition is used but has no defects from use (see photos). This is a tribute guitar for anyone who is a Beatles freak (like I am). I took the base of the no-name mahogany solid body guitar and added the vibrato, bowtie bridge, Burns silver knobs, white tone switch cover, heavier roller wound nickel rocker 011 strings (like Lennon played), and removed the top layer of the two piece pick guard to make it a single piece (again.. all changes to make it like Lennon's early Hamburg model). There are officially 5 knobs on this guitar but in order to replicate Lennon's look, I left one pot under the pick guard as it is just a master volume and the volume can also be controlled with the other knobs. There is still an access point if you prefer to put the knob back to the surface (see photos).I have the original black knobs, top pick guard layer, and covered chrome adjustable bridge that I am happy to provide with the purchase upon request.Playing a short scale isn't for everyone, but this guitar plays nice and has that Beatles look and sound if that is what you are looking for. I mostly wanted it for the pure beauty of the guitar and I had it on display in my office. I have a move in my future though and I now need to thin the herd. I will ship to the lower 48 States only. I am happy to answer any questions you may have and will provide a 14 day return window after you receive the guitar and get a chance to inspect it. Any shipping costs associated with the return will be the responsibility of the seller and of course, the guitar must be returned in the same condition that it was received. Thanks for looking.", "ItemID": "292972902525", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T04:36:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T19:20:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lennon-Hamburg-Tribute-Short-Scale-Guitar-/292972902525", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Franklin, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929729025258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q9QAAOSwZ2pcbaQy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8nYAAOSwXlpcbaQ8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mDYAAOSwJtNcbaRG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n2QAAOSwaRBcbaRX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Z1kAAOSwhE5cbaRc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DicAAOSw9zdcbaRg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gHUAAOSwHKpcbaUG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODU=/z/tiEAAOSwu2tccrxy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37067", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "netsurfdog", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 216, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 390}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Lennon Hamburg Tribute Short Scale Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Short Scale"]}]}, "HitCount": 108, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
