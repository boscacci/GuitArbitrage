{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is a stellar 2004 MIJ Gretsch 6122-II Country Classic II with a gorgeous walnut stain. Get you Chet Atkins cover band going in style! For some time Gretsch could not use the \"Country Gentleman\" name. During this period, most Gents were known as Country Classics. The II refers to the double-cutaway model. There was also a 6122-S single-cutaway Country Classic I. In the very early revival years, the 6122-II was simply known as the 6122. The model designation picked up the II designation a bit later, better matching the model name, and differentiating it from other, more faithful recreations of the classic 6122 formula. In 2008 Gretsch regained the rights to use \"Country Gentleman\", and the Country Classic reverted to the name. Note that unlike classic Gents and more faithful modern recreations, 6122-II models have open f-holes, no mud switch, and the neck joins at the 18th fret rather than the 14th. The Gentleman itself debuted in mid-1957, after considerable input from Chet Atkins. The Closed body was a concession to Atkins, who was reportedly hounding Gretsch to produce a semi-hollow guitar with a solid block through the center capable of more sustain with less feedback. The Gentleman is a compromise, containing only a partial block down the center with sealed, imitation f-holes. The Made In Japan Country Classic II is used, but in great shape. Includes original hardshell case and all the case goodies. See pics for full cosmetic details.
