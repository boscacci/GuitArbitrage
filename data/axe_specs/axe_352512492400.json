{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a nice guitar and plays fine. Needs minor repair or play as is. I bought this guitar about 8months ago with no bridge and a stop bar screw that won't turn because the previous owner made adjustments to the height and didn't loosen the strings when making those adjustments causing the bolt on the low E side to get stuck so now it won't turn. My plan was to fix everything and keep the bird but I bought a damaged Les Paul Custom that needs more work and my time so if you're good with making repairs on instruments this will be an easy fix for you. Guitar comes with original warranty, papers, owners manual, and other case candy. Right now I have a roller bridge on the guitar but I will be including the original Nashville Tune-O-Matic Bridge with missing wire on one or two saddles along with an extra one. The tail piece bolt that is stock has scratches on it from the previous owner turning it with looks to be pliers and chipped the chrome finish. On the other side he must have used the same method because I noticed some marks on the thumb wheel and a slight scratch on the finish. I have the guitar set up for the new owner and its ready to play but if you need to lower or raise the stop bar you will need to replace the stock bolt or get it unstuck. Everything else is like new on this bird and works great. Pickups sound nice thru my Marshall and all control knobs work as they should. Everything is original on guitar. I have fresh 9-42 pure nickel strings on her. Neck relief is 0. 010\", string action low E side is 5/64\" & high e side is 4/64\" at the 15th fret. Guitar didn't come with a hardcase, only a Gibson gig bag. I will box the guitar very well so it arrives safely to your address. S&H will be actual cost from my zip code to yours via FedEx. I will not ship internationally, No P. O. Box addresses, No Commercial addresses, and No Bullshit. Parment is expected on the day auction ends. All sales are final!! I will ship Tuesday morning after auction is over on Sunday.On Nov-13-18 at 02:25:42 PST, seller added the following information: I've been asked if the original bridge works. Like I mentioned, it has a missing saddle wire or two which is why I don't have it on the guitar. It rattles without the wire to hold the screw in place but I am including a new Nashville bridge and you can use the wire from that bridge or order new ones from Stewmac. The donor bridge is brand new, so is the roller bridge. The original posts for the bridge are also included. I was asked if there are any cracks in the neck. There are no cracks, not even a finish crack. The only damage to this guitar is what I desribed in my description. The guitar is in 100% playable condition just as I have it now with the roller bridge. If you want to Nashville tunomatic bridge on the guitar you will need to fix the loose saddles and replace the stopbar post on the low E side since it is stuck and you cannot make any height adjustments on the tail piece.", "ItemID": "352512492400", "EndTime": "2018-11-18T18:05:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T18:05:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/No-Reserve-2017-Gibson-Firebird-T-Pelham-Blue-NICE-/352512492400", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Campbell, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525124924008080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/wRUAAOSwuUlb6Get/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/8yEAAOSwsptb6Gex/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/aZQAAOSwF8Fb6Gez/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/UAoAAOSw5oxb6Ge1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/6u4AAOSwaIpb6Ge5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/ZEoAAOSwpFtb6Ge7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/MkUAAOSwy45b6Ge-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/m0gAAOSwJuZb6GfA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/~KsAAOSwS6pb6GfC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/1U8AAOSwKtlb6GfE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/gxkAAOSwVoVb6Gg7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/zMkAAOSwuWJb6Hjo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "44405", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rollinstoned", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1578, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 48, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 795.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 795.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 808}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "No Reserve 2017 Gibson Firebird T Pelham Blue NICE!
