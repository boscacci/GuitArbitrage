{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello Fellow ebay musicians, up for auction here is a very good condition Ibanez S7421QM 7 String guitar with a beautiful quilted maple top finished in see through red. Striking finish and appearance on this one. This guitar has been used very little and never left my house to be honest with you. Played only at home so fret wear is minimal. Was always stored in a hard shell case (NOT INCLUDED) The \"S\" series Ibanez guitars are my favorite - they are Sleek and slender fighting machines - extremely comfortable to play - I definitely prefer them over the \"R\" series guitars The condition is very good with perhaps a small amount of pick swirling and light scratches here an there. Included in this auction will be a Fender soft shell case. This case is in good working condition. This is a great guitar that I hate to let go of but I am not using it enough to merit holding onto it and other needs are calling. This is a great opportunity to pick up a beautiful 7 string that you have always wanted to get!Ibanez Manual also included Shipping will be $50 to the LOWER 48 UNITED STATES ONLY. While the sale of this item is final, please look over my feedback and bid with confidence. Please email me through ebay if you have any questions Thank you for viewing my auction.", "ItemID": "292786591193", "EndTime": "2018-11-01T01:21:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-25T01:21:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-S7421QM-7-String-Quilted-maple-top-Very-Nice-Gig-bag-included-/292786591193", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Citrus Heights, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2927865911938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/dFMAAOSwRZdbnzJA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/WxgAAOSwFnxbnzJI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7okAAOSw~p1bnzJQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/nlwAAOSwM9xbnzIp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/VQ8AAOSwgh5bnzIx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/nnAAAOSwM9xbnzI4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/w-IAAOSwckBbnzIg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95621", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tapestryoftempo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 342, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 289.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 289.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***4", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 10}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez S7421QM 7 String Quilted maple top Very Nice!
