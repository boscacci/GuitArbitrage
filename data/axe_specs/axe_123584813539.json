{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Includes strap locks and a generic Thommann Hard Case. Here we have an awesome Skervesen Shoggie. I bought this used a few months bag and I really have enjoyed it. However, I find myself playing less metal and getting more into jazz and blues, so I have decided to let this one go. The fretwork on this guitar is awesome, the frets don't hang and they are level. The neck is extremely smooth and comfortable. The body shape nicely contours to the body. The Bare Knuckle Blackhawks sound amazing and are excellent for metal! This does use an official Strandberg bridge, as shown. The bridge is excellent and feels great. There is one issue though, the e and b fine tuners sometimes rub together since they are so close. All of the electronics work as they should. Condition: Overall, the guitar is in great condition, but it does show some light wear to it, as shown in the photos. Please view them closely to get an accurate idea of the condition. There is a ding on the upper horn of the guitar (photos 3 & 7). There is a small ding on the side of the body (photo 4). Another ding under the tone control on the edge of the body (photo 6). A small ding behind the top horn by the strap button (photo 9). On top of this, there are light pick scratch and polish swirls from normal use. Specs:Bare Knuckle Black Hawk humbuckers with coil tap. Body is Swamp Ash body with AAAAA Maple Top Multiscale design with Strandberg bridge and locking nut. Multiscale Scale length: 25\u201d-26\u201d Guitar will ship in a Thommann Hard Case.", "ItemID": "123584813539", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T03:51:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T23:09:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Skervesen-Shoggie-6-String-Multiscale-Green-Burst-Electric-Guitar-Headless-Fanne-/123584813539", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lucerne Valley, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235848135398080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CooAAOSwK1RcC3np/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g6YAAOSwa3lcC3nr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tK0AAOSwPrtcC3nt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x48AAOSws99cC3nv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/73AAAOSwOnJcC3ny/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nK0AAOSwVP5cC3n0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oCcAAOSwQqZcC3n2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/maQAAOSwSidcC3n5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QLgAAOSwjTtcC3n7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x5wAAOSws99cC3n-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NcYAAOSwRF1cC3oA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "92356", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mindyhull", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 351, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1890.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1890.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Skervesen Shoggie 6-String Multiscale Green Burst Electric Guitar Headless Fanne", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Skervesen"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Headless"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 302, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
