Ebony fingerboard with Abalone & Pearl inlays. Ibanez large frets with very little wear. Gold hardware shows type of wear very common to Ibanez guitars of this age, mostly around bridge pickup, but not bad. Binding is a nice, aged yellow with no cracks or checking. Sure Grip knobs, Gibraltar II bridge with quick change tailpiece. Original case shows some wear and scuffs. I have owned this wonderful guitar for over twenty-five years. Played infrequently and always cased. It plays beautifully and has stellar sound with outstanding sustain. Selling because it is time to thin my collection.
