{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1967 Fender Coronado II in the very rare Blonde with white binding finish. According to Wikipedia, only one other Blonde Coronado exists. I don't know if this is a refinish, but the binding is completely intact. This one has some modifications that make it a very versatile player's guitar as well as a serious collector's item. The crappy DeArmond OEM pickups are gone. The neck pickup is a coil-split DiMarzio X2N; the bridge pickup is a Seth Lover-designed 1977 Fender Humbucker. The pickguard is gone - it just got in the way. One of the original Fender tuners was replaced with a very similar tuner. All the tuners work. The thin neck profile plays like crazy. The coil split allows a very Fender sound, while the two powerful humbuckers give you everything you need for rock, blues, country and everything in-between. Classic, elegant looks; smooth vintage playability; Fender and DiMarzio tone; this crazy-cool Coronado has it all! A solid wood, true semi-hollow made in USA Fender - nothing like the Chinese-made Coronado reissues. Includes a Gibson hardshell case - it's a 70s Gibson Grabber bass case, but it fits great and protects way better than the chipboard cases that came with Coronados, IMHO. From Wikipedia: Coronado II two pickups\u2014neck and bridge positions\u2014two volume and two tone controls, as well as a three-position selector switch. Block inlays. Optional tremolo. Cherry, Sunburst, DuPont custom colors. Only one Blonde Coronado is known to exist, it is in a private collection in California. (If this Blonde Coronado has Black Binding, it is Olympic White that has \"yellowed\" over the years). The body and neck wood is maple with a Rosewood fingerboard and mother-of-pearl block inlays and a Fender Jazzmaster style headstock", "ItemID": "202441363698", "EndTime": "2019-01-30T04:28:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-18T16:25:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Coronado-II-Vintage-1967-RARE-Blonde-Fender-DiMarzio-humbuckers-HSC-/202441363698", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Wendell, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2024413636988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/iAQAAOSwTA9X6VH8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/jJwAAOSwTA9X6VIR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg2MDg=/z/0MUAAOSw8gVX6VIz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI1Nlg5MDA=/z/s~IAAOSwzaJX6VJV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/nYoAAOSwNRdX6VJs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/pbgAAOSwmLlX6VKE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/qVUAAOSwmLlX6VKa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/rBcAAOSwTA9X6VKs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/mMYAAOSw4shX6VLG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/0hsAAOSwzaJX6VLc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/lqAAAOSwLF1X6VLs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTA=/z/3qoAAOSwzaJX6VMR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01379", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nexus801", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 896, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2879}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Coronado II, Vintage 1967, RARE Blonde, Fender/DiMarzio humbuckers, HSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Manufacturer Part Number", "Value": ["Coronado II"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1967"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blond"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Seth Lover Fender humbucker"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full"]}]}, "HitCount": 987, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
