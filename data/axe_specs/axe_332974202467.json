{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Discount for Christmas of $200.00 Was $1499.00 now $1299.00 A Beautiful, Great-playing Solidbody Electric Guitar from Taylor!The Taylor Custom Electric Guitar brings the company's innovative spirit to the world of solidbody electric instruments. Taylor designed the Custom Electric Guitar from the ground up with original 3/4-size humbuckers, a sleek aluminum bridge, and contoured ergonomic single cutaway body design. A shaded edge Hawaiian koa top, alongside an Australian blackwood body and neck contribute to the Custom Electric's singing, solidbody tone. Appointments include mother-of-pearl neck inlays and ivoroid binding. This guitar plays like a dream. Sounds great and has no signs of playware. No pick marks, scratches, beltbuckle rash or shirt button marks. Nothing that would keep this fine instrument from being \"as new\". This guitar was my backup guitar that I never had to use. Update: I am selling this guitar because I fell in love with and have already purchased a Santa Cruz om acoustic guitar. I plan on doing more acoustic music in the coming year. I have a long history on eBay with a 100% positive feedback profile. I've been here since the start around 1999. I ship fast and secure. It will be packed by me personally and fully insured to protect your investment. Should the carrier loose or damage the guitar, I will file all claims necessary to guarantee a full refund. Check my feedback and bid with confidence. I buy as much as I sell or more, so I understand how important it is to provide accurate discriptions, be easy to contact, ship quickly and securely. I am not a business, just a player who in order to enjoy music, must buy and sell at times to help support my hobby. So, please do your homework and know that this is the guitar you want. No returns please. If it arrives not as discribed due to mishandling, the buyer must pay for return shipping. Paypal is preferred for payment or please contact me before bidding if that is a problem. Bidders with excessive negative feedback will get their bids cancelled. You can trust my feedback. I really enjoy selling on eBay and meeting other musicians.Heros57 FeedbackFrom Buyer/priceWhenGreatedgarleonserrano ( 17) During past year Fender Vintage American 60s Hotrod Telecaster 3 Color Sunburst (#332447266822)US $1,249.00Best Offer Price was Accepted Good deal on a Keeley pedal.
