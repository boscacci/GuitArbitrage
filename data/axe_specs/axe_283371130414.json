{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Les Paul Type Custom Guitar. Got this year's ago body most likely asian in origin. On the headstock it has an inlay of a famous guitar making company brand. Killer guitar I added authentic Gibson Klusons with green buttons and a Slash signature Seymour Duncan pickup wired Straight to one Gibson 500k volume pot, ala Billy Gibbons, no bullsh*t just pure tone. Great guitar. Could use a setup as it has sat in my basement virtually unplayed for years. Guy who owned it before me had it playing real nice frets feel great are are basically 100% (makes me think he got fretwork done to it but unsure) missing some screws(only two holes drilled) on control plate on the back and it has some finish blemishes here and there. Altogether a good guitar that I will start the bidding at the price of the Skb TSA flight case that comes with it. Let me know if you have any questions. Free shipping lower 48 via ups, no shipping outside lower 48. Ask any questions before buying/bidding as I don't except returns. PayPal only please no Echecks or wierd crap like that.", "ItemID": "283371130414", "EndTime": "2019-02-18T18:14:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-08T18:14:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Les-Paul-Type-Custom-Guitar-LP-Sunburst-Slash-Gibbons-/283371130414", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Greeley, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833711304148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/FFIAAOSwRaFcXcOQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/PooAAOSwTJZcXcOV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/GIIAAOSw3eRcXcOa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/NFYAAOSw2cRcXcOe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/xpcAAOSwWiJcXcOg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/gdUAAOSwwmlcXcOj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/AVwAAOSwd5xcXcOn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/UEAAAOSwdvVcXcOp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/1mwAAOSwUDZcXcOs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/o0MAAOSwJD1cXcOv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/0JIAAOSwCrtcXcOx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/D24AAOSwmvtcXcO0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80634", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "octovius", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 641, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 234.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 234.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 12}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Les Paul Type Custom Guitar LP Sunburst Slash Gibbons", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}]}, "HitCount": 568, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 237.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
