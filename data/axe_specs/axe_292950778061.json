{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1970s Teisco Lyle \"Big Boy\" Jazz Hollow Body Sunburst Archtop Guitar MIJ Up for sale we have a Vintage Teisco Archtop Guitar. This teisco with added \"Lyle\" which is a logo of either late 70s or 80s guitar shop or guitar distribute. This guitar works great and all the pick ups sound clear but keep in mind its an older teisco guitar from the 1970s and isn't made as well as modern guitars or say a telecaster. That's by design I'm afraid so as with any MIJ COPY type guitars they will always have their quirks! That said, the guitar is in very good shape for its age and plays well and is ready to rock. It plays great and the tone is very bright! Looks amazing and cool! No case. The guitar also has minor superficial dings, scratches, wear and tear around various parts of the guitar. Typical of a guitar of this age. Everything works and the guitar sounds great. Not to mention it looks amazing! The guitar works great and the intonation is in good shape. The neck feels wonderful. As with any guitar that\u2019s been sitting in storage it going to need new strings and set up. Please consider this when bidding on my items. Its vintage folks and anything this old will need a minor tune up. Headstock: Tuner functions, no bent shafts. Nut: Seems ok Neck & Fingerboard: No cracks, inlays secure, binding secure, fingerboard is clean, neck secure Action: Fair to good (Remeber its MIJ Teisco!) Frets: Fine Body: Original Bridge: Stock seems ok Electronics: All good! Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Shipping, Payment & Important Details.
