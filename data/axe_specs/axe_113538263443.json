{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 2014 PRS S2 Singlecut Semi-hollow guitar, not new, but also not used, actually pristine. This guitar was purchased as NOS in 2018 for a studio project that never came to be and has sat unused ever since. It's essentially as new from the store. It's a guitar in search of a player. You can read many great reviews for the PRS S2 Singlecut Semi-hollows. If you are here looking at this guitar you probably already know what you need to know about this line that was introduced in 2013. They have a fabulous sound, lighter weight, great pickups. They are likely to become a new classic as they are in an approachable price range and perform even above their cost. This one has been kept safe, but shouldn't wait longer to be owned and played by someone who wants a beautiful sounding and looking guitar with PRS build quality.
