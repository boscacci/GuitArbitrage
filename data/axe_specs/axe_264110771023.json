{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this Gibson Les Paul Studio Deluxe in a beautiful and rare Caribbean Night finish. The guitar was made in the USA in 2013 at the very reputable Nashville plant. Overall, the guitar looks, plays, and sounds great!The guitar has been played and shows some signs of use. There are some small scratches and dings throughout the guitar, but nothing that affects the integrity or playability of the instrument. The frets are in fantastic shape with very little wear. The slim tapered neck is very comfortable to hold and the guitar is a real pleasure to play. The Gibson Burstbucker pickups sound amazing and are very versatile, especially with the optional push/push coil tap that can be activated on the respective neck or bridge volume knob. The active +10db boost has been bypassed and now woks as a passive kill switch that can be activated by the push/push tone knob. This can be easily and cheaply converted back to stock by a competent tech if desired. These Gibson Les Paul Deluxe guitars have been discontinued in this Caribbean Night finish and are becoming harder to come by. Don't miss your chance to own this awesome guitar! Comes with a nice fitted SKB hardshell case that is also in very good condition.Please feel free to ask any questions or make an offer!", "ItemID": "264110771023", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T17:49:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T22:49:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2013-Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Deluxe-Caribbean-Night-Electric-Guitar-USA-/264110771023", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cathedral City, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641107710238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FY0AAOSwxHlcKUsx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xUMAAOSwRWZcKUtE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Tf0AAOSwlLlcKUtF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cbEAAOSw64xcKUtH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mAIAAOSwLKhcKUtC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~68AAOSwTQNcKUtF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iIoAAOSwiOZcKUtF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1vgAAOSwO6NcKUtG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J2UAAOSw~llcKUtH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Pc8AAOSwlkpcKUtH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4XsAAOSwQZdcKUtF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xi0AAOSwS2lcKUtF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mydeadblues", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 215, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 888.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 888.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1086}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2013 Gibson Les Paul Studio Deluxe Caribbean Night Electric Guitar USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}]}, "HitCount": 803, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
