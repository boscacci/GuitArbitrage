{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "JAY TURSER JT136 JAZZ SEMI-HOLLOWBODY GUITAR+ROAD RUNNER CASE+STRAP=LOW BIN=ENDS SUN 11:59PM EST. ** FROM MY GUITAR COLLECTION IS A GREAT LOOKING AND SOUNDING JAY TURSER JT-136 JAZZ GUITAR WITH A ROAD RUNNER HARD CASE AND A BLACK LEATHER STRAP. THE GUITAR IS IN GREAT OVERALL CONDITION EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHTLY ROUGH LOOKING REPAIR AROUND THE JACK INPUT HOLE. IT REALLY DOESN'T LOOK THAT BAD UNLESS YOU ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT IT CLOSE UP(A GUITAR REPAIR SHOP COULD EASILY INSTALL A JACK COVER FOR IT). ALSO--MY PIC OF IT MAKES IT LOOK WORSE THAN IT IS. OTHER THAN THAT ONE MINOR ISSUE THE GUITAR LOOKS AND SOUNDS AMAZING! I'M ONLY ACCEPTING PAYMENT VIA PAYPAL AND I'M CURRENTLY ONLY SHIPPING TO THE LOWER 48 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
