{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Everything you need A-Z For Sale - We Have a Buy It Now item! Godin Flat Five 2002 Semi-Hollow Body Electric Guitar Includes: Godin Flat 5 Semi-hollow body guitarGodin Hard shell case See all zoomed in pics for condition & everything included! If its not pictured, its not included, unless noted otherwise. Item Description: This item is used and shows some cosmetic wear, mostly on the body - the back has scratches in the wood (see pics), theres also scratches on front side of body and on the neck, along with a few dings. Regardless of these minor blemishes that have occurred throughout its 15 years in existence, this guitar is in very nice condition overall! Plays nice, sounds nice, neck is straight, and theres no major problems that affect its operation. And its pretty lightweight weighing approximately 7.9 lbs. Please see all zoomed in pics for the exact item youll receive. Not sure if the year made is a 2002 or 2003. Based on some research, I've found that Godin\u2019s year runs from August 1st to July 31st, instead of January 1st to December 31st. The serial # on this guitar is 03 05 4 470, whereas the first 2 digits (03) represent the year that the guitar was built. But this is not the calendar year. Godin\u2019s year runs from August 1st to July 31st. So the first 2 digits (03), technically represent the year ended. Digits 3 & 4 represent the week of the year that the guitar was built \u2013 remember that the Godin year is August 1st to July 31st. So week 1 is the first week of August. This means it was built in the 5th week of the year ended July 31st, 2005. So it was the 1st week of September 2002. ************* Pictures are of actual item(s), unless stated otherwise in description. See all zoomed in photos to see whats included & for item(s) condition.
