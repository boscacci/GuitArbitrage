{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "At Canton Music we don't send out an instrument that's been sitting in a warehouse for months, we send you the EXACT instrument that you see pictured. Before shipping out any instrument, we make sure it gets the approval of our in house tech, Dr. Bones. In addition to Dr. Bones' 12-Point inspection, he'll often write his own review of the instrument and we'll feature it in the description. Calling all SouthPaws! Just got this Lefty Ibanez Gio in, such a great player. The GRG120BDXL Left-Handed Electric Guitar is an irresistable bargain from Ibanez, featuring the playability, warranty, and set-up of their more expensive instruments, but at a rock bottom price. It's all about the neck and this guitar gets a super-fast one made from a single piece of maple with a radiused fingerboard and shark teeth inlays. Powerful Ibanez-designed humbuckers provide plenty of output and are perfect for getting overdriven sounds. The GRG120BDX also comes equipped with an upgraded FAT-6 tremolo bridge that'll inspire you while keeping everything in tune.FEATURESLeft-handed model Resonant basswood body Slim & comfortable 1pc maple neck Fingerboard with white shark teeth inlay Ibanez designed humbucker pickups: Powersound-1 neck, Powersound-2 bridge Volume, Tone and 3-way selector controls Low profile Ibanez FAT-6 tremolo bridge Black Hardware For your protection all orders over $99 will be shipped signature required.", "ItemID": "113045123194", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T18:54:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-06-07T13:37:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Gio-GRGBD120XL-Left-Handed-Electric-Guitar-Black-Locking-Tremelo-/113045123194", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Canton, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1130451231948080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/7bwAAOSwQTRb5KL5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/scUAAOSwGD1b5KL~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/mMEAAOSwXnBb5KO0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/SCUAAOSwmT1b5KPG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/w9IAAOSwatBb5KPO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/UncAAOSwVBVb5KPZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/-NgAAOSwvYRb5KPh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/7wEAAOSwT-pb5KPz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/lP4AAOSwG-xb5KQC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/NcgAAOSwEYpb5KQK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg4MDE=/z/ydkAAOSw95lbGFQX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/yRYAAOSwBVdb5KQV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44718", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cantonmusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 103, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 243.3, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 243.3, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***z", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 214}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Gio GRGBD120XL Left Handed Electric Guitar in Black Locking Tremelo", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 1754, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1768770983", "StoreName": "CantonMusic"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
