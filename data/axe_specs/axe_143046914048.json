Vintage 1976 Fender Starcaster in great condition. The guitar and case are all original from 1976. This model includes the Seth Lover wide range humbucker pickups. Neck is in excellent condition. The frets are original with just under medium room left. Plays nice along the neck with a little fret buzz at the high e and b string 3rd, 2nd fret due to slight fret unevenness. The nut was replaced professionally at some point, same width and scale as the original. It could use a fret dressing for the 2nd and 3rd fret at some point, but it's been kept the same, due to the vintage frets. Everything sounds and looks great, but there is one serious blemish on the guitar contained in the last picture. There is a section on the bottom side of the guitar where the finish had been peeled off from a guitar strap that was left in the case on its side for years. As the years went by, the guitar straps makeup, bonded with the finish on the side of the starcaster and permanently altered the finish on that spot. You can't see the finish removal spot when looking straight at the guitar, only on that side edge. It looks bad, but the wood body is fine, it just took a layer of poly and color off. Besides that spot, the finish is in great shape for its age. One more blemish though, the number portion of the serial number after 76 has been rubbed off at some point. I believe this guitar had the stamped serial number before they went to the darker inked in labeling in 1976. If you can get over those two blemishes, it's a great guitar that feels good Priced accordingly, relative to other listings for this fine instrument. Original hard case included. No Fender logo on the original case. Thanks! Buyer must have great feedback. https://youtu.be/HcBnKbXvlqI", "ItemID": "143046914048", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T05:12:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T15:52:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1976-Vintage-Fender-Starcaster-Sunburst-W-Case-All-Original-/143046914048", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Columbus, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430469140488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VAwAAOSwrslaVaWT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/geYAAOSwPkBaVaWV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/okYAAOSwJH5aVaWX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NHsAAOSwtDdaVaWZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uooAAOSwkh9aVaWb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JNYAAOSwuHdaVaWd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CW4AAOSwicpaVaWe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Kz8AAOSwusdaVaWh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JO0AAOSwuHdaVaWj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6Z0AAOSwrnRaVaYF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1NcAAOSwFmxaVaYH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~XgAAOSwODFaVanj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "43235", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "peppers83", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 274, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3599.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 212}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1976 Vintage Fender Starcaster Sunburst W/Case, All Original", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 280, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
