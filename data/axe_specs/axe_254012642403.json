It is 3way toggle switch and all pods and output jack and 1 capacitor and all wiring. Maybe the trussrod cover is not original. There are scratches and dents. But fatal damage is not. I was shooting a lot of photos. Please confirm with a photograph. It was manufactured in 2010. I have an impression that this guitar is not used much. The evidence is the amount of frets remaining. The Frets are Many remain. The deterioration of the metal parts is few, the state is very good ! The body shape is very stereoscopic. Heavy Metal music only !! It is such a shape. It looks is aggressive !! Thanks to neck-through, the high position is smooth like a slide. And the finger board of ebony is shining black. This FOREST is High-end model in Edwards, and made in Japan. Brand New price is about US$ 1,400 in japan. Making is very polite. You can feel the made in japan. About guitar play, Current state, the space between the strings and the frets is very narrow. And, remaining amount of the Frets is so many. Thanks to that, I feel very easy to play the guitar anyway. You can play the guitar with a light touch. This FOREST is neck neck-through structure. The Neck-through structure has high operability of high position. Playability is high. Un pluged sound is very loud. You can feel vibrations transmitted to the body. I am sorry, I do not know the pickups name. However it gives you a good distortion sound. In my impression, bridge pickup is a sound similar to the Seymour Duncan JB. It is very powerful and distortion sound. I recommend for Heavy Metal music !! And I recommend to technical guitar players. ESP EDWARDS is Great ! It is cleanliness. I polished with guitar exclusive polish, so it is in a very clean state. I cleaned the Fingerboard with Lemon Oil. Current neck condition, very good ! roughly straight ! There is no problem with the Truss rod and it can be adjusted. Remaining the frets are 98% on average. There remains many !! You can play immediately after it is delivered to you. I was set new strings. Regular tuning. ( Inch : 009, 011, 016, 024, 032, 042 ) Guitar playing, is comfortable. All is working well. It is in a very good condition. The GIG BAG include.
