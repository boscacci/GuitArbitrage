{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale, BC Rich Bich Exotic Classic 10. This guitar comes from a BC Rich collector. Guitar is in excellent condition! - no dings, no scratches, no scuffs \u201clike new\u201d condition. Zero fret ware. I purchased this guitar four years ago, and it has hung on my wall ever since. I played guitar for about 10 minutes and then hung on my wall to enjoy. The guitar neck is fully bound, with neck-through construction. If you've never played one of these BC Rich neck-through construction models... They are one of finest guitars you will probably ever play. These models are also renowned for their sustain. The neck features classic \u201ccloud\u201d inlays. These 10 string guitars are becoming very difficult to find, because BC Rich has discontinued the manufacturing of them unless custom ordered. You can run the guitar in 10 string or 6 string mode. I typically run my Bich\u2019s in 6 string mode, but I left the extra four strings on this advertisement. Removing the additional four strings does not affect the normal playability of the guitar either way. If you don't have $4,000 - $5,000 to spend on a US-made custom shop, these Korean made models are fantastic alternatives. The Guitar comes the original hard shell case. The guitar will be securery packed, and promptly shipped. Buyer pays for shipping. Normal shipping UPS ground in the lower 48 usually costs approximately $100.", "ItemID": "173706707391", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T01:30:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T19:22:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/BC-Rich-Bich-Exotic-Classic-10-/173706707391", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Kemah, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737067073918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/shkAAOSwQzJcIS8w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/spkAAOSwZbVcIS9u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/jY0AAOSwlfNcIS9P/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/DJkAAOSw64xcIS9Y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/JVwAAOSwNXpcIS9i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/kFsAAOSwT5tcIS97/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/G5oAAOSwjNdcIS-O/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/ajcAAOSwUHBcIS~R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "77565", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ththoma.blho7anvv", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 42, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 87}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "BC Rich Bich Exotic Classic 10", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Walnut"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["USA Custom Shop"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["B.C.
