{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this fantastic Feiten Black Supernova Futura Electric Guitar This guitar is in great condition, there are minimal signs of wear such as some hairline scratches on the body and a mark on the guitars bridge. None of this affects the functionality of the guitar or even really distracts from how nice looking this Feiten Black Supernova Futura Electric Guitar looks. This is an authentic Feiten Supernova guitar guaranteed or your money back. The Futura is designed to be an ultra-comfortable, versatile instrument that can be configured with different pickup combinations to suit the player's style and taste. As with the Classic, the rear loaded design increases the sustain, and sounds tighter and punchier than the standard top loaded version, because the cavity for each pickup is MUCH smaller, and the 1/2\" pickup mounting plate increases sustain and sound transfer to the body by maximizing the vibration from the pickups, WITHOUT interrupting the top vibration. The plate with the pickups attached acts as a \u201cresonator\u201d, and the increase in sustain is amazing. The Humbucking bridge pickup is a terrific option when I want a fat, punchy bridge sound, and when combined with the warm transparent DP-420 neck pickup, the versatility of the Futura is incredible. The neck pickup is a whopping 11k output, with gorgeous top end, and inspires everything from Wes to Hendrix/ SRV and beyond. It's the TONE that makes the Futura SO much fun to play... It's hard to put down once you pick it up! Please take a look at the pictures provided and if you have any questions please feel free to ask and we will respond as quickly as possible. What you see in the pictures is exactly what you will get. THANK YOU & GOOD LUCK!
