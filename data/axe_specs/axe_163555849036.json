{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hi, I am selling this beautiful American Cherry Red 1952 Reissue Telecaster chambered from the 2004 Namm show. There were only about 200 of these made for the show. One style was a spruce top and the other an ash top chambered body. This is the ash model and less than 100 were made out of the 200 special made 52 telecasters with 60's style necks. This guitar is beautiful as you can see. The neck feels like butter. No dead frets on this baby. You can bend full step and still no fret outs. The guitar is in beautiful shape. It only has one scratch worth mentioning on the lower back as seen in the picture. Guitar has the Fender reissue tan case with yellow lining and the guitar still has all of the original paper work as seen in the picture. Very limited model and super beautiful. Wood grain looks great under the see through cherry red. All slot head screws like on a 1952 Telecaster. One of the coolest reissues Fender made. \"USA BIDS ONLY PLEASE. NO INTERNATIONAL BIDS\".", "ItemID": "163555849036", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T22:50:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T22:50:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-52-Chambered-USA-reissue-Less-than-200-made-2004-Namm-Show-/163555849036", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "North Richland Hills, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635558490368080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/KeMAAOSwqiRcbdR6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/qMMAAOSwHSVcbdLy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/5R0AAOSwKmhcbdMX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/6d4AAOSw4AJcbdNG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/j84AAOSwAE9cbdNl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/Y1QAAOSwRiFcbdOI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/Y3gAAOSwDcJcbdO-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/kdEAAOSwHNtcbdPx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/1XUAAOSwZVpcbdRW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/enAAAOSwpLxcbdTp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "76180", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dino1110_0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 747, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 976}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster 52 Chambered USA reissue.
