{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2017 LsL One Series Bad Bone 2 HH One-piece Maple Neck Sugar Pine Body Butterscotch Finish Aged/Relic in very good to excellent used condition. Our T-bone is a re-creation of the best a \u201850\u2019s or \u201860 vintage T-style guitar has to offer and more. We start by selecting the best possible materials and then make them right here in our shop. We make the bodies, necks, truss rods, pickups, saddles and pick guards all here. Each body is built and detailed by hand. Each neck is hand shaped. Then we lay on the thinnest possible nitrocellulose lacquer finish and that finish is then weather checked. This creates a very airy, open, articulate tone that is then enhanced by our own, LsL hand-wound pickups. This is as close as you can get to achieving the tone, playability, look and feel of a vintage guitar. Our T-bones have found their way into the hands of many a player who has replaced their 50\u2019s-vintage instrument with ours. The best materials, best processes and a love and care for each guitar are what makes the T-bone the new standard in vintage-style instruments. All of these guitars are tone monsters. LSL makes a special switch tip for all the Bad Bones that has an inlaid pearl dot in the center, 'just for a tiny touch of class.' Personal notes: This very guitar was first offered by Wild West Guitars here: https://wildwestguitars.com/electric/lsl-bad-bone-2-hh-maple-fretboard-butterscotch-aged This guitar is sweet. The only reason I am selling is because I have gone to the dark side - Gibson. I just like the shorter scale length. This guitar is 25.5 inch Fender scale. Pickups are really nice - never harsh or shrilly (coil tap is useless to me). Neck feels great and a nice build. Light weight and handles fast at 7 pounds. There is weather checking all over this guitar, but it is hard to show in the pics. 21 frets like a tele should have! Very little fret wear. 96% of life left and nice frets. Good looking desirable guitar in a relic finish under 2K. Look at the build sheet from LSL for details and let me know if you have any further questions.", "ItemID": "202584453633", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T11:47:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-02T01:31:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2017-LsL-One-Series-Bad-Bone-2-HH-1piece-Maple-Neck-Sugar-Pine-Aged-Relic-Guitar-/202584453633", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lewisville, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025844536338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LDoAAOSwEGBcHdmo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/4mkAAOSwvGZcHdmo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODc0WDUxMQ==/z/RfIAAOSwxZxcHdmn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/pboAAOSwgnJcHdmo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/PGoAAOSwwkRcHdmo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/0xgAAOSwM6FcHdmo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L-AAAOSwuQhcHdmo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RCgAAOSworNcHdmp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tB0AAOSwvdFcHdmr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/slQAAOSwsftcHdmq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0CkAAOSwvpVcHdms/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzg3WDY2MQ==/z/nSoAAOSw~D5cHqgm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "75067", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "street-racing-apparel", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1135, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1575.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***5", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2017 LsL One Series Bad Bone 2 HH 1piece Maple Neck Sugar Pine Aged Relic Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple", "Pine"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["LSL"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Butterscotch"]}]}, "HitCount": 170, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
