{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "BC Rich released a stylized guitar each month and one for the year overall in 2003. They were well received for their unique look being taken a step further by now including artwork on the front at an affordable price without needing to have an artist friend with spare time. Fire Breather is the two headed dragon pictured Iver the iconic Mockingbird body shape. Definitely a crowd pleaser and an eye catcher. Electronics tested and working. Hardcase available at extra cost or separate purchase. Message for inquiry. As you can see, I'm pricing to move inventory, so I'm sure I can beat other prices out there easily and significantly in some cases. But for now let's be clear LISTING ONLY INCLUDES THE GUITAR PICTURED. Case will be a totally separate listing unless we barter an adjusted price to include with this purchase, and in such a case it will be a noted addition on the packing slip. Ok, that needed to be said to be clear and cover my butt. Just got over a dispute with someone demanding free stuff just because I mentioned it was a possible option for a separate deal. They even opened a Paypal case.
