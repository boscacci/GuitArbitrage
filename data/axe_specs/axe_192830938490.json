{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "BC Rich Mockingbird NJ Classic Series I've always wanted a USA made BC Rich, but couldn't justify paying the high price for one. The next best thing was an NJ Classic Series upgraded with top shelf hardware and electronics. In 2011 I came across this guitar and began putting it together. I'm not sure the year of manufacturer. I searched Google, but ran into a site claiming you can't date them from the serial number. My best guess is early 2000's? I threw in a couple of brand new, first year, \"patent applied for\" Tony Iommi Gibson pickups. The pickups alone were $189.00 each. Then an early 80's Gibson TP-6 Tailpiece, Faber locking bridge, vintage Grover bullseye tuners, CTS pots, Switchcraft pickup selector switch and input jack, orange drop capacitor, and I shielded the control cavity with copper shielding for a very quiet, no hum guitar. This guitar rocks!!! The action is amazing, the ebony fingerboard is smooth, and the neck-thru design adds sustain and is very comfortable. Some research revealed that the neck is made from hard maple, but I couldn't find what the body materials are. Whatever it is, it's some very attractive wood. BTW, the neck is NOT scarf jointed at the headstock like so many made in Korea guitars are. This seems like it's built like the US made models, with the exception of a veneered quilt maple top, which in my opinion the guitar would've been just fine without. I did not install the screws on the tuners because they have a stamped notch that locks them in place once you install and tighten them. I've never had a problem with them moving after installation so didn't feel the need to make extra holes. The guitar has no buckle rash, and no dents or dings anywhere on the body or neck. It includes a non-original Roadrunner hardshell case. Please see all the extra pictures below. Different interests have me selling most of my collection, as I hardly play anymore. The guitar is for sale to the contiguous US only. I travel for work, but I'm usually back after three days of travel and can ship once I return should you make a purchase when I'm on the road. If I'm home I can usually ship the next day. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or requests for additional pictures.
