{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "*****Scroll down to see 45 HD images of this guitar***** Here's a pretty rare 1995 Gibson Les Paul Classic Plus in a factory original Cherry Sunburst finish. This guitar is in very good condition and has light playwear. The top is almost perfect - just a few micro marks and some faint clear coat micro scratches - the back has a slight mark or two as well- see pics. Only Premium Plus tops have LPPP hand written in the pickup cavity. All the electronics work well - all the pots date to 1995 - solder joints are unmolested. The neck is straight and the frets are in excellent condition. The pickups are the original Gibson USA humbucker pickups Alnico 496R & 500T if I'm not mistaken. It has just been detailed. The front, back, sides and neck were waxed and buffed with a high grade carnuba wax. The frets were polished and the fingerboard was cleaned, buffed and moisturized with an instrument grade lemon oil. It was set up with 10/46's, adjusted and plays very nicely. All the electronics work well. She has a slim 60's neck profile and weighs 8.2 lbs on a digital scale. Comes with the original Gibson hardshell case as seen in the pictures.
