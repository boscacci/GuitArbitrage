{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered here is a 2006 Godin Freeway Classic in very good used condition. Please see the 9th pic as it shows the only noticeable ding in this guitar, at the top edge of the lower bout above the tremolo. Other than this, there are very minor pic marks and some scuffing associated with normal play and use. The wine red paint is very nice, and the maple neck, head stock and rosewood fret board are really nice wood grain. Comes with humbucker/single coil/ humbucker pick up configuration. These are quality built in the USA, from top Canadian maple and tone wood components, and are highly regarded instruments. Freshly strung with 9 - 46s. Neck is straight and truss rod fully adjustable. This guitar plays very nicely. Look around and compare to average price. Check out GodinGuitars.com for more info. It will come with and packed in the case as shown. It's not a great case, but it will keep the guitar safe! It's got a dent in the top and is missing one of the latch snaps, but is clean inside and will do the job. Shipping is to Canada and the lower 48 U.S. only. Please ask any questions prior to bidding/buying. Thank you!", "ItemID": "183637073633", "EndTime": "2019-01-22T03:15:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-15T03:15:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Godin-Freeway-Classic-06-Wine-Red-Very-Nice-/183637073633", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Whitby, Ontario", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836370736338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/a0MAAOSwOShcPM3x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/GyYAAOSwqLlcPM1Y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/raYAAOSw5AhcPM2H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Qt8AAOSw6JhcPM1z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/jtQAAOSwSONcPM2V/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/f~YAAOSwW~FcPM2f/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/HGsAAOSw1IhcPM2p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/v7EAAOSws0pcPM3F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/AZ0AAOSwbKVcPM3n/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/giUAAOSwdxFcPM3T/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "L1N 7K9", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "romacpherso_5", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 135.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 179.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2401}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Godin Freeway Classic 06 Wine Red Very Nice!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Godin"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 270, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 181.5, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
