{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a Replica Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Goldtop with Hard Case. This Replica is in good working condition. Fully tested. There is some static in the knobs from not being played. Also the selector switch has a little static when moving to different positions and it is missing the screw on cap. There is paint cracks in the body. There's 9 on the front and 6 on the back. These are from the age of the guitar. I think this is called crackling (crackled). The input jack plate is missing 2 screws and the control knob plate on the back is missing 2 screws. I can't seem to find any types of markings or numbers to be able to identify the maker or the year. I think the year is around the 60s to 70s. Any help on the year would be appreciated. Under the bridge it has ST Bridge marked, it looks like it was a casted piece. The body is made of double Plywood. The Neck and head seems to be made of 5 strips. This can be seen in good lighting at the right angle. The truss rod has an alan type head. The case is in Bad condition. 2 of the hinges are broken. The carpet is coming apart from the edges at the bottom. There's also what looks to be a burn hole from a cigarette in the top of the case. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.
