{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your consideration is a Custom Shop 2011 Figured Top Dot Vintage Sunburst ES 335 (model number: ESDPVSNH1) made in Nashville in February 2011 (SN 1041xxxx) in original Hard Shell Custom Shop case. The model and plant info were obtained from the internet. Warranty card and Certificate of Authenticity included. This guitar is in very good condition. Neck is right, action low, plays and looks beautiful. All pods in great shape without noise. I bought this guitar in 2015 from its original owner, a local Los Angeles musician. It was purchased out of midlife crisis. As one midlife crisis morphed into other pursuits, this guitar sat in my closet since day one and saw all but probably 3 hours of playtime \u2013 scales, chord progression, and regular polishing. As with any used gear it has some sign of use but all appear to be cosmetic and no damages whatsoever to the wood or anything that affect its play-ability. There are some light buckle lines on the back; pick guard has seen strumming but only visible from an angle; there is a tiny half-a-finger-nail size impression near one of the volume control (see last two photos). Overall it is very presentable and plays as it should. The case is in very good shape save one cosmetic tear that is half an inch. This is an as-is auction so please bid only if you are satisfied with the condition of the guitar as presented; background items such as guitar stand and records are not part of the auction. I am happy to answer any questions. Guitar will be properly packed.
