{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2006 Gibson Les Paul Junior Billie Joe Armstrong Signature in Ebony. All electronics are tested and properly working. This guitar features the original Gibson P90-H stacked pickup found on the early Billie Joe Armstrong signature models. This pickup is designed with two P90 coils stacked vertically such as to preserve the sound of an original P90, but cancel the hum generally found when using these pickups on higher volumes. The pots are the original Gibson branded ones and both work properly. No issues with the outpout jack. The hardware is all original, from the vintage style Gibson Kluson tuners and non-compensated wrap tailpiece, to even the strap buttons. The neck is a slimmer neck profile than a 50's neck, but not quite a slim-taper profile. The action is set up to be low, and the guitar overall plays perfectly at any volume. There are a few minor blemishes along the body and neck of the guitar. Near the top strap button, there appears to be a small area of worn finish. There are several small impressions by the output jack, and a small spot of worn finish on the first fret. None of these alter how the guitar plays in any-way. There are no major cracks, breaks, or repairs anywhere on the guitar. This item also includes the original leopard print hardshell case. Included in the case is the original pre-pack checklist card, warranty card, and TKL case lock instructions. The combination has been reset to 000. Ships only within the continuous US.
