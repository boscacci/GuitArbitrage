{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Antoniotsai\u201cPRS copy\u201d double Florentine features stunning bocote wood figuring. The body top and headstock are finished with Mexican bocote wood, an exotic and figured species. The rest of the structural wood appears to be nato or mahogany and maple. The body is a \u201csandwich\u201d construction with nato/bocote on the top, maple in the middle, and nato on the back (see photos). The maple neck has a scarf joint to protect against cracking or breaking. The headstock features an abalone \u201ceagle\u201d inlay and the maple fretboard has abalone \u201cbird\u201d marker inlays. Rear access plates and the truss rod cover appear to be hand-made. The guitar is equipped with a tusq nut, Korean goldtone humbucker pickups and tuning machines, and a goldtone Wilkinson tremolo bridge and arm. The electronics are PRS. It plays and sounds great, but is not perfect. The fretboard has many areas that appear to have varnish spots (see photo). There are minor cosmetic imperfections on the neck binding, left edge of the bocote shield, and a few very minor finish bumps and scrapes in general. The frets are virtually unused, but could use some finishing. The action is medium low, but the bridge height adjustment is at the lowest point, so some work may be needed to lower it further if the buyer wants even lower action. A snug Korean hard shell case in very good cosmetic and working condition is included. If shipping is less than $40, the difference will be refunded to the buyer. A full refund will be provided with no questions asked. I will return 100% of bid price + 50% of return shipping after the guitar is returned. Yes, this means the buyer takes a small risk (50% of return shipping) when bidding on this guitar. No partial refunds.", "ItemID": "323571410922", "EndTime": "2018-12-03T03:30:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-28T03:30:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Antoniotsai-bocote-DC-electric-guitar-/323571410922", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bridgeton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235714109228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1MVgxNjAw/z/soIAAOSwbKdb~U6c/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDUx/z/UJoAAOSwkERb~U6m/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIzNFgxNjAw/z/2h0AAOSwsupb~U6w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExOVgxNjAw/z/28IAAOSwfMlb~U6-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIyNVgxNjAw/z/tY0AAOSwmE9b~U7M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1NVgxNjAw/z/YDMAAOSwoDFb~U7X/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIzMFgxNjAw/z/6zQAAOSwPTlb~U7k/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE3NFgxNjAw/z/QZcAAOSwjt1b~U7u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4NFgxNjAw/z/6toAAOSwUxlb~U74/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI2MlgxNjAw/z/aiEAAOSw0~pb~U8G/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1NVgxNjAw/z/hWAAAOSwdzhb~U8S/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08302", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "orton0231", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1141, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 9, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 265.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 265.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***6", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1486}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Antoniotsai bocote DC electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Nato/maple/bocote"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Antoniotsai"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}]}, "HitCount": 204, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 270.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
