{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a 1995 Gibson Les Paul Standard in a beautiful shiny black with the original case. 1995 is a very sought after year for Gibson as this guitar is not chambered like the newer ones. They just don't make them the same anymore. This guitar is in good condition and in perfect working order. For being 24 years old, this guitar is in great shape. There are some light scratches, dings, and a little clear coat chip around the high \"e\" tuner. Overall, I would give it a solid 9 out of 10 condition. Everything on the guitar is original. There are no cracks, repairs, or issues. The neck is straight with no issues and plays great. The original frets are in excellent condition with no wear. The original case works great. SPECS: Nut Width: 1.67\" 1st Fret: 0.83\" 12th Fret: 0.97\" Neck Type: Slim Taper Finger Board: Rosewood Pickups: 490R and 498T Weight: 8lb 14oz If you scroll all the way down to the bottom of the pictures you can see detailed pictures of the frets, any wear on the guitar, and the guitar taken apart.
