{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "THIS IS THE LAST OFFERING OF MY COLLECTION!!!! Vintage Gibson Electric Guitar ES-330TD in Outstanding Condition. (As you can see in the photos, the serial number imprinted in the back of the head stalk (600016), and the list of serial numbers, show it in a range of 1966 to 1969. Check out the photo's of this guitar. It's nearly perfect with only 2 minor scuffs and minor chafing (Shown in the photos) for being 50+ years of age. Also original case which has the Gibson name somehow covered by what appears to be overspray of some sort. Sometime back a Bixby-7 hand vibrato was installed which was a great addition to the playability and effects. The original tail piece is still with the guitar and could easily be replaced if desired. The Gibson ES-330TD is well known as one of the finest Jazz/Blues/Rock and Roll guitars ever made due to its lightweight, versatility, tone and playability. Just check out info online and Utube has several demonstrations of its quality and sound. I hate to get rid of it but due to advancing age and since I no longer play, Im selling off most of my guitars. I SEE THAT SEVERAL ES-330TD'S ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH EBAY BUT THEY ALL SEEM TO BE IN JAPAN AND ARE ASKING QUITE A BIT MORE THAN MY STARTING BID PRICE. (THIS IS A CENTRAL COAST OF CALIFORNIA GUITAR AND HAS BEEN IN MY COLLECTION FOR OVER 25 YEARS) *GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND I HOPE WHO EVER ENDS UP WITH THIS FINE INSTRUMENT LOVES IT AS MUCH AS I HAVE. ITS TIME TO FIND IT A GOOD HOME *", "ItemID": "192815489607", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T15:10:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-05T07:40:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Electric-Guitar-ES-330TD-1968-Condition-/192815489607", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Luis Obispo, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1928154896078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-zEAAOSwQM1cSiIz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OhUAAOSwl1FcSiIu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4OsAAOSwUVFcSiQX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X3QAAOSwRL1cSiQX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/u10AAOSw3K1cSiQZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fGkAAOSwopxcSiQZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IToAAOSwN5hcSiQX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aQ8AAOSwPVFcSiQX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aiUAAOSw1IhcSiYY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/frMAAOSwHSdcT0Pf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2s0AAOSwQLVcSiXX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pvIAAOSw5tNcSiXX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "93401", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "h*rider", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 152, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 328}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Electric Guitar, ES-330TD 1968 +++ Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1968"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-330TD"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "California Prop 65 Warning", "Value": ["N/A"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Bixby 7 added"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["N/A"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow Double Cutaway"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["5084951"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 22, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
