{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "***THERE IS ONLY ONE SINGLE CONSIDERABLE DEFECT AND IT IS MENTIONED BELOW HERE*** The string tightening knobs on this model are quite unique, and on the back side there is this little winding, housing unit that contain the mechanics for tightening/loosening the strings. The housing for the \"D String\" has somehow come undone, and wants to pop out of the back. I have no idea how to fix this, I have no desire to figure it out, but it works as long as you hold it together in order to tighten/loosen the string. See photos for details, and keep in mind while you consider a bid/offer. ***DEFECT MENTIONED ABOVE HERE*** I'm not an expert when it comes to guitars. I have played guitar for about 15 years now, though the specifics of type of wood or getting down to really the nitty-gritty details of these things is something I really have no idea about nor do I really care about considering I don't really have the finances to be able to have the privilege of preference when it comes to these things. I just play it, and if it feel good, then it feels good. This one just didn't feel good for me, but that's not to say there's anything wrong with it by any means! This thing has action that's as smooth as butter! The downside of that is that there is major free buzz, but that's likely because I play in very low tunings and this guitar + these strings are NOT meant for that. But as I said earlier, I really have no idea, so please keep any technical questions about the guitar to a minimum because I'll just be outright honest: I'm not going to have the answer unless it's something basic like \"how many strings does it have\" or something else very obvious about it. Other than that, you'll be able to find any and all information out about the guitar by looking it up elsewhere and making the decision if the specifications are right for you and then feel absolutely free to make a bid/offer! Thank you! With your purchase will include a full body, hard cover travel/roadie case! (This is included as a gift, and should not be expected, which is why I am choosing not to include photos of it. Just know that you will have a matching case as an added gift after the purchase!)", "ItemID": "254014495056", "EndTime": "2018-12-07T12:36:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-06T12:36:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-SG-Standard-Black-Electric-Guitar-NICE-/254014495056", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Puyallup, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540144950568080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3OFg1NDQ=/z/SKIAAOSwKphcCObf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgxMDgw/z/evAAAOSwC45cCOcE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgxMDgw/z/MxgAAOSw0YlcCOg7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFg2NjU=/z/be8AAOSwiwZcCOhX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI1N1g3OTM=/z/ALgAAOSwdxVcCOhu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgxMDgw/z/09EAAOSwQXlcCOiO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgxMDgw/z/Ye8AAOSworNcCOi8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98374", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "1-dollar-auction", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 40, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.6}, "BidCount": 35, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 515.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 515.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 368}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson SG Standard - Black - Electric Guitar - *NICE*", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2011"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}]}, "HitCount": 449, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Has been elegantly handled for many years to retain such a fine condition!
