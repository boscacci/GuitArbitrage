{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Find more pics here: CLICK for 20+ DETAILED PICS! Beautiful and great condition SA700 Walnut Type.Made in Japan on 1978, one of the best condition Ive ever seen for the old age guitar. I have taken many detailed pics, so please go see them all. The sound is good, electronics work well. The frets are about 70% with no fret bumpy. Currently set in minimum low action, so request you to customize based on your preference. Some small chips and scratches, but nothing damage the overall appearance. The screws especially for the pickguard and pickup case are rusty due to old, and one screw for the pickguard has been broken as you can see in the pics, but as of now no negative impact to the playability as the pickguard is firm supported by another screw in the downside. All parts are original including the Greco Pickups, but Im not sure on the pickup cases and the bridge as they are so clean for the age. They may original though, but I think this wont a big deal, at least for me. The neck is straight, and I have never touched the truss-rod since purchased as used. The hardshell case in the pics is included as well, great case. \u25c6 Shipping and Packaging CONCERN ABOUT THE GUITAR SAFETY???? I have sent many guitars outside and never had a problem. My packaging is very very safe!! Better than any of Japanese sellers here in ebay! You can trust that!! Check the pic below!! I pack very carefully and full with bubble wrap outside. I use EMS service for shipping methods. It`s the most safe and quickly way of shipping from Japan and only takes 2 to 5 days from Japan to USA,CANADA,3 to 7 days to Asia, Australia and Europe. The rate is $130 to everywhere!! Actually it will be around 160 to 180 I have to pay, but it is OK. Just pay $130!! And PLEASE DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT SHIPPING CHARGE, AS THAT IS HOW MUCH IT REALLY COSTS(or more) DUE TO VERY HEAVY WEIGHT AS SOME OTHER SELLER EVEN COST MORE FROM JAPAN. BESIDES THE VERY EXPENSIVE EBAY FINAL VALUE FEE & PAYPAL FEE\u2019S, EBAY NOW CHARGES FINAL VALUE FEE ON SHIPPING CHARGE TOO. THE SHIPPING COST IS WRITTEN CLEARLY ON THE EMS ADDRESS LABEL IN JAPANESE YEN, SO THE BUYER WILL SEE THE ACTUAL COST OF SHIPPING.I DO NOT MAKE PROFIT OF SHIPPING!!! IMPORTANT NOTE: 1.
