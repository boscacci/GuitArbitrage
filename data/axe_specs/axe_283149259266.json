{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello Everyone, This LP started life as a 2012 Gibson Les Paul Classic Custom....mahogany body, maple cap, mahogany neck, baked maple fretboard (love these) and the split diamond inlay on the headstock...only available from 2011 to 2012. She weighs in around 9 pounds 9 ounces...well balanced. Swapped out the speed knob for reflector knobs, installed 57 classic plus in the bridge (came with 57 classic in the neck) and upgraded potentiometers to CTS and caps to orange drop spragues (like Slash) and wired 50's style. The neck is on the thin side and reminds me of my Jackson Soloist. So...I was installing the pickup ring on the the 57 Classic pickup...beautiful mirror like finish on the pickup cover...AND...the screwdriver slipped and ran across the pickup cover...I swear...they put those slotted screws and stiff springs on the covered pickups on purpose...your chance of scratching the cover go up like 99.9% versus if they just put a phillips screw that can actually be adjusted with your truss rod tool...anywhose...So being aggravated, I pulled the pickups and hardware and just rubbed a scotch brite lightly on them...instant aged LP!...hahahahaha. Actually the look goes well with the guitar. I think the hardware would look great to now buff it out a little to get some shine along with the worn look...I already took the pictures, so I don't want to change anything at this point. This LP has been \"loved on\"...a little worming around in the back...surface marks front and back (can see these when in really bright lights)...she's been played and is starting to take on a bit of a worn look; HOWEVER, the frets are in excellent shape. Your job would be to continue playing her and only add to her personality. She does play and sound awesomely good. I already have 57's so I wanted this LP to have just a little more \"bite\" than my other LPs....the 57 Classic Plus does this. With the upgraded low friction pots, Spragues and 50's style wiring this LP is EXTREMELY versatile...the volume knob turns into an overdrive knob. I put Kluson pointers on the reflector knobs because you can actually hear a difference between 6 and 8...3 and 5...etc. There are lots of sounds to explore with this LP and I wanted this to be a gigging LP. I didn't want anyone to worry about the finish and I wanted an LP that sounds great, plays great and and can be used for a variety of music and no need to switch guitars between songs/sets. Hmmm....I think that's about it? I hope whoever gets this LP will be totally stoked...cool guitar...plays and sounds GREAT. I will be shipping her Fedex Ground insured in the continental United States. She comes with the original hard shell case and everything you see in the pictures. If anyone has any questions, please let me know. Regards : )Rob P.S.
