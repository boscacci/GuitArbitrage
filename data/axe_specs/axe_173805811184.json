{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1997 Fender Squier Stratocaster made In Korea in very good condition. This stratocaster is in a rare dark blue (not black), hopefully the blue shows in the photos. It was made in Korea in 1997 with the serial number KV97071196. This is a very solid and heavy stratocaster which has just had a TUSQ nut installed - all that needs to be done by the buyer is a setup if needed. The condition of the rosewood and the frets lead one to assume that this guitar was never really played. There are a few nicks on the body of the guitar due to its age - 22 years. The neck is in excellent condition. Comes with a gig bag. Due to costs I am only able to ship to the 48 lower states.", "ItemID": "173805811184", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T10:15:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-21T18:06:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Fender-Squier-Stratocaster-Dark-Blue-made-Korea-/173805811184", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Naples, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1738058111848080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Dh4AAOSwl1lcWI3G/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GvsAAOSwc6ZcWI3Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-agAAOSwLKhcWI3v/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SzIAAOSw6jJcWI4Q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sfoAAOSwm5xcWI4f/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LK4AAOSwsZhcWI4y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WvMAAOSwxDJcWI4-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3DIAAOSw~xtcWI5K/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ki4AAOSwGBRcWI5b/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LukAAOSwXI1cWI5u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FH4AAOSw93xcWI6F/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34105", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sebastian0292012", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 152, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.7}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 105.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 105.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 535}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Fender Squier Stratocaster Dark Blue  -   made In Korea", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 143, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 107.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
