{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ibanez Artist AM-50 Electric Guitar ES335 style, vintage, classic, rare. Condition is Used. Tobacco sunburst, 1985, made in Japan. Pickups are GFS Fat PAT humbuckers and the harness is also GFS. Guitar is used and has some minor dings here and there I couldn't get into the photos but overall is in good to very good condition. One pickup ring has a small crack but works (see pictures). I purchased it used in the early 1990's, the previous owner had a pickguard on it then removed it, you can see a small dot on the front where the pickguard had been sitting. The current pickups are modeled after traditional PAF humbuckers and are medium output. They give the guitar a vintage sound, a bit jangly, reminds me of ginger-ale when played clean. You can hear demos of the pickups in a different body at GuitarFetish. Includes a gig bag, but the bag was for a classical style guitar and is in poor condition - it has several small cuts from the guitar strings at the tuners from being put into the bag. This is great rare electric guitar you seldom see at this price. I have listed lower than its worth due to the non-original pickups and harness, but its a fantastic guitar. I'm selling it as I only play on my small scale instruments now and this beautiful guitar is just crying for a new spot light. Please ask questions before bidding, sold as is. Q:A - I do not have the original pickups, it came with other pickups. What you see in the auction is what is included. Q:A - I chose the GFS because it was quick and cheap (the harness is the \"Kwikplug Standard\"), I decided anybody who would want the guitar probably has a special set of humbuckers they want in it, magical camel hair wire, NOS gypsy oil cans, and mojo max mystical tone pots... so go crazy and make it your own!", "ItemID": "292962515358", "EndTime": "2019-02-24T19:00:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-14T19:00:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Artist-AM-50-Electric-Guitar-ES335-vintage-rare-made-Japan-/292962515358", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Prescott, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929625153588080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzEwWDEwMDA=/z/0kkAAOSwlKVcZcX1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDYxWDEwMDA=/z/GfQAAOSwBmJcZcX1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY3WDEwMDA=/z/41wAAOSwwStcZcX0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NjE=/z/NsAAAOSw9ClcZcX1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjI3WDEwMDA=/z/u5oAAOSwLi1cZbnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY3WDEwMDA=/z/h6QAAOSw9ZtcZbnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTM5WDEwMDA=/z/oCsAAOSw6nhcZbnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "86305", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "trematode", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 654, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 239}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez Artist AM-50 Electric Guitar ES335, vintage, rare made in Japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 470, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
