Notes: In the early 70's Ibanez set out to make high-precision replicas of Gibson's top-end instruments. So successful were they that Gibson sued to stop production, which was subsequently halted under court order. Now known as 'lawsuit' models, these guitars have become legendary for their rarity, and their scrupulous faithfulness to the originals. Meticulously constructed, this guitar, model 2461NT, is virtually identical in dimensions, scale and bracing to its Gibson namesake. The solid ebony fingerboard is inlaid with pearl split block inlays, and the body shows particularly handsome bookmatched tiger flame in the back and sides. Fitted with all original gold hardware, the guitar has the rare twin floating mini-humbucking pickups, with 3 way rotary pickup selector and independent volume and tone controls. This instrument has a comfortable modern neck profile and is an all-time favorite of working pros,who prefer to leave their spendy originals at home.
