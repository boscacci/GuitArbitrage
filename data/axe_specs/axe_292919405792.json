Epiphone - Casino This is an Epiphone Casino in VERY GOOD condition. This guitar does not include a case and has no pick guard. The guitar's body is in good shape, on the back of the neck it does have one indent as posted on the gallery. Any Beatles fans out there: this is a must have guitar! The Epiphone Casino is a thin-line, hollow-body archtop is constructed with the traditional laminated Maple top, back and sides and a solid Mahogany neck giving it it's classic tone brilliantly amplified by a pair of authentic Epiphone \"Dog Ear\" P-90 Classic pickups. Together, they combine to create the sparkling tone that became the iconic sound of the Beatles, as it is easily recognized for, but that is also heard in classic hits from the Rolling Stones and the Kinks and in modern performances from bands like U2. Other features include body and fingerboard binding around the Rosewood fretboard and distinctive parallelogram inlays, a white pickguard bearing the iconic Epiphone \u201cE\u201d logo and vintage-style Epiphone tuning machines. Controls include full 1\u201d 500K potentiometers controlling bridge pickup volume and tone and neck pickup volume and tone as well as Epiphone\u2019s quality all-metal toggle switch and a premium output jack. -AM IF YOU BUY IT AND YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WE HAVE THE 30 DAY MONEY BACK RETURN POLICY READ BELOW - THANK YOU SOLD AS USED AND AS IS ,BUT YOU DO HAVE 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF DELIVERY TO CONTACT US FOR A REFUND IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY : Buyer is responsible for shipping charges back to us.
