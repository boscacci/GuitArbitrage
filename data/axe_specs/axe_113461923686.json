{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a 1989 Carvin V220 Electric Guitar. Black with gold hardware. Serial # is 25497, which puts the guitar in the 1988-1990 time period, but mostly likely 1989. If you know these guitars, then you will immediately notice two things that make this guitar different from the standard V220. The first is that it is a hardtail version without the tremolo bridge. The second is that there is a third switch that is a phase switch. The guitar also has a coil split switch for each humbucker pickup. So humbuckers, coil taps and a phase switch combine to really give this guitar quite a variety of sounds. The pickups are stock Carvin M22 pickups, M22N in the neck (7.3 ohm) and M22SD in the bridge (11.17 ohm). This guitar is all original with the exception of the low E tuner which has been replaced with a similar Carvin tuner (screw placement is different). The bridge and tailpiece may not be original, but I am not really sure. The case appears to be original, but it does not have the Carvin logo on it (also missing one foot on the bottom flat side). This guitar plays and sounds outstanding as you would expect from a Carvin. Nice Ebony fretboard. This is a guitar that has been played and there is some fret wear in the form of string indentations, but nothing too serious. There is a slight string buzz on the lower three strings in the open position, but of course you can really only hear this when playing unplugged. No other buzzing or fret out. The action on the low E at the 12th fret is only 1 mm, so I am pretty sure a good set up would be essential to really dialing this guitar in. Some very minor scratchiness to the neck volume and tone pot, but probably just needs to be cleaned. The guitar, of course, has some dings, scratches and belt buckle rash as should be expected. The worst paint loss being on the bottom of the longest lower horn. So that sounds like a lot, but I am really just nit-picking this guitar so there are no surprises. Otherwise it is a really nice looking and playing guitar with just some minor issues. If you are looking for an 80's shred machine, this is it. These are great guitars that don't come out for sale too often. I have done my best to describe this guitar, but please view the pictures and use the zoom feature to determine condition and characteristics for yourself.
