Crafted in the image of the most revered version of this model from the early \u201970s, the Les Paul Deluxe newly recreated by Gibson USA offers all the ingredients that helped this instrument stand out from the crowd, including traditional tonewoods and electronics, superb playability and first-class Gibson craftsmanship. And it's all wrapped in a high-gloss Goldtop nitrocellulose finish to give it the look of the best-loved rendition of the Deluxes of old.\u00a0To set a firm foundation for tone, Gibson USA crafts the Les Paul Deluxe with the same tonewoods used in the most beloved example of the model from the 1970s. A carved maple top is glued to a Grade-A mahogany body that is strategically chambered to both enhance tone and reduce weight. A Grade-A quarter-sawn mahogany neck is carved to a comfortably rounded profile that measures .818\" deep at the 1st fret and .963\" at the 12th. It is capped with a premium katalox fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets and a radius of 12\" for easy choke-free bending. Cream plastic binding provides a smooth feel and a classic look. To anchor it all down there's a Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece\u2014two innovative classics of Gibson hardware\u2014and a set of vintage-look Tone Pros tuners with efficient 16:1 gear ratios.\u00a0All the ringing resonance and sustain wrought by these ingredients are transmitted to the amp with optimum depth and clarity by a pair of Gibson's legendary mini-humbucking pickups. The Les Paul Deluxe mini-humbuckers are made much like full-sized PAF-style humbuckers with genuine Alnico II magnets but with narrower coils and slightly fewer turns of wire for a sharper, more focused sound. They are perfect for cutting through a heavy band mix, while also going confidently into twangy and jangly genres that Les Pauls aren\u2019t usually thought to excel at, without sacrificing any of the depth and muscle that makes a great Les Paul what it is. Routed through the traditional complement of two independent volume controls and two independent tone controls and three-way toggle switch\u2014and a great locking Neutrick\u00ae output jack for total plugged-in security\u2014these pickups provide stunning tonal versatility. Put it all together\u2014along with the gold Speed Knobs, \"Deluxe\" engraved truss-rod cover and LP Deluxe pickguard\u2014all marks of the breed\u2014and you've got an evocative recreation of a model that helped make today\u2019s rock what it is.\u00a0 FEATURES:- Grade-A Mahogany body with carved Grade-A Maple top- Fast, comfortable 50's-style neck profile- Bound Katalox fingerboard with acrylic trapezoid inlays- Pair of Lollar pickups in the neck and bridge- Tone Pros keystone tuners with 16:1 tuning ratio SPECIFICATIONS: Body Top : Maple Back : Mahogany Binding : Cream Body Type : Chambered Adhesive : Franklin Titebond 50 Neck Species : Mahogany Profile : 50's-Style Truss Rod : Traditional Adjustable Joint Angle : 5\u00b0 (+/- 15 seconds) Adhesive : Franklin Titebond 50 Joint : Mortise & Tenon Adhesive : Franklin Titebond 50 Joint Angle Tolerance : +/- .005\" Fingerboard Species : Katalox Frets : 22 Radius : 12\" Nut/E.O.B : 1.695\"/2.260\" Binding : Cream Inlays : Acrylic Trapezoid Nut Material : Corian Width : 1.695 Slots : Gibson PLEK System Logo : Mother of Pearl \"Gibson\" Logo with Gold Scripted \"Les Paul Model\" Silkscreen Truss Rod Cover : Black and White Antique Bell with \"Deluxe\" engraved Tuners Model : Tone Pros Keystone Vintage tuners Plating : Chrome Tuning Ratio : 16:1 Bridge Type : Tune-O-Matic Material : Zamak Plating : Chrome Tailpiece Type : Bigsby B5 wit Vibramate V5 Mounting Kit Material : Aluminium Plating : Chrome Knobs : Gold Speed Knobs Top Hat Style Toggle Switch Washer : Cream with Gold Imprint Pickguard : Cream Les Paul Deluxe Control Plate Cover : Black Plastic Strap Buttons : Aluminum Neck Position : Lollar P-90 Staple Bridge Position : Lollar P-90 Soapbar Overwound Electronics : Emerson Custom Kit Toggle Switch : Three-way Switchcraft with Cream Plastic Tip Output Jack : Neutrick Jack Sealer : Nitrocellulose Surface : Texture High Gloss Process : 1-1.5 mils Case Type : Gibson Hardshell Case Exterior : Black Case Interior : White Plush Weight : 8.8 lbs / 4.4 kg All our items are fully verified by our pro technician and/or adjusted by our pro luthier before being very carefully packed by our pro service team here at the shop prior to shipment, buy with confidence! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Canadian customers must pay any applicable sales taxes.
