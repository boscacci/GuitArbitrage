{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "My husband, Gary Stroup, a luthier, passed away recently. He made handcarved archtop guitars but also loved many others. He played a Fender Jaguar in his country western dance band and was so impressed in recent years with the quality of the inexpensive guitars which made it possible for everyone to have one. As a kid, he couldn\u2019t afford one, so during his career he gave many guitars to young people that wanted to learn. He never owned a Gibson Les Paul guitar but was very impressed with this Epiphone Les Paul Special. Collecting guitars became a hobby for him. Molded case is included that is made for this guitar. Guitar is in mint condition and was played very little.
