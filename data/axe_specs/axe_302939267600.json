{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I bought this guitar used about 3 years ago. It's the American Made Legacy, not the overseas Tribute model. Neck pocket date is October, 1997. Lake Placid Blue finish is in excellent condition, no really visible flaws to speak of. All electronics function as designed. Includes original hard case, the handle for the case has been replaced with a strap that works well. Factory specs state that this is an Alder body. Sorry for the poor cell phone pics, best my cheap phone will do.The guitar sounds and plays great, I've had absolutely no issues with it however, in the interest of full disclosure I would like to state the following:Action is low with 10's, frets could use a dressing job but are playable as is, with decent mileage still left. My local repair guy does this work for about $100.There is a crack in the body near where tremolo mounting screw is, I took the pickguard assembly off to get a photo. It is not visible with the guard on or through the rear trem rout. I was told by the G&L factory repair shop that this is common in the older models, due to a design flaw which was corrected in later models. This occurred before I bought the guitar, it had been professionally repaired by the luthier at the shop I bought it from. I have had absolutely no related issues whatsoever, even when hitting the trem bar fairly hard. The epoxy repair is probably stronger than the overall body wood. I've played Strat like guitars for years and do not notice any difference in tone or sustain.
