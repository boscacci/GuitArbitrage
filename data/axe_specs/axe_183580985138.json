Not much of the guitars previous history is known, it has come out for sale recently and I have plugged in, played and tested the instrument. Overall this guitar plays properly with the electronics working well, no apparent issues. Since this guitar hasn't seen much recent use you may want to adjust the action since it is quite high but this instrument is certainly playable as it comes. Cosmetically the Schecter is in pretty decent shape with some normal signs of wear like surface marks, scratches, some nicks on the edges but overall it looks solid. This instrument comes as it is shown in the attached photos.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
