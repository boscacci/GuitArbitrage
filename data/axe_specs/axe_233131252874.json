{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2013 Fender Road Worn 50s Telecaster. Fantastic shape, plays incredibly. The relic job looks legitimate, not overdone like some I've seen. The necks on the Road Worn series have the finish removed by Fender, so they are susceptible to humidity changes! The skunk stripe expands and contracts at a different rate than the maple of the fretboard and neck, so when it's dry, like during the winter, they tend to stick out a bit. This neck is no different! Please do not buy this guitar if you don't understand that phenomenon, it's a very well documented quirk of these guitars. Rock solid tuners and bridge. Includes Road Runner gig bag, can add case for extra $75. I am a hobbyist guitar player, not a store, so I cannot accept returns. Please ask any questions prior to committing to buy. I ship all of my guitars fully insured via FedEx and professionally packed. AGED TO PERFECTIONThose who prize older instruments with the battered look of years on the road and the scars of countless gigs can still have that authentically aged vibe without spending decades on the road themselves. The irresistibly cool look of finish worn through to the wood, rusted hardware, a bruised neck and yellowing plastic parts are yours right away with Road Worn instruments.The Road Worn '50s Telecaster sounds, looks and feels like it's been there and back, has more than a few miles on it, and then some. With authentic 1950s styling aged to impart a lifetime of wear and tear that has somehow made it get even better, it's a must-have for the guitar player who appreciates broken-in look and vibe.FEATURES1950s style with aged/worn body, neck, finish and hardware touchesMaple neck with \u201cC\u201d profile7.25\u201d-radius maple fingerboard with 21 narrow jumbo fretsDual Tex-Mex\u2122 single-coil pickups with three-way switchingVintage-style string-through-body Telecaster bridge with three chrome \u201cbarrel\u201d saddlesWorn nitrocellulose-lacquer finish", "ItemID": "233131252874", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T19:22:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-12T19:22:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Road-Worn-50s-Telecaster-Electric-Guitar-/233131252874", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Madison, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331312528748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PJcAAOSw~9JcXJCv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IaUAAOSwElhcXJCw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NiIAAOSwE1tcXJCw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cJcAAOSwWKpcXJCx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UTEAAOSw~gZcXJCv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c2cAAOSwALdcXJCv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GGEAAOSwLWJcXJDA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RA4AAOSwYkRcXJCw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUxN1g2Njk=/z/300AAOSwIS9cOrZ0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MzE=/z/jiQAAOSwAThcOraA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53719", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tgbrass", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 902, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 535.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 535.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 481}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Road Worn 50s Telecaster Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Ash"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["131212303"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Road Worn"]}]}, "HitCount": 807, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 545.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78587794", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
