PRS Modern Eagle ME1 2004 10 Top Red Tiger Flame + OHSC Lovies Guitars is offering up a gorgeous PRS Modern Eagle in an awesome Red Tiger Flame 10 Top finish! This particular is what\u2019s known as a Modern Eagle 1, and one amazing thing about this guitar is the Brazilian Rosewood neck, headstock and fretboard! These guitars are highly sought after and the moment I picked it up i immediately understood why, it has such a rich and beautiful tone that only the masters PRS could achieve! The Modern Eagle has one of the most amazing necks I\u2019ve ever played on, it really just makes you wanna get carried away by the sweet tunes! It has two small dings near the tone knob and switch, a little bit of worming near the pickups from a pick and a couple small dents along the edge on the body groove on the back. No breaks, cracks or repairs! SEE many HD images included!
