{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar has a scalloped fingerboard. I used it to practice playing with a light touch. If you can master the light touch, you can fly on this thing. When I bought it, it was listed as a Fender Custom shop guitar. I make no guarantee that it really is from the custom shop. Maybe it is; maybe it isn't. In fact, it might even have been assembled from various parts. I have no way of knowing for sure. The fingerboard is a beautiful figured maple. Since I don't really know the background, I am offering this at a great price. Someone can get an awesome (possibly Custom Shop) guitar at a bargain. It does play and sound great. The pickups are Fender's N3 models. They are great. I took this guitar to my luthier and he did some work on the frets. It plays like butter. There is no case, but it will be well packed.Continental US shipping only.", "ItemID": "173697556967", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T15:35:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T15:35:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-Scalloped-Fingerboard-/173697556967", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Akron, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736975569678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7DAAAOSw0EpcC9WH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EfoAAOSwYXpcC9WK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MEQAAOSw5iRcC9WM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-A4AAOSwUqVcC9WP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oFUAAOSwpYxcC9WR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3SQAAOSwRfxcC9WU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hWkAAOSwEHhcC9WW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KLQAAOSwyApcC9WZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KJwAAOSw1uVcC9Wb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JL0AAOSwFAtcC9Wd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SCkAAOSwJ3RcC9Wg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xtwAAOSwLeFcC9kD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44333", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wbaginski55", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 581, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 454}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster Scalloped Fingerboard", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}]}, "HitCount": 228, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 460.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good condition.
