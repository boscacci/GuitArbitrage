{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Squier Stratocaster Electric Guitar Red Professionally Set Up! You are viewing a used Squier Stratocaster in red finish. It features a maple neck and fretboard, three single coil pickups, a five-way pickup selector, tremolo bridge, and chrome hardware. Finish has a few scratches and blemishes from normal use, please see our pictures for best view of cosmetic condition. It has been professionally setup in our shop (see video below) and comes ready to play.\u00a0 The big difference on our guitars compared to other sellers is that we hand-adjust & check over each guitar including neck & action adjustments and more (see our video) to ensure the guitar will play easily when you receive it! The set up we do makes a HUGE difference. Most private sellers and many other sellers generally do not do this level of setup to a used guitar as we do. We feel every guitar should be ready to play well when you receive it. The instrument pictured is the one you will receive. We use our own photos to ensure that you have a full view of the exact instrument you are purchasing. A case or a bag is available for an additional fee. Please contact us if you\u2019re interested. PERRY'S PROFESSIONAL SETUP:This guitar has been professionally setup to play great!Guitars do not generally come from the factory setup, so this is a huge benefit for all players from beginning to professional, and in our opinion a must have! No professional player would use a guitar that hasn't been setup, nor should you!We normally charge $75 for this service, but for you this is a FREE BONUS included with every guitar we sell online!This includes truss rod adjustment, fret dressing, nut and saddle adjustment, and much more.**CLICK HERE FOR VIDEO** Listing and template services provided by inkFrog", "ItemID": "163505781025", "EndTime": "2019-01-27T16:45:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T00:45:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squier-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar-Red-Professionally-Set-Up-/163505781025", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Villa Park, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635057810258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkxWDEwNzk=/z/ILsAAOSw-GNcS63B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkzWDkzMA==/z/TrsAAOSw55FcS63B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njk3WDkyNQ==/z/NhUAAOSwEqVcS63B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60181", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "perrysmusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1759, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 145.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 145.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1432}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squier Stratocaster Electric Guitar Red Professionally Set Up!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["885978349692"]}]}, "HitCount": 37, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=13975612", "StoreName": "Perry&#39;s Music"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "SKU": "IF_C3861279", "NewBestOffer": false}
