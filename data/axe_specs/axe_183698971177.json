{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "USED EPIPHONE CASINO LIMITED EDITION JOHN LENNON REVOLUTION 1965 ELECTRIC GUITAR WITH CASE The John Lennon \"1965\" Casino is a faithful reproduction of John's beloved Vintage Sunburst Casino as he purchased it in 1966. In 1968, Lennon decided to \"strip\" the finish off his Casino. The John Lennon \"Revolution\" Casino is a faithful reproduction of his Casino with a \"stripped\" natural finish as it was then and as it remains today.This Guitar is in very good condition showing some signs and wear which include the following: Slight dulling of metal hardware & tuners, a few slight marks and dings located throughout (not entirely sure which is from use or which is stock as it is a reproduction) frets are in very good condition showing very minor indentation on the first fret but still have plenty of life left. The headstock was repaired previously by an unknown luthier, the repair was inspected and appears to be stable. However, because of this we are selling the instrument \"as is\" and returns will not be accepted (some exemptions may apply) The repair can be seen in photos above.This instrument includes the original case, pick guard, certificate of authenticity, JL bag, and original warranty card. The only item that is missing is the gold volume knob for the volume of the neck pickup (this limited edition came with one gold and one black tone knob as John Lennon had used a black knob on his). The case is in good condition showing some very minor fabric degradation as well as a couple scrapes located on the top as seen in photos above.Production Number: 1506 of 1965SPECS:Model: CasinoOriginal Body Shape - Mid '60's Kalamazoo, Michigan tooling specsBody Materials - 5-layer (Maple/Birch/Maple/Birch/Maple)Top Contour Bracing - Spruce with original relief spacing and depthOne-piece Mahogany neck with 14 degree grain orientation (Repaired - See Description)Rosewood fingerboard with .062\" thick pearloid, parallelogram fret markersOriginal Fingerboard support spacer height, .071\"Neck shape (elliptical - Neck joint at 16th fret)Neck binding covers fret-endsScale - 24.750\"Original Nut material \"Corian\" - 1.62\" widthHeadstock Logo, mother of pearl - inlay thickness, .062\"Larger original style headstock - 17 degree pitch\"Gibson-Factory\" electronicsNickel-Plated, dog-eared P-90 Pickup Covers with original pole spacingSwitchcraft, 3-way toggle with old style black washerNickel ABR Bridge with nylon saddlesNickel Gibson-Factory HardwareVintage style case with shroudStamped with John's original serial numberAssembled in U.S.AWhite Pickguard IncludedOriginal Hardshell Case IncludedCertificate of Authenticity Included We will do our best to make this the BEST eBay experience for you!
