{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered for sale; Used 1999 Fender Stratocaster \u201850s Reissue Crossroads serial number MN9384335. This guitar is in excellent condition, neck and frets are fine, cosmetically quite clean. The pickups have been upgraded to Fender Noiseless and a guitar skin has been applied. The skin is a tribute to \u201cCrash 1\u201d, a guitar used by Eric Clapton in one of his \u201cCrossroads Festivals\u201d. The skin is not an exact replication but a rendition. About that artwork: \u201cIn 1997, Eric Clapton met street artist John \"Crash\" Matos and was inspired by his artwork, a mix of abstract and graffiti-based street-art. Eric had \"Crash\" paint one of his unfinished Stratocaster bodies in 2000 and \"CRASH 1\" (also known as the \"Over the Rainbow\" Stratocaster) was born and has become one of the most iconic Stratocasters of all time...\u201d The guitar itself is a reissue '50s Stratocaster built in 1999 and was one of the first Mexican made vintage reissues, after production shifted from Japan. It features an alder body, soft V maple neck with 7.25\" radius, 21 vintage style frets, vintage style tuners, synchronized tremolo, and aged plastic parts. This is a nice playing and sweet-sounding Strat that is in beautiful shape and visually quite stunning. Hard-shell case included. \u201cWe carefully inspect every instrument when we buy it and bring it up to our standards before we offer it for sale. We also do a full set up before we ship. If you decide to purchase this guitar, please let us know what gauge strings you prefer.\u201d FEATURES Alder body (polyester finish) Maple soft V-shaped neck (gloss urethane finish) 25-1/2\" scale length Maple fingerboard 7.25\" radius 21 vintage-style frets 1 5/8\u201d nut width Three Fender Noiseless single coil pickups 5-position pickup switch Vintage-style synchronized tremolo Master volume, neck pickup tone control, middle pickup tone control Fender Ping vintage-style tuners Chrome hardware Aged knobs and switch tip Synthetic bone nut Weight 7.8 lbs. *Please note: we do our best giving descriptions of used pieces. We have found it impossible to describe every mark on an instrument or amp that is not in the \"mint\" category. Also, what's important to you may not be important to someone else. For example, you may say, \"I don't care what it looks like as long as it plays or sounds well.\" Another person may say, \"Body cosmetics are very important to me so tell me about every scratch, nick and blemish.\" So, please ask the questions that are most important to you. If you ask, they will be answered. They are free and there's no limit. Additional photos can also be made available. This is a specific item that is also being offered for sale in our brick & mortar location. It is possible that it has just been sold. Please ask if it is still available before purchasing. *It is our policy to require a signature on delivery of all musical instruments. Please let us know if you prefer no signature required when ordering or we will automatically require a signature. If you prefer your item to be sent without a required signature Imperial Guitar and the selected carrier can no longer be responsible for the security of the package once it has been delivered.", "ItemID": "283263780123", "EndTime": "2019-01-15T15:23:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-16T19:50:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-50s-Reissue-Crossroads-1999-/283263780123", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "New Paltz, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832637801238080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg1MDE=/z/ZHsAAOSwpwBb7x67/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg0Nzg=/z/RncAAOSwA29b7x7F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgzMDA=/z/1WQAAOSwkHxb7x7L/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgyOTk=/z/bz4AAOSwg8xb7x7R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg5MjQ=/z/rQ4AAOSwqIhb7x7Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg5MTM=/z/xKQAAOSwAQVb7x7g/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg4MTQ=/z/DFwAAOSwctJb7x7u/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg3NDc=/z/VM8AAOSwHnJb7x72/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg1NTQ=/z/XG4AAOSw5tNb7x79/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFg2Mzg=/z/Zi4AAOSw0TBb7x8G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjM3WDE0NDA=/z/hQ4AAOSwFZZb7x8N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE0WDE0NDA=/z/zCsAAOSwBqZb7x8W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "12561", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "imperialguitar", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 264, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 93.8}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 725.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 725.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 476}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster \u201850s Reissue Crossroads 1999", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Surf Green"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster  \u201850s  Reissue Crossroads"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}]}, "HitCount": 253, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=16062828", "StoreName": "imperialguitar"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used in excellent condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
