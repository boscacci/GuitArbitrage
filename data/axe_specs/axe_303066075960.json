{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Peavey Tragic 1 PXD (Peavey EXtreme Design) electric guitar. Excellent condition and comes in a matching \"coffin\" padded gig bag. This guitar is a B stock item, meaning that it is refurbished. It is stamped \"USED\" on the back of the head stock and the serial number is printed on a sticker as is done on refurbished guitars. I purchased it new a few years ago, and the only thing I can find wrong is some scratches and scarring on the edge of one of the horns on the head stock. It cannot be seen from the front or back of the guitar, only from the side of the head stock. It does not effect the play-ability of this guitar. Last pic is of that area. This guitar looks and plays great. It has a set neck that is very thin and feels really nice. It has active pickups in it that really scream. Action is set nice and low. Brand new 9 volt battery in it. Please see pics. Pics are of actual item. Please ask any questions before bidding. $35.00 Shipping. Shipping to lower 48 US States only.
