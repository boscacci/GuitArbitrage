{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "SX VTG MN H-stop VWH Liquid Series Offset Electric RH Lemon Yellow Cream Guitar Read Buyer\u2019s Notice below \u2013 BEFORE you bid. You are looking at a SX VTG MN H-stop VWH Liquid series custom handmade offset electric right-hand guitar. I\u2019m downsizing my collection and this nice guitar isn\u2019t getting the attention it needs. The offset shape of the guitar is bit like the Fender's Jazzmaster or Jaguar. It sports a solid alder body, one volume and one tone control knobs, and a 3-way pickup selector switch to create an incredible range of sounds. The maple neck has an adjustable 2-way truss rod with rosewood re-enforcement for added stability. The ultra-fast Rosewood fretboard has 22-frets, the tailpiece has 6-adjustable saddle bridges. The humbucker pickups sound great. I\u2019ve really enjoyed this nice guitar! Has the 6-original SX tuners with D\u2019Addario strings with .009 as the highest string. The original white tri-layered (white, black, white) pick-guard and 4-verticle stripes compliment the lemon yellow color body beautifully. Weighs in at 8-9 pounds, overall length is 41\u201d (due to offset). Width at the widest point is 14\u201d, the neck is 1 5/8\u201d graduating at 2\u201d joining with the body. Scale is 25\u00bd\u201d, body is 20\u201d long (due to offset), upper body width is 11\u201d wide, lower body width is 14\u201d wide, waist is 8\u00bd\u201d wide. One strap holder nut at the top and another one on the bottom. Note \u2013 strings will be loosened for shipping. And, under the vertical stripes, there appears to be 2-spots of cracking/flaws in the paint, one on the front top above the pickguard, and one on the back an inch or so down (see pictures).
