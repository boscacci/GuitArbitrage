{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I will have to leave this one up to you Jackson Fans. a SOLID 3 piece Mahogany Body!! with a S-S-H setup and a 5 Way switch, it's like a Gibson/Fender on Steroids. I'll start the bidding low and let you decide with NO RESERVE, treat yourself or someone special for the Holidays :-) These guitars are not always easy to identify so What you see is what you get and this one is truly a beauty. Jackson's are made all over the world from the USA, Japan, Korea, India, China, Indonesia and god knows where else. Please do your research because I cannot find much more than a possible 2010 made in India J series but wait... there were 2 plants in India, one that specialized in making copies of name brand high end guitars and one plant that actually produced High End guitars and I suspect that is where this one came from. I am Left handed and a player/collector of fine guitars and was pretty tempted to flip this one but I have too many guitars as it is and am cleaning house so this one needs a home. Don't miss this one of a kind, I don't think you will find another quite like this. questions and more photos are welcome. she has one little bump on her as seen in one of the photos, very hard to notice - otherwiSe she shins like new and plays like butter. Shipping to the lower 48 is flat $40. comes with the padded gig bag shown and I will ship the next day in time for Christmas. good luck...NO RESERVE", "ItemID": "202532342007", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T03:09:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T03:09:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-J-Series-Electric-Guitar-Solid-Mahogany-Beauty-2010-/202532342007", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Linden, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025323420078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/G4EAAOSwXWhcDdAW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UDEAAOSwq6VcDdAd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ljoAAOSw22FcDdBt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0LgAAOSwHGxcDdAo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BfUAAOSwt3hcDdA8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7McAAOSwjoFcDdA0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qq4AAOSwjfdcDdAj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QE4AAOSwDlRcDdAs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Av0AAOSwbKdcDdBK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/S2kAAOSwGq5cDdBU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XUEAAOSwz05cDdBy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rxEAAOSwCVtcDdB2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "07036", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dlprint", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1315, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.4}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 546}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": " Jackson J Series Electric Guitar Solid Mahogany Beauty 2010?", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Clear"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}]}, "HitCount": 202, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 152.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
