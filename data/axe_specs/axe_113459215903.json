Featuring a reduced size ES-style body with Alnico Classic PRO humbucker pickups, the new ES-339 PRO semi-hollowbody from Epiphone turns back the clock while breaking new ground in sound and style. First introduced in the late \u201950s, the ES series became an instant rock classic, bringing the feel and look of an archtop to a generation of players who had grown up playing solid body guitars like the Les Paul. The ES-335, the first in the ES series, was an instant success. But for many players who were used to smaller solid body guitars, the ES-335 felt too bulky to play on stage. The new ES-339 PRO is the perfect remedy, featuring smaller body dimensions while still retaining the bell-like tone the ES series is famous for. The Epiphone ES-339 PRO features a reduced size laminated maple body with a solid center block, much like original ES-style classics. The mahogany SlimTaper \u201cD\u201d profile 24.75\u201d scale neck has 22 medium jumbo frets and is hand-set and glued with a mortise and tenon neck joint with Titebond glue. The 12\u201d radius neck features a rosewood fingerboard with pearloid inlays and a 1.68\u201d nut. Single-ply cream binding on the fingerboard and body completes the classic look. The new Epiphone ES-339 PRO\u2019s Alnico Classic PRO humbucker pickups provide a huge variety of sound choices for the modern guitarist. For those who are used to carrying two guitars to gigs, the ES-339 PRO will solve that problem once and for all. Now, you can play any gig and any style with just one guitar \u2013 the Epiphone ES-339 PRO. The ES-339 PRO features Alnico Classic PRO humbuckers in both the neck position and bridge position providing an infinite variety of tones thanks to the 3-way pickup selector which also features a push/pull coil tap. The neck pickup volume pot and the bridge pickup volume pot each feature an easy-touch push/pull coil tap, making for smooth transitions back and forth between single coil and classic humbucker sounds. The all-metal heavy duty Epiphone 1/4\u201d output jack gives you a lifetime of worry-free use.
