{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage Yamaha BB1600 4 string Bass. I purchased this Bass off Ebay a year ago after having one a few years ago that I loved. This one was a mess. It was filthy, had the electronics exposed and taped over in the back, old strings, and about an inch of grime all over it. The jack plate was missing and the jack was falling out of the instrument. I had to help it out! I bought it for $350 and started working on it. The neck, body, and pickups were fine and just needed cleaning. I did some work myself and then had it set up by Gary Brawer's shop in San Francisco. Here is what has been done:New solid brass bridge with gold finish. (I did not fill in holes under old bridge. They are mostly disguised by new bridge.)New Jack plate and jackNew Electronics and wiring Vintage solid brass knobs put onNew strings (Rotosound Roundwound)Everything cleaned, tightened, etc.Neck is adjusted and straightAction is set to \"Medium\". No buzzing. The control knobs are V,V,T. As you may have heard, these basses were often called \"P-Bass killers\". The P/J configuration works very well. Just to be clear, in case you don't know, this is a far better Bass than the base / entry levels new Yamaha's going for $350 - $500. The pickups, neck, nut, and electronics cannot compare on those cheap new bases. I have invested $200 in materials, plus time on this instrument. Yes, it has some dings and scratches, but it is a terrific sounding bass and is ready to rock! It is certainly worth more than the asking price here. I will start at the bottom of listings I have seen. It really is a nice quality bass. Bass is sold As-Is and comes in an SKB hard shell case w/ TSA locks. No returns. It is guaranteed to be in good solid playing shape. Ask any questions before purchase. Note: I will ship this bass after January 3rd when I return from a trip.", "ItemID": "273630432443", "EndTime": "2019-01-05T02:38:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-29T02:38:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Yamaha-BB1600-Bass-Guitar-Vintage-/273630432443", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Berkeley, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736304324438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/EWkAAOSwwPdcBwYP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/X68AAOSw3MhcBwYM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/olkAAOSwRbpcBwYL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/zfEAAOSwZupcBwYO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/VfYAAOSwsrlcBwYP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/xAcAAOSwnh9cBwYQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/ej8AAOSwU65cBwYR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/hoQAAOSwlypcBwYR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/61gAAOSwHhFcBwYS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/J~0AAOSwGmZcBwYS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/b~4AAOSwx9lcBwYT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/lVgAAOSwAThcBwYU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "94703", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "yorklight2004", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 296, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 57}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Yamaha BB1600 Bass Guitar (Vintage)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Yamaha"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1988"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["4 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Taiwan"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 172, "Subtitle": "Manufactured in Taiwan 1988, Jan.08 - Unit #235 (Used)", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "In good, but used condition.
