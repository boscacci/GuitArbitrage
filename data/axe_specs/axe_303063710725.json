{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2009 Fender American VG Stratocaster- 3 Tone Sunburst. Condition is Used. I have been the only owner of this guitar and it is in excellent condition. It is very close to the condition when I bought it new. There are no signs of fret wear, no scratches, dings, etc.It is a beautiful 3 tone Sunburst and comes with a Fender hardshell case which is also in very good condition. I did not take this guitar out of the house very often so it has remained in very good condition. All of the manuals and hardware (ie: vibrato bar) are included.I am selling this because I have too many guitars and am not playing this one very much right now.This American strat is very versatile which includes a Roland pickup that allows you to simulate the following at the touch of a switch: This is a modeling guitar that includes an extra Roland pickup that models additional sounds in addition to the normal American Strat sound. There is an extra rotary knob on the front that allows you to switch to sound more like a Tele, Humbucker Strat, or 6 string acoustic. There is a second rotary knob on the front that lets you choose between normal tuning, Drop D, Open G, DADGAD, Baritone/Low B, and 12 string.Guitar also has the 5 way switch along with volume and tone control knobs.This guitar is extremely flexible and sounds great. On the back of the guitar is where you will install 4 \"AA\" batteries that operate the Roland pickup modeling functions.", "ItemID": "303063710725", "EndTime": "2019-02-22T21:48:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T21:48:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2009-Fender-American-VG-Stratocaster-3-Tone-Sunburst-/303063710725", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cedar Mountain, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030637107258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/jwAAAOSwCuBcZyo5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/NDMAAOSwyhVcZyo-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/1rcAAOSwEbxcZypG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/NaUAAOSwA05cZypN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/hEEAAOSwobJcZypX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28718", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bjsurprise", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 767.77, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 767.77, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 148}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2009 Fender American VG Stratocaster- 3 Tone Sunburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2009"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 372, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 777.77, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
