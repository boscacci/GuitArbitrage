{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is my PGM90HAM Paul Gilbert Anniversary edition. These guitars are super rare and this is 1 of 300 ever made - There are none for sale on the internet right now so heres your chance to grab a collectable. This guitar plays amazingly well and is currently setup with low action and no fret buzz. I have taken as many photos of the cosmetic condition - Cosmetically there are no major dings or scratches however the clear coat has a bit of yellowing as the guitar is over 20 years old - This happens on all Ibanez PGM's of this vintage. Frets are about 75% with plenty of life left in them. Note: The tuners are Gotoh locking tuners and one of the string ferrules was replaced with a goto string ferrule - I can include the other 5 as I haven't installed them yet. Guitar comes in the original hard case with the Certificate and signed on the back plate by Gilbert himself. Pickup available in Mulgrave, VIC or I can ship to the major countries. in:Guitar models manufactured in Japan, Guitar models, Paul Gilbert models, and 6 morePGM90HAMEDIT SHAREPortal: Paul Gilbert series | Signature series | Guitar models PGM90HAMThe PGM90HAM is a PGM series solid body electric guitar model introduced by Ibanez in 1998.
