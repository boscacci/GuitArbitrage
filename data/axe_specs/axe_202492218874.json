{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Lead II Modified Made in USA Very Nice Guitar in very good condition. Hardtail ClearRed Body with a Maple neck and Rosewood Finger Board. The body is either Ash orAlder. The Lead II was produced at Fender\u2019s Fullerton California plant between 1979-82.The neck has very little wear only visible on the 1st and 2ndfrets. Does not affect playability. I have put Seymour Duncan Pickups in this guitar. Theneck pickup is an Antiquity Texas Hot pickup. I have replaced the original Antiquitypickup cover with a black Seymour Duncan cover. I like the black cover better.I will include the original Antiquity cover in the shipment. The bridge pickup is aLil 59 humbucker. I will also include the original Fender Lead II pickups. I have made other modifications to the electronics. The 3position switch functions as the original pickup selector. Originally on theLead II, the 2 way switch was used as a Phase In/Out when the pickup selectorwas in the middle position. I have rewired this switch to instead select between Humbucker and Single Coil function onthe Lil 59. I have also replaced the original Tone Pot with a new CTS 500K potand ran a 2nd axial lead resistor in parallel to get a targetresistance of 320K for the tone pot. This expands the tonal range to give abrighter sound when the tone pot is set close to \u201c0\u201d. The tone cap is 0.22MF. To the best of myknowledge all other hardware is original. There is a case of Buckle Rash on the back that someoneattempted to patch up prior to me. There is also a small blemish about 3/16\u201d indiameter next to the pick guard in the area of the bridge pickup (see pics). The case has signs of use and wear on the outside but isstill solid and completely functional. The hardware is cosmetically rusty butfunctions fine. Inside the case is very clean. There is no logo or name brand onthe case. I am selling it because I have too many guitars.", "ItemID": "202492218874", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T19:53:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T19:53:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Lead-II-Guitar-Hardtail-Made-USA-Clear-Red-Modified-/202492218874", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pulaski, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2024922188748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAyWDQ3NQ==/z/FfAAAOSwGBlb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk5WDQ5MA==/z/pDMAAOSw4xpb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MzI=/z/y20AAOSwIKNb30Bs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzkwWDUxNg==/z/6KUAAOSws~pb30Bs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzAwWDcxNA==/z/~2AAAOSwMxJb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzE5WDU2NA==/z/ROcAAOSwgYdb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTI2WDU1Mg==/z/TCAAAOSw2bFb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc1WDYyNQ==/z/0xoAAOSwb8Vb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDAzWDcxNQ==/z/gVYAAOSwxFVb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzUwWDc1Mg==/z/iicAAOSw-2hb30Br/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzQ0WDg3Nw==/z/ROgAAOSwgYdb30Bs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "38478", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "scooterw58", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 519, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 36, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 561.03, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 561.03, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 299}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Lead II Guitar Hardtail Made in USA Clear Red Modified", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 519, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 571.03, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
