{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Mexican Stratocaster White/Black Electric Guitar - Humbucker Pickups. Condition is Used. This is a used Mexican Strat that has been with me for about 10 years. It sounds beautiful and the humbucker delivers a crips, better sound to the strum. The guitar is rusty on some parts particularly the screws and pickups. These do not affect the sound very much but might want to be replaced for aesthetic purposes. The back cover is missing but you can get a new one for less than $10 if you really want it (not necessary). The guitar comes in an original Fender case with includes owners manual and original tremulo bar, also very rusty on case-locks, still works fine but not as smooth as a new one would. The guitar is definitely in good playable condition though if you want this guitar to look really nice you would probably spend a little under $50 extra (guitar center quote). That\u2019d include replacing all the screws, strings, etc. I am sad to sell this guitar but I am not giving it the attention it deserves. You are welcome to contact me for extra details / pictures.", "ItemID": "254133482599", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T22:12:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T22:12:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Mexican-Stratocaster-White-Black-Electric-Guitar-Humbucker-Pickups-/254133482599", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Francisco, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2541334825998080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/szoAAOSwcSJcbctC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xI8AAOSw3CdcbctI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HfoAAOSwgJ1cbctG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ydAAAOSwXq5cbcs~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D~IAAOSwqhtcbctD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vgcAAOSwxbFcbctF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8lQAAOSw35hcbctB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94118", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thomasampai-7", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 66, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 331.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 331.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 560}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Mexican Stratocaster White/Black Electric Guitar - Humbucker Pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["1149403500"]}]}, "HitCount": 207, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 336.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "16021982611", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
