{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This 2004 Peavey Cropper Classic in good condition. Small scratches and swirls. Has a scratch on the rear lower horn and a small ding by the fret baord on the top of the neck. Not super noticeable but I though I would mention it. This fine guitar features a refined contour \"T-style\" single cutaway mahogany body with stunning, reverse-chevron, bookmatched flamed maple top (which sports a quasi-\"German carve\" around its perimeter), bolt-on hard rock maple neck, 22-fret rosewood fretboard, \"Maxcess\" neck joint, 25.5\" scale, 1-11/16\" nut width, \"Db4\" quad blade humbucking bridge pickup, \"Db2\" dual blade humbucking neck pickup, gold hardware, master volume and tone controls, three-way pickup selector switch, two position coil-tap switch for Fender and Gibson tones, gorgeous transparent amber \"Memphis Sun\" finish, OHSC case and original factory Certificate of Authenticity signed by Steve Cropper included. Made from 1995 to 2005 in Mississippi, U.S.A., to the specs requested by Steve, this model's neck profile was created by taking measurements of the favorite and most played guitars from the artist's personal collection: \"When designing the 'Cropper Classic' we averaged what I like in a neck on a computer and that's what we milled. Twelve necks at a time on a computer lathe.\" \u00a0 manufacturer's operating guide (also describes/details Peavey's \"Maxcess\" neck joint): \u00a0 Steve told Guitar Player magazine: \"I\u2019m using Tele-style guitars made by Peavey. The two guitars I play most often are the original prototype of the Peavey Generation Series...and a one-off guitar with a very light body and a quilted maple top that Peavey made me several years ago for my birthday. I play that one live. I also have several Peavey Cropper Classics and Fender Telecasters that I use...\" \u00a0Watch the video of Steve playing the Peavey he mentions above that\u00a0the Cropper Classic\u00a0model is based upon, and then click the link below for videos of several Cropper Classic guitars in action on YouTube!", "ItemID": "323636408513", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T18:56:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-05T14:36:44.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Cropper-Classic-Memphis-Sun-Crafted-USA-Red-n-Golden-make-n-offer-/323636408513", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236364085138080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/q-MAAOSwRhFburhq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU2N1gxMDE3/z/yPAAAOSw-L5buriq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgxMDgw/z/8FYAAOSwl1pburjO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgxMDgw/z/PqEAAOSwb-Rburkk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wK8AAOSwHTlburlj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzOVgxMDgw/z/u10AAOSwT0pburmr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE1Njk=/z/cRoAAOSww6ZburnY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUzN1gxMjAw/z/yD8AAOSwnVRburoF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MVgxMDgw/z/ifEAAOSw6~VburpA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0MFgxMDgw/z/Fk4AAOSw1tNburpY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDgw/z/7ygAAOSw6RZburqX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60622", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "motorbikenrob", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 453, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 492}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey Cropper Classic Memphis Sun  Crafted in the USA Red n Golden make n offer", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Classical"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 38, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
