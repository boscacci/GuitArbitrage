Original nut includedPRS double-acting truss rodPRS neck shapePRS S2 tremolo bidgeCustom-built PRS S2 pickups with coil tapAs with all S2 Series instruments, the S2 Standard and new S2 Standard Satin models feature the subtle aesthetic of an all-mahogany body, pickguard mounted electronics, set mahogany necks, locking tuners, PRS quality manufacturing, PRS-designed pickups paired with the versatility of push/pull tone controls, which give players access to authentic singlecoil sounds in addition to strong, punchy humbucker tones.ot only does the super thin satin nitro finish enhance the vintage vibe of these guitars, it also allows the warm, balanced resonance of the all-mahogany body to really shine.\u201cIf you look closely, there is no grain filler! PRS lets the nitro-based, clear coat sink right into the wood. It\u2019s about as thin of a finish as you could put on a guitar,\u201d states PRS demonstrator and recording artist, Bryan Ewald. \u201cThe protective layer is about 1 mil thick, which is just enough to protect the wood from moisture. The finish on a typical PRS Core or S2 guitar is 9-10 mils thick, so this is a tenth of the thickness of the already super-thin PRS finish. There\u2019s almost nothing choking the wood, so it produces an even more resonant guitar that sustains like crazy!\u201dNo duties payable for U.S.A. buyers because the guitar was made in the U.S.A. Shipping to Europe will be $375.", "ItemID": "264204601893", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T17:16:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-19T17:16:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-USA-S2-Standard-22-2015-guitar-excellent-cond-w-case-case-candy-Series-2-/264204601893", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "York, Ontario", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2642046018938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3Nlg1NDg=/z/YeoAAOSwqrVcbDh3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/PJkAAOSwa2tcbDaV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/fzgAAOSwQFhcbDad/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/XkYAAOSwb7RcbDXz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/KSwAAOSwnwpcbDX3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/z0MAAOSwW4hcbDX6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/j40AAOSwGEJcbDX-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/pLwAAOSwGNFcbDau/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/eZkAAOSwkGJcbDa5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/h40AAOSwroJcbDbC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/h80AAOSw1YRcbDYO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DesAAOSw96FcbDaC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "M6S 2R4", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cooltintoys", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1858, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 41, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 668.18, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 880.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 979}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US", "FR", "GB", "DE"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS USA S2 Standard 22 2015 guitar excellent cond w case & case candy Series 2", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["S2 Standard 22"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}]}, "HitCount": 615, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsAccepted", "InternationalShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 890.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "RU", "AL", "AD", "BY", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "GI", "GR", "GG", "MK", "MT", "MD", "ME", "RS", "SK", "SI", "SJ", "UA", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent cosmetic condition and all electronics work perfectly.The soft original case is in good condition.
