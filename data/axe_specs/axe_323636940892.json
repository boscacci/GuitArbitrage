{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This listing includes:- Gibson Les Paul Electric Guitar - Guitar Hard Case- Tiny screwdriver- Guitar Strap Condition: Used. Great condition. Guitar works properly. - A small speck of silver rubbed off one of the frets (see photo #6). - The guitar strings are old and will need to be replaced. - The guitar strap is old so you will probably want to get a new one. - Three of the knobs on the body of the guitar have one internal crack that runs from the center of the knob to the rim (the radius length not the diameter length). One of the knobs has two internal cracks that run from the center of the knob to the rim (see photo #9). The cracks are visible but cannot be felt externally. This seems to be a common problem with Gibson knobs.- When the light reflects off the guitar, you can see some marks on the body of the guitar below the strings (see photo #8). This was caused by guitar picks scratching the clear coat while strumming.- There is a scratch along the edge of the body of the guitar to the left of the knobs (see photo #7).- When you hold the guitar horizontally (on its back) and rock it back and forth, you can hear some soft rattling. This seems to be a common problem with 2007 Les Paul guitars - there is something moving inside the guitar body's internal chamber. The rattling cannot be heard when you hang the guitar on a strap and play it.-There is a faint circle shape on the truss rod cover. It looks as if a circular sticker used to be there and fell off. The circle shape is not sticky and I do not notice any flaw in the texture of the surface when I touch it. The circle is a slightly lighter shade of black than the surrounding area. - Overall, the guitar case is in great condition. The metal buckles have some scratches. Along the side of the case near the top of the neck, there is a long line (see photo #11). I think this is where a seam connected. The lock works properly. The inside of the case is in excellent condition.
