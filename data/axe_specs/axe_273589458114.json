{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a Fender Jaguar Classic Neck Purchased this item in order to build a guitar but it never happened. Was working on 3 Fender Jaguar projects in the last 2 years but I found myself just collecting parts rather than putting together guitars and decided to sell all of them as I have enough guitars (last photo) Please note that the guitars in the last photo are not included in the auction - just in case! Please have a look on my other auctions for more Fender Jaguar fun and a few pedals. Trust my feedback! Any questions please let me know! Starts at 99p! Happy Bidding :) PLEASE NOTE : If you buy 2 or more of my items I\u2019ll combine postage, you only pay what I pay :) Postage : If less than what is mentioned on my ad, the difference will be send back to your PayPal once I dispatch the item. Postage is only to the UK and Europe, if you are outside the UK/EU or have less than 10 feedback, contact me prior placing a bid on this auction or else your bid will be cancelled and you\u2019ll be blocked.", "ItemID": "273589458114", "EndTime": "2018-12-11T20:33:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-01T20:33:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Jaguar-Classic-Neck-Mexico-/273589458114", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "LONDON, London", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735894581148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/KwgAAOSwLSZcAu~k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/KN4AAOSw8kVcAu~i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/nhcAAOSwgnJcAu~l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/0NgAAOSwkERcAu~s/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/aAgAAOSwtaBcAu~v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/2CgAAOSwu3ZcAu~w/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "E2 0AH", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sguitarded", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1303, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 20, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 277.93, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 211.04, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 58}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "UK", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Jaguar Classic Neck Mexico", "HitCount": 541, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "GB", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsWithin": "14 days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 216.04, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 10, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
