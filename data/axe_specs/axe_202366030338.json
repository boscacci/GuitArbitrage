{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The Ibanez 1980 Artist TSB is a crafted in Japan stunner! During the late 70s & into the 80s, Ibanez produced a series of extraordinarily well-built guitars from master craftsmen. Breaking away from the copies they\u2019d focused on previously, the Artist series saw Ibanez\u2019s design and build mentality come into its own. This Artist AR 100, which suggests elements of a LP meeting an SG while departing somewhat from both, it is a superb example of the artistry coming out of the Ibanez factory during what was arguably the company\u2019s golden era. Features \u2013 Body: Solid ash double cutaway. Bound two-piece book-matched top Sunburst finish. Neck: Three-piece rock maple set neck with smooth contoured heel.
