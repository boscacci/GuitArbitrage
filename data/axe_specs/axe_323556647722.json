{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1999 G&L ASAT S-3 serial number CL08473. Weight is approximately 8.1 lbs. Locking tuners. The maple neck, rosewood fret board and frets are in excellent condition, free from scratches and dents. The maple neck has a very thin satin finish with just the slightest of gloss. It is nowhere near a thick gloss neck finish. I measured the nut width as approximately 1 5/8 inch, the neck thickness at the first fret as approximately 0.801 inch and at the twelfth fret as approximately 0.922 inch. The body is in pretty good shape even though it has its share of scratches, rashes, and little dents (see the photos). The black gloss paint finish made it very difficult to photograph all of the tiny scratches and swirls it has. It's not so aged that it has any paint missing, but it looks aged. Note, the wood grain visible in the pickup and neck pockets looks like that of alder wood. I don't know what it really is and some web pages claim it to be a different wood. There are 3 Jumbo Magnetic Field Design (MFD) pickups with a five position pick up selector. The pickups sound great and have a much higher fidelity than the P-90 pickups some people mistake them for. The middle one is reverse wound with a reverse polarity (rwrp) for noise cancellation when the pickup selector is in positions 2 and 4. I'd recommend wiring a little switch into the pick guard to gain the ability to use all three pickups simultaneously or just the neck and bridge pickups simultaneously. You can find wiring diagrams on the web and the guitarsbyleo dot com web site. The original hard shell case is in very good cosmetic condition (with some exterior scuffs) and in excellent functional condition. This guitar ships domestically or can be picked up locally. Shipping internationally is not possible because the rosewood fret board requires a CITES permit which involves additional time and money.", "ItemID": "323556647722", "EndTime": "2018-11-29T02:30:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T02:30:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1999-G-L-ASAT-S-3-USA-black-body-rosewood-fret-board-original-hard-shell-case-/323556647722", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Atlanta, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235566477228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE3MVgxNjAw/z/BaIAAOSwNmxb8Jv1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTY5WDE2MDA=/z/pS4AAOSwxgNb8Jv1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTE4WDE2MDA=/z/vx8AAOSwZddb8Jv1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTA4/z/p1oAAOSwhrpb8Jv2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjU1/z/9T8AAOSwyApb8Jv2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDE2WDE2MDA=/z/dXYAAOSw7thb8Jv1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjMx/z/NDgAAOSwwZxb8Jv3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ2MlgxNjAw/z/ekkAAOSwZ4Rb8Jv2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwNVgxNjAw/z/vRMAAOSw7rlb8Jv2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTY3/z/QdUAAOSworhb8J2o/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzMx/z/hxUAAOSwDAdb8Jv3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30329", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stillpractising", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 71, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 13, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 770.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 770.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 310}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1999 G&L ASAT S-3 USA black body, rosewood fret board, original hard shell case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Rosewood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 494, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 780.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
