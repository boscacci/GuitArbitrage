{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The S-100 Polara is based on the Guild S-100 guitar from the '70s. Boasting a body made of mahogany with a sleek offset design, and combined with a special pair of humbucking pickups, the S-100 Polara is primed for classic hard rock. Armed with a pair of HB-1 humbucking pickups, when you plug in your Guild S-100 Polara you will be rewarded with a wide range of classic tones. As music was evolving into harder and heavier sounds, Guild released these higher-output pickups to ensure players could get the most out of their S-100. The HB1 humbucker pickups are quite capable of everything from articulate cleans to down-tuned riffing. And the S-100 Polara is sonically flexible, thanks to individual volume and tone controls for each pickup. On top of great looks and tone, the Guild S-100 Polara sports high-quality features for years of reliable performance. Like the binding on the rosewood fretboard, which looks great but also adds an ultra-smooth playing feel. And Grover Sta-Tite die-cast tuners offer exceptional tuning stability and precision.
