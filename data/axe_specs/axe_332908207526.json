Based on a vintage-style Strat, the Lonestar is hot-rodded with plenty of sonic and player friendly upgrades that make this one killer electric guitar for a great price. Texas Special single-coil pickups in the neck and middle position are paired with a Fender Twin Head humbucking pickup in the bridge position for the ultimate, fat sounding super Strat tone.
