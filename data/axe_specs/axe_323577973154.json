{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Purchased new in 1974. I'm the original owner so I know everything about this particular Les Paul, any question please ask. Here's the rundown. Back in the 1970's I switched out the bridge mini humbucker for a full humbucker and installed a coil tap. It now has a Gibson 490T wired series/parallel. About the same time I removed the neck pickup chrome cover but put it back on after a couple of months, it's the original cover. The original creme colored plastic jack plate cracked 30 years ago and it was replaced with a chrome metal one that's been very strong. The coil tap switch is between the rear tone controls. Dunlop Strap Locks are installed. Over the years it's had several pickups in the bridge position but the electronics are all original, the 490T has been in for about a decade. The cream binding has yellowed and isn't lifting. There's no rust on the metal components. The chrome has worn off the top of the string saddles since that's where I rest my palm. It has a few dings on it, some from belt buckle wear, a couple on the lower rear bout , a good sized one in between the pickups from the routing from the humbucker, and a dent in the neck pickup cover that happened when a friends child knocked over the guitar, this also bent the G string tuner a bit (see the picture). There's also a 3 inch long 3/4 inch deep crack in the upper bout rear near the strap lock (see the picture). This crack has been there since it was new hanging in the guitar store and has never gotten bigger or caused a problem in 45 years. This was my main guitar since new and it has a lot of playing time on it. The frets are pretty worn but I play the action high with heavy strings so it wasn't an issue for me, you might want a refret job, or use it for slide. The finish is good, I've always polished it after a gig. The neck is straight. Right now it has .011's on it. If you want lighter strings let me know and I'll throw a set of Ernie Balls or DeAddeario's at no cost. If you're good with the .011's then no free strings. The strings on it are new. I'll be shipping at the safe ship outlet so even though I listed it as UPS it will be up to them. If it cost less than $50 to ship I'll refund the difference. if it costs more I'll absorb the cost. Shipping cost is for the domestic US market. Out of the country, you'll have to pay anything over $50. Comes with a padded gig bag. Finally, I'm selling it because I'm not playing much now so someone else can use it. It's a players guitar and not a wall hanger. It's old, seen a lot of stages and dives, and is a terror through a Marshall amp. I'm starting the bid reasonable I think, I bought it cheap new anyway and made a lot of money with it so I'm good.
