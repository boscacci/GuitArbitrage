{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "this guitars belong to my 13. years old son, I am selling for him. I am deaf, I do not know anything about guitars. The reason why I am selling guitar, he wants a charvel guitar. I told my son, I can't afford to get him another guitar, he decided to ask me to help him to sell so he can get charvel.On Gibson tribute 2017, he changed the pick-up to EMG JH James Hetfield Humbucker Set, he said he has the original pickup from Gibson, it will be included if you decide to change the pick up. A volume knob has a small crack, he said it can be easily replaced. The fingerboard has fret zealot for him to practice, if you want to find more information, it can be found, http://www.fretzealot.comTheres a rubber bands wrap around on fret zealot box, my son said it's lose when he moves around. Someone asked me a very good question, can it be removed without damage on the guitar? I asked my son a question when someone asked me earlier today. He said it shouldn't. He showed me from a website from this company, http://www.fretzealot.com. I copied and pasted a paragraph, heres' what they claim to say. \"The adhesive we use is removable (similar to how sticky notes work) and will not damage your guitar should you decide to remove Fret Zealot at some point.\" it's locate in FAQ from www.fretzealot.com Im trusting my son cos I do not want any problems when I sell this guitar for him. As well as I would like to make a buyer to be happy with his/her purchase. it comes with Gibson soft gig case I'm hoping I gave the best description on this guitar. Thank you for looking at this ad..
