{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Fender Telecaster Electric Guitar White Made In Japan For Restoration. I acquired it from a local estate last week. The previous owner was in the process of fixing it up but did not have the funds to finish the job. A friend plugged into the output jack and we got sound so it works but sounded like it needs the contacts cleaned. Guitar has general age related surface wear, the binding had been removed, missing 1 runner head know (just the head), will need strings. Plenty to work with - see my 12 detailed photos. Serial number is A018437 and it is marked Japan. Back has lightly etched: G-295. So with a little time and effort this could be a wonderful classes Fender Stratocaster. The Fender Telecaster was developed by Leo Fender in Fullerton, California in 1950. In the period roughly between 1932 and 1949, several craftsmen and companies experimented with solid-body electric guitars, but none had made a significant impact on the market.", "ItemID": "192820411484", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T02:15:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T02:15:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Genuine-Fender-Telecaster-Electric-Guitar-White-Made-Japan-/192820411484", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Weymouth, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1928204114848080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M9oAAOSwTG5cXJHb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J8YAAOSwLXBcXJHb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cSwAAOSw3k9cXJHe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hR8AAOSw9KVcXJHe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MScAAOSwPaBcXJHe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o3cAAOSw~jpcXJHj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NEIAAOSwA4VcXJHj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0~UAAOSwhWFcXJHj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fzsAAOSwC5RcXJHm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NisAAOSwdyVcXJHn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jw4AAOSwwrlcXJHm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2zoAAOSwJ5dcXJHq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "02188", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spooknook", "FeedbackRatingStar": "YellowShooting", "FeedbackScore": 19217, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 445.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 445.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Genuine Fender Telecaster Electric Guitar White Made In Japan ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 2199, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "South America", "RU", "GR", "IT", "RO", "ES", "CR", "DO", "SV", "GT", "HT", "HN", "NI", "PA", "BN", "KH", "LA", "MO", "MX", "BH", "IQ", "KW", "LB", "OM", "QA", "SA", "AE", "YE", "AF", "AM", "AZ", "BD", "BT", "GE", "KZ", "KG", "MN", "NP", "PK", "LK", "TJ", "TM", "UZ"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar has general age related surface wear, the binding had been removed, missing 1 runner head know (just the head), will need strings.
