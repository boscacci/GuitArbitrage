{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this beautiful Ferrari red Sg special by Gibson not a faded model either ,she plays great but i would still get a set up on it for your taste's some marks and dings on this guitar was played but not abused has plenty of fretlife has the pointers for the tone and volume knobs it looks like some pots were changed but all the electronics work as they should the neck has a nice rounded feel to it which i prefer i have 2 sg's already otherwise i wouldn't let this one go, comes with a nice Road Runner hardshell case. Here's your chance to get an awesome 90's Gibson for a starting price that's less than an import! Shipping is higher because of the size box for the Roadrunner case to fit in Thanks for looking i only ship to the lower 48 States..", "ItemID": "123610865391", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T21:09:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-24T21:09:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Made-Nashville-1997-Gibson-Sg-special-Road-Runner-case-good-condition-/123610865391", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hedgesville, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236108653918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/66oAAOSwvpVcMSb6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JTgAAOSwUjVcMScS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EMAAAOSwSudcMSco/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-S8AAOSwq2xcMSc9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nRsAAOSwQZdcMSdn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ts0AAOSwlfNcMSd~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Y58AAOSw9xJcMSeZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aoUAAOSw~JFcMSev/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0AUAAOSwnCdcMSfD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "25427", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "29-i-wish", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 278, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 676.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 676.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 139}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Made in Nashville 1997 Gibson Sg special with Road Runner case good condition!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Special"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Ferrari Red"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}]}, "HitCount": 498, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 686.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Some marks nicks and dings nothing that affects the playability of this sweet Sg, all appears to be original except i think the tone pots were changed  also their are dunlop straplocks on it.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
