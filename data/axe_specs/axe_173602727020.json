{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale today is a pre-Fender Gretsch Malcolm Young signature 6131MY. Obviously, it is the flame top model, and in my opinion this particular chevron top is one of the nicer tops I've seen on these. The condition of the guitar is excellent, having been taken great care of by its first owner, and then stored in a climate controlled environment by me for the last 15 years or so. The pictures are very detailed and should show you everything you need to know about condition. I'm selling because I've got an original Fire Jet which I am getting ready to restore. No cracks or breaks. Frets have play wear. I didn't refret it, but you may want to. Frets are a personal choice, so I'm leaving that to the one who is going to play the guitar for the next few decades. Original hardshell case included. I'm not trying to make any money on shipping, but I've been burned before eating 100 bucks or more in unexpected shipping. If international shipping costs less than my imagined figure, I'll refund the difference to actual cost.
