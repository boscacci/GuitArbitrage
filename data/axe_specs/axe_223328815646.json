{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Chinese-made copy of a Double Cutaway LP Jr. Everything on the guitar works, and it can be re-strung and played as is. I am, however, selling it as more of a project guitar for someone that wants to take the time to upgrade and modify the guitar to his or her liking. The guitar is in overall good shape, and the head stock bears the logo of the famous brand name company that makes the original version of this guitar. Please note, this guitar is merely a COPY of the original version. It is in no way affiliated with the company that makes the original version. Visually, it's not a bad copy. The mahogany body, neck and rosewood fingerboard feel pretty nice overall. The banana pudding-colored finish is also pretty good. The electronics work properly, and the pickup doesn't sound too bad. The real issue is that the guitar could use a good fret leveling and setup. Also, the holes for the wraparound bridge posts were drilled too big at the factory, which causes the bridge to tilt forward under string pressure. Mind you, the guitar can still be strung and played this way, but I recommend having the post holes done properly. This can be done by either shimming the posts or filling and re-drilling the post holes to allow the posts to fit more snugly. All in all, I think this guitar would be ideal for a modder or someone that wouldn't mind putting a little extra money into upgrades. Please ask all questions before buying. Sale will be final, unless the guitar is lost or damaged in transit.
