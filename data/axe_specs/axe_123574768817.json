{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a very good used electric guitar that I enjoyed playing for a couple of years.It tunes nicely, the sound is awesome and the fact that it's a semi hollow guitar means you can practice unplugged and you'll still be able to hear the amazing acoustic sound it comes out of the body of the instrument.When plugged into any decent amplifier and/or effects pedals/boards, it will blow your mind due to the amazing clarity and reproduction of your favorite patches, effects, etc.The guitar is used, so expect to see some wear and tear which actually shows it was really played and enjoyed while owned by me and the previous owners. You will notice a little crack shown in one of the pictures, which actually does not result in any noticeable issue to the sounds and effects that it reproduces. Besides that it looks almost new with no scratches throughout.The unit will be shipped with a Gibson Custom hard case similar to the original.I will also add as a bonus a brand new set of strings Ernie Ball Slinky Cobalt 2722, besides the set of strings already in the guitar, which are considerably new as well.", "ItemID": "123574768817", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T00:46:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-02T00:46:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-DOT-CH-Cherry-Red-Semi-Hollow-Body-Electric-Guitar-hard-case-/123574768817", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Roswell, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235747688178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/Ay8AAOSw0d1cLASB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/blcAAOSwzgtcLASZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/nY4AAOSwH2VcLASj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/bvEAAOSwektcLASp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/xc4AAOSwlx9cLASt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/HcEAAOSwG49cLAS9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/r78AAOSwMKVcLATN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/XeoAAOSw5wFcLATW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/YZgAAOSwaSVcLATf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/y0EAAOSwESRcLATk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/KAAAAOSwIbtcLATt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/dC4AAOSwWz5cLAUE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30076", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eafonsof-7", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 230.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 567}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone DOT CH Cherry Red Semi-Hollow Body Electric Guitar with hard case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["EDTSWBBH1"]}]}, "HitCount": 616, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 233.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "137088828", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
