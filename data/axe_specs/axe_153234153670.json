{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "BEAUTIFUL Samick \"Les Paul Style\" Electric Guitar with Red Sparkle Top!!! Very RARE!!!Definitely an eye-catching guitar. This Korean made Samick is a well built guitar and weighs close to 8.5lbs, feels solid and sounds solid. This guitar was a project guitar when I bought it and unfortunately still is. I invested in all new electronics, the best CTS pots and push cloth vintage wiring (pick-ups are original and very hot). Unfortunately after wiring the guitar it seems to short out, something is not grounded properly and I just don't have the patience for it anymore, plus I am not an expert on these things. Probably an easy fix since the jack, switch, pots and wires are all new from StewMac.com. Other issue is the frets have been filed down so that they are level, I am assuming someone didn't want to get a fret job done. You can play the guitar but certainly will need new frets to be perfect. I really do love the sound out of this guitar, but I have already put too much money into it and feel it could be a great project for someone more skilled in Luthier repairs than I. So with all that said here is your chance to get an amazing red sparkle top LP and not spend thousands for a real one. There are nicks, scratches and wear on the guitar back and headstock. The guitar is sold as-is with no returns. I hope it finds a new home and will be repaired/restored to have many more years rocking out! Will be shipped in the pictured Gibson gig bag in an unmarked guitar shipping box. Please U.S. continental bidders only.
