{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Bought new at Mark's Guitars in San Diego, I walked in expecting to buy a Les Paul but this guitar was so resonant and beautiful I couldn't pass it up. Unfortunately, I came to understand I just can't play the longer Fender scale length well, so am very reluctantly selling it.\u00a0 I'm just a beginner who is practicing chords and basic songs/riffs, so this guitar saw very light and careful use and is absolutely in like new condition. There are no scratches or dings, it functions perfectly and sounds like a dream.\u00a0 As is typical with the very thin EJ pickguards, this one didn't lay perfectly flat and had a rough edge when I bought it and it's never been a big enough deal for me to replace it. Includes all the case candy, which has never installed or used, including: -chrome bridge cover -tremolo arm -certificate of authenticity (w/serial #) -black leather strap -Fender instrument cable I'm also including the original receipt (date of purchase 12/26/17), dealer price/inventory tags, and Loxx nickel-finish strap locks I installed (along with the stock Fender hardware) and a couple sets of Fender 250R strings (10s).", "ItemID": "283311545019", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T19:25:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T00:50:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Eric-Johnson-Signature-Stratocaster-MINT-PERFECT-2-color-sunburst-/283311545019", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Encinitas, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833115450198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IucAAOSwPrdb82D2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8d0AAOSwy3Jb82DD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/veoAAOSwMQ1b82D0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lJcAAOSwUWtb82D7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DTYAAOSw2-pb82Dr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t7kAAOSw851b82D6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NjIAAOSwtKlb82D8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oDMAAOSwEKpb82Dy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7xAAAOSwJ~xb82Dw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f1MAAOSw-yJb82Dt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0jUAAOSwzDFb82Dp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~jIAAOSwteFb82D5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92024", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "akua6", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 465, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 583}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Eric Johnson Signature Stratocaster - MINT/PERFECT 2 color sunburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Eric Johnson"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["2 color sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["113602703"]}]}, "HitCount": 156, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "19021989093", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Flawless, mint, no scratches, buckle rush, or dings.
