{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ibanez JP-20 Joe Pass archtop jazz guitar, signature model 1980 \"Real jazz guitars have only one pick-up . . . \" I am a guitarist, not a dealer, but I think my gigging days are over, and I\u2019ve moved to a smaller flat, so it\u2019s time for a few guitars to go. I bought this beautiful guitar new in 1981, and gigged with it now and then over the years.----------------------------------------------Condition There are a few surface scratches, but no major dents, and certainly no cracks. The frets are very slightly worn but nowhere near needing a re-fret. The neck is completely straight, and has not needed any truss-rod adjustment for years. The binding has mellowed to a beautiful buttery colour. Serial number is J800934. There is some uncertainty about Ibanez serial numbers, but I think most authorities would agree that means it was made in October 1980, and was guitar number 934. Ibanez got Joe Pass to sign the labels of the first 1,000 guitars produced in biro, so this is one of the signature models, with \"Original Issue\" on the label, as can be seen in one of the photos (despite the staining from guitar polish!) I have replaced the control knobs and pick-up cover, but the old ones are retained with the guitar. I am selling it with its original case.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~From an article in Guitar Player by Alan Schulman : No archtop collection should be without . . . the Joe Pass JP20, sold under the Ibanez name from 1981\u20131990. Ibanez signed jazz guitar legend Joe Pass as an official endorser in early 1980. The intent was to produce a modestly priced electric archtop, which was actually reverse-engineered from Pass\u2019 D'Aquisto of the same era. Under Ibanez leadership, the guitar would ultimately come to be jointly designed by Joe Pass and UK archtop maven Maurice Summerfield, who was under special contract to Ibanez in 1980. The JP20 sports a single Venetian (rounded) cutaway on a laminated spruce top with beautiful flame maple back, rim, and neck, beneath a subtle but stunning 2-color autumn-sunburst finish. There are single-bound stylized f-holes, and the guitar\u2019s rich ebony appointments include a 22-fret bound fretboard, ebony bridge and tailpiece, a mother of pearl Ibanez logo on the headstock with JP monogram inlay and JP20 engraved on the two-ply truss-rod cover, as well as mother of pearl block fretboard inlays with abalone wedge. The guitar also featured multi-ply binding on the headstock, top, and back, as well as a refined tortoise-style pickguard closely resembling the D\u2019Aquisto shape pickguards of the 1980s. Gold-plated hardware includes a humbucking pickup with six pole-pieces with simple, yet elegant body-mounted volume and tone controls. In addition to Joe Pass\u2019s name being engraved in the 21st fret inlay, what makes the first 1,000 of these models particularly collectible is the fact that Joe Pass hand signed their inside labels in ballpoint ink\u2014so if you really want a special one, a simple check of the ICW website can help you locate the right serial numbers to track down.Few guitarists made as big a contribution to jazz guitar tradition and classic sound as did Joe Pass. Yet, despite newer, cheaper Ibanez models that went on to bear his name, this first-issue Ibanez Joe Pass JP20 was a quiet giant that earns high praise among chord melody players and collectors\u2014right alongside the more boast-worthy Gibson, D\u2019Angelico and D\u2019Aquisto archtops in their arsenals.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Serial Number: J800934 Built: october 1980. serial: 0934(factory: FujiGen Gakki, Japan)", "ItemID": "143086123949", "EndTime": "2019-01-16T23:40:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T09:45:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-JP-20-Joe-Pass-archtop-jazz-guitar-signature-model-1980-/143086123949", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Glasgow", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430861239498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzOVg2Mjc=/z/WVoAAOSwu4dcNw74/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDQ=/z/uEgAAOSwyBRcNw1D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDQ=/z/9WQAAOSwe~lcNw1d/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDQ=/z/0oIAAOSwNepcNw11/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDQ=/z/QmYAAOSwKV9cNw1P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDQ=/z/XjIAAOSwNXpcNw1p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTA0WDE2MDA=/z/2M0AAOSwrQ5cNw2S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDQ=/z/AfkAAOSwMKFcNw2D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTE3WDU4MQ==/z/ub0AAOSw3-9cNw7b/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTM3WDgwMA==/z/t~wAAOSw5i5cNw7R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "G4 9RD", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "john-liddell", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1299, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1771.3, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1345.0, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1027}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "EuropeanUnion", "JP", "CA", "AU"], "Site": "UK", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez JP-20 Joe Pass archtop jazz guitar, signature model 1980", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Jazz"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JP-20"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut", "Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1980"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 278, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "GB", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsWithin": "14 days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsAccepted", "InternationalShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "RU", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent vintage condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
