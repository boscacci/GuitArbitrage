{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1965 Standel Deluxe. with original case. Guitar and case are in excellent all original condition. The action on this guitar is as low and easy as you could ever want, plays like butter (I was blown away). I have had a few of these and this is the last to go. Body has lacquer checking throughout but finish is strong and in no way flaking at all. There are some chips through the black to the white undercoat (pictured) on the lower back/ back side (pictured). A few have been touched up with what looks like a marker (pictured). It is missing the strap button on the horn, always was since I got it over a decade ago. The pickguard is cracked and broken at the input (pictured) but that should actually be pretty easy to fix, as the pick guard material is not proprietary to this guitar, I'd say it needs a pick guard or desreves one. I cannot express enough how surprised I was that this guitar plays so well. All electronics function 100%. Everything else is 100%. This neck is fantastic. Guitar is a real pleasure to play. The case looks like NOS. You simply will not find a better price on such an item. This guitar is available for inspection, near Chicago. This guitar can be picked up in person (preferred). Buyer responsible for shipping charges, packed professionally at no charge. Will ship promptly upon receipt of payment. This guitar is as good as these get for this price, absolutely. Many photos are available, eBay no longer allows photo bucket images to be embedded for some reason.", "ItemID": "183531796743", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T06:37:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T06:37:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1965-Standel-Custom-W-OHSC-Ex-condition-vintage-electric-guitar-NO-RESERVE-/183531796743", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Naperville, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835317967438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/SBMAAOSwjXBbpDpo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/RUcAAOSwQqJbpDpw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/wuUAAOSwQ3tbpDp6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/CuwAAOSwV95bpDqG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/O~UAAOSwGaVbpDqV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/1vYAAOSwespbpDqe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/dukAAOSwMHpbpDq~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/VOYAAOSwzgJbpDrJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/-x0AAOSwiiVbpDrX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/sSkAAOSw6~VbpDre/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/PHsAAOSwGaVbpDrr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/mcIAAOSwGsJbpDr1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60563", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jdmvintagegear", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 758.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 758.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2682}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1965 Standel Custom W/ OHSC  Ex condition vintage electric guitar NO RESERVE\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 205, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 768.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
