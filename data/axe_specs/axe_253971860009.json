{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This 1998 D3 Bolt came from a private collection, it was chosen because of its near mint original condition and its mega flame 5A top, it has the usual finish checking around the neck joint no neck repairs or finish repairs on the guitar whatsoever. These guitars are extremely rare to begin with. The guitar plays amazing and sounds as good as it looks. No one knows for sure how many of these were made like this with a natural back and sides, this is the best bolt that the Washburn custom shop had to offer in 1998\u2019 and is identical to Dimes own personal D3 bolt that he used live with Pantera. The guitar comes with its original Washburn custom shop case with yellow interior. Please feel free to ask any questions you want? The guitar will be packed extremely well as I have shipped many high end guitars without a single issue. This is a no reserve auction and will be sent out UPS fully insured for the full value of the ending price. You want find a nicer D3 Dime bolt anywhere no matter the cost.", "ItemID": "253971860009", "EndTime": "2018-11-16T02:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-09T02:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-USA-Custom-Shop-Dimebag-Darrel-D3-Guitar-Dime-Bolt-Flame-Top-Dimebolt-/253971860009", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Waynesville, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2539718600098080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTE0WDE2MDA=/z/A1wAAOSwWV1b5J6E/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTI2/z/JqwAAOSwg11b5J6L/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MzQ=/z/vL0AAOSwQqZb5J6D/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYzWDUwOQ==/z/p~IAAOSwqiJb5J58/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTk5WDc1MA==/z/nbQAAOSwrGlb5J6I/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTE4WDY1Mw==/z/od0AAOSwd2Zb5J59/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTU3WDY0Mw==/z/Ho8AAOSwcrZb5J6F/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTYxWDU5OQ==/z/eaoAAOSwq6Nb5J58/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTk0WDQyNw==/z/27wAAOSwkfxb5KBx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cZQAAOSwjq9b5J5~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTkxWDc1MA==/z/in4AAOSwbX1b5J6H/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTk0WDY5Mg==/z/sy8AAOSwkXFb5KDt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "45068", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "naetrent11", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 226, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 33, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 83}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn USA Custom Shop Dimebag Darrel D3 Guitar - Dime Bolt Flame Top Dimebolt", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1998"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["D3"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Original/Reproduction", "Value": ["Original"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue Bolt"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 1312, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 4400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
