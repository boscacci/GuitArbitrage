{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "American Showster \"The Biker\" electric guitar with a flame finish. This American classic is in excellent condition. There is zero fretwear and the fingerboard looks brand new. It has just been setup with new strings and the frets were polished. There is some typical marks and scuffs throughout with some lights marks in the clear coat in the body and a couple tiny dings here and there as well as a typical finish checking mark near the neck pocket. The back of the neck has one tiny ding. All electronics work great with no scratchiness. The bridge humbucker is wired out of phase with itself and is a little lower output than the neck humbucker, offering some fun tonal possibilities. Does not include a case or any accessories.

Bill Meeker and David Haines started American Showster in 1986 out of New Jersey by building custom guitars that pull their design language from the world of hot rod motorcycles and classic cars. The company produced custom instruments in the US until 2004. Bill Meeker passed away in 2011 after briefly reviving the company. The Biker series featured guitars that used motorcycle gas tanks as bodies. Most featured dual humbuckers with a tune-o-matic bridge. - Alder body shaped like a gas tank on a motorcycle - Six-bolt maple neck - 22-fret rosewood fingerboard with dot inlays - Six-on-one-side Schaller tuners - Two custom American Showster humbuckers - Master volume/master treble-cut tone controls - Three-way selector switch - Black & Red Flame finish - 25.5 in. scale length", "ItemID": "183625354885", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T19:32:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T19:32:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/American-Showster-Biker-TD-FM-Flame-USA-Custom-Shop-Boutique-Electric-Guitar-/183625354885", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Jose, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836253548858080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/0q4AAOSwZtlaAjRB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgzOTk=/z/D3YAAOSwHUhaAjRE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mjk=/z/ON0AAOSwPzhaAjRN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4NTM=/z/33IAAOSwUYNaAjRP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTk=/z/t4MAAOSwHYpaAjRT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzA4WDE2MDA=/z/s3kAAOSwmudaAjRX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM2NlgxNjAw/z/DkQAAOSwDFBaAjRb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2ODk=/z/hQMAAOSwFb5aAjRf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgzODE=/z/04sAAOSwYxBaAjRi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTk=/z/hqAAAOSwGPxaAjRm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2Nzk=/z/wdMAAOSw3s1aAjRo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTk=/z/M40AAOSwySVaAjRr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95128", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "holyheckmusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 517, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 46, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 361.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 361.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 34}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "American Showster The Biker TD FM Flame USA Custom Shop Boutique Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Flame"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["The Biker"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["USA"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["The Biker"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["American Showster"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 290, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 366.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "AF", "AM", "AZ", "BD", "BT", "CN", "GE", "IN", "KZ", "KR", "KG", "MV", "MN", "NP", "PK", "RU", "LK", "TJ", "TM", "UZ", "AS", "CK", "FJ", "PF", "GU", "KI", "MH", "FM", "NR", "NC", "NZ", "NU", "PW", "PG", "SB", "TO", "TV", "VU", "WF", "WS", "AL", "AD", "AT", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "CZ", "DK", "EE", "FI", "GI", "GR", "GG", "HU", "IS", "IE", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LI", "LT", "LU", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "NL", "NO", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "ES", "SJ", "SE", "CH", "UA", "VA", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition.
