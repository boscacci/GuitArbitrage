This still has plastic on the pickguard with a few light scratches and very little signs of use, this was professionally set up less than a year ago and the strings are still ok. There are two tiny dings on the edge and a small scratch on back, it's really close to flawless. It plays great and sounds very cool, the Bigsby is great and the P-90s make this guitar scream. This was professionally set up less than a year ago and it plays fantastic. It has a thin neck that's easy to play with a Gibson 24 3/4\" scale length. This guitar is Bad to the Bone!
