{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "In an effort to \"thin the herd\", up for auction is my black 2004 Squier Standard Cyclone. This is a \"players guitar\" meaning it has the normal wear associated with a used instrument. There are a few scratches and scuffs, but nothing below the finish. There is also a discoloration on the fret-board under the high E string under the nut. This is just that, a light color to the woodof the finger-board. That being said it has been an in-home only guitar. Always stored in a smoke-free home. Please review the photographs before bidding as they are a key part of the description. Some of the features;Maple neck24-3/4\" scale (Gibson scale)Rosewood fret-board22 medium-jumbo fretsSingle-coil neck pick-upHumbucker bridge pick-upOne tone, one volume3-way switchingSynchronized tremolo As with any electric guitar, it will need to be setup to your preferred playing style as everyone has their own comfort zone. This auction is for the lower 48 states in the United States only. As a used guitar it is being sold \"as is\" with no returns. Again, please review the photographs as a key part of the description before bidding. Item will be shipped within 48 hours after payment baring Sundays and federal holidays.
