{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Auction is for one used 2006 Gibson Gold Top R7 Historic 57 reissue that was custom ordered as a leftie, Gibson case included. Buyer is responsible for all shipping charges. This guitar was custom ordered as a leftie. Gibson put a right hand neck on the guitar and added side fret markers, so the Gibson logo is upside down when played as a leftie, which makes this a pretty unique guitar! The guitar has some wear (see pics) from playing, but nothing that affects the sound or playability. There is very little fret wear. Guitar has the original pickups and hardware. We also have the original pickguard, case swag and the original receipt from Guitar Center where it was ordered from which has the serial number listed on it. We were a little skeptical when we first saw this guitar because of it's unique features, but after examining all the documentation and consulting a former Gibson employee we are 100% convinced of this truly unique guitar's authenticity. Guitar has just been cleaned and professionally setup in standard tuning with a new set of Ernie Ball 10 gauge strings. Guitar plays and sounds exactly like you would expect to, fabulously! If you are looking for a truly unique, left hand, Historic Reissue Gold Top, then here it is. We have addition pics upon request (serious inquiries only please.) If you have any questions then feel free to ask away. We want this guitar to go to the right home! Thanks for your interest and happy bidding!! UPDATE: The original owner provided what he thought was the original pickguard, turns out it's not. We are currently trying to locate the original pickguard. We do have the original pickup selector ring/washer and the pickguard bracket.", "ItemID": "123611099143", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T00:31:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-25T00:31:45.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2006-Gibson-R7-Les-Paul-Gold-Top-Custom-Order-Leftie-/123611099143", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover", "AmEx"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236110991438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mwIAAOSwsrlcSk-B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d2sAAOSwuwlcSk-N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/myIAAOSwsrlcSk-b/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1g0AAOSw1T1cSk-p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GcQAAOSwy3JcSk-0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eOsAAOSwaVRcSk--/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gPcAAOSwq2xcSk~U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pLgAAOSwu3ZcSk8N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zIoAAOSw5pRcSk~j/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RSYAAOSw3NpcSk~v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/azMAAOSwqLlcSk~~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MzQAAOSwfBlcSlAU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "73127", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dmbokc1837", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 406, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1725.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1725.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 467}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "JP", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2006 Gibson R7 Les Paul Gold Top, Custom Order Leftie", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold Top"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul R7"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 357, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=74532660", "StoreName": "The Clinic at Downtown Music Box"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Asia", "Middle East", "Southeast Asia", "RU"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
