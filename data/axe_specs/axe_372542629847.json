{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Heritage Prospect The Heritage Prospect is a semi hollow body guitar made with that quality Heritage excellence. Using maple, the Heritage Prospect is topped off with a natural finish, making it a real beauty. With a 17 degree-peghead pitch pitch neck and Seymour Duncan humbucking pickups, the Heritage Prospect delivers tones different from any other guitar. The idea to start Heritage Guitar began when Gibson closed its Kalamazoo, Michigan factory in September of 1984 and moved all production to its other plant in Nashville, Tennessee (in operation since 1975). When this took place, some of the employees were asked to move to Nashville. However, since their families had spent many years in Kalamazoo, it made it difficult to uproot and move. Therefore 3 men, Jim Deurloo, Marvin Lamb, and JP Moats, decided to start a guitar manufacturing business in the very building that Gibson shut down. The founders biggest resource is and was the group of craftsmen they could draw from to begin operations. The owners themselves each had in excess of 25 years of hands on experience in making guitars. To this day each of the owners is directly involved in the manufacturing of each instrument. This Guitar is in Very Good Condition w/ light scratches on the pickguard, and some light scratches that cannot be captured on camera, on the bottom side of the upper bout.
