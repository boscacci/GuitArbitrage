{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2018 Gibson Explorer w/ OHSC Antique Natural This guitar was a gift from my wife (now ex-wife) a little under a year ago and I have no desire to own it anymore. It's been in the case for the last 6 months because I dont even like to look at it. This guitar plays amazing, has nice low action, a wonderfully shaped fast neck, and the Burstbucker pickups can give you any tone you're looking for It comes in the original Gibson case along with the case candy: warranty, authenticity card, a picture of it on the Gibson factory bench, Gibson black leather strap, and the original black speed knobs that I replaced with amber bell top knobs. I really love this guitar, unfortunately it represents a part of my life I want to move on from. Its in pristine condition with less than 5 hours of playing time on it, its never been out of my house, and has not been out of the case more than a dozen times. It ships for free as soon as payment clears, U.S. continental only, paypal only, no returns Please let me know if you have any questions", "ItemID": "143130994943", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T23:58:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-13T23:58:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-Gibson-Explorer-w-OHSC-Antique-Natural-Burstbuckers-/143130994943", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Virginia Beach, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431309949438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lt0AAOSwgJ1cZKNU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7TkAAOSwZrtcZKNT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Iu0AAOSw32lcZKNT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NiwAAOSwulFcZKNU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6WcAAOSwAFZcZKNW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qXAAAOSwhWFcZKNT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2VEAAOSwoMZcZKNV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Cp4AAOSwCcZcZKnY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LAEAAOSwLMRcZKn~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zl0AAOSw9GdcZKNV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7qEAAOSwbX5cZKNW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DkAAAOSwepdcZKNV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "23456", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "b440exrider", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 226, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 213}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2018 Gibson Explorer w/ OHSC Antique Natural Burstbuckers", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}]}, "HitCount": 233, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
