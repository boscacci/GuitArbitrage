Steeped in tradition, the 2016 Les Paul Standard T has all the ingredients that have made the Les Paul such a desirable guitar, and one of the most legendary. This year's model comes in a choice of carved plain maple top or beautifully figured maple top dependent on its finish. Body binding adds a familiar touch of elegance, while the mahogany back uses modern weight relief to add resonance and playing comfort. The mahogany neck is also bound and features a thick rosewood fingerboard for more traditional feel and tone with a compound radius that offers the best playing experience possible, whether you'e fingering open chords or soloing up the neck. The nut width is slightly narrower this year, and marks a return to the historic original width that players prefer.
