{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Shecter Hellraiser C 1 FR With Hard Case. My daughter bought and gave this to me for my 63rd Birthday and I was shocked and very happy but to me it is a 6 string space machine. I have plugged it in and must say it sounds and plays great but it is to much for me and my playing. I believe this guitar is a 2014 model. Past owner has a strange adjuster on low E string and altered the body under it to put that on. There is a crack on the back of body and a dent on lower edge of the body and a chip near the input jack. A little finish chip at top left of tremolo bridge. It has a few bumps and chips so bid accordingly. I don't have the tremolo bar for this guitar or the key to the case. I wish I were younger and knew more about this type of guitar I'd show ya how to shred. Yeah right. Everything works as it should and the guitar sounds great. It does take a battery for this guitar. The neck is amazing. Condition is Used. Will be shipped in the case. Look at pictures and any questions just mail me.Shipped with USPS priority Mail. Insured..Buyer pays $68.38 shipping.", "ItemID": "132950897746", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T20:31:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-12T20:31:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Schecter-Hellraiser-C-1-FR-Trans-Black-Burst-Schecter-Hard-Case-/132950897746", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Carriere, Mississippi", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329508977468080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mUMAAOSwlflcYyk8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AJcAAOSwUElcYynu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8bEAAOSw5k1cYyn9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LU0AAOSwnRpcYyoJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QbkAAOSwQ5VcYyl4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qtsAAOSwY7lcYymA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rPoAAOSwaRRcYymZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o5sAAOSwLXBcYypK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1ggAAOSwQpVcYypX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yYYAAOSw~65cYyp5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i1QAAOSw9YdcYyqW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nWsAAOSw6DNcY0hf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "39426", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "buffilo-bobstring", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 55, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 22, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 106}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Schecter Hellraiser C-1 FR Trans Black Burst\u00a0 with Schecter Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Schecter"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Hellraiser C-1 FR"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 250, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
