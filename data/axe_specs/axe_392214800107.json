Most looking probably know but this is a solid spruce top with solid spruce carved bracing so there not glued on which gives it a very unique sound with amazing sustain--the back and neck are solid mahogany -- the body is contoured for easier and longer playing comfort frets are good with lots of life left and the fretboard is also good--the guitar has been played--it belonged to a working musician but it has not been abused in any way--just used for what it was intended to be used for. I'd give it a 7.5--8.0 out of 10 conservatively. no reserve -- starts at a penny--the buy it now is $2600 which is reasonable for a custom shop arts & historic instrument and far less that the asking price on 446s on Reverb and Ebaythanks for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392214800107", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T00:02:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T00:02:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-2000-Custom-Shop-ES-446-Arts-Historic-All-Original-OHSC-COA-/392214800107", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Port Townsend, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3922148001078080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjYyWDE2MDA=/z/6GMAAOSwpLdcO86K/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyMVgxNjAw/z/kJsAAOSwa3FcO86R/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjQ5/z/D6EAAOSwzm1cO86Z/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDEw/z/Z38AAOSw7wFcO86e/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODA=/z/E-8AAOSwEfVcO86k/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5OTQ=/z/BCUAAOSwUpFcO86q/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTA0/z/YA8AAOSwJclcO86w/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Z38AAOSwCXxcO862/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjQw/z/1cMAAOSwg5FcO87A/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MTk=/z/apYAAOSwxHlcO87G/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njk5WDE1OTk=/z/UrYAAOSw~JFcO87R/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "98368", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "glemons3p26", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3694, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 19, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1984.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1984.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 463}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson 2000 Custom Shop ES-446 Arts & Historic All Original OHSC & COA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Amber Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES 446"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 263, "Subtitle": "offers considered", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2009.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "RU", "AL", "AD", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "EE", "FI", "GG", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LT", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "SJ", "UA", "VA", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "if an offer is accepted i will re-list the guitar for the offer amount and the buyer will have a few hours to make payment unless someone else sees it and buys it at the offered amount", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
