{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2016 Fender Classic '60s Jaquar Lacquer Fiesta Red Hard to find Rosewood Fingerboard.. hard case. Condition is Used but almost flawless. Missing tremolo arm. I bought this a couple of years ago from Willcutt Guitars before fender switched to Pau Ferro fingerboards because I wanted one in rosewood. It was setup perfect from Willcutt Guitars and still plays amazing. Has mostly hung on my wall and played a bit in my house. It has never left my house. It has a few scratches in the normal places on the pick guard and the back where button/buckles scratch but otherwise flawless. Case has a round grease/blotch spot from accidentally resting against a rubber exercise ball in closet. All original paperwork included. Also I can\u2019t seem to find the tremolo arm although I never used it but I am sure you can pick one up for a few bucks. Im thinning the heard as they say so don\u2019t miss this chance to get a rosewood board as they don\u2019t make these anymore. This is one beautiful instrument! Shipped with USPS Priority Mail. Details: Fender Classic '60s Jaguar Lacquer For guitarists who must have original-era Jaguar sound, look and feel, the Classic Series '60s Fender Jaguar Lacquer epitomizes the instrument during its debut decade, when guitarists from coast to coast used it to ride waves of reverb-drenched surf and instrumental music. With authentic features including a nitrocellulose lacquer finish in classic Fiesta Red and dual American Vintage Jaguar pickups, everything about it takes you back to a wildly creative time when rock music came into its own, from surf to psychedelia and more. Enjoy proper intonation throughout the entire fretboard due to the fully adjustable six saddle bridge. Dial in a wide variety of tones and volume options from both single coil pickups with the various slide switches and controls. Chording and lead lines will be comfortable and easier for smaller hands due to the 24\" scale length of the Jaguar. (Most other Fender Electrics have a 25-1/2\" scale lengths).
