{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A special opportunity to own a special instrument. Available to a new loving home is an original 1959 Gibson ES-175. I am the second owner, and acquired it from the original owner who passed recently. He cared for this fabulous guitar over the past 50 years. He did not play the guitar much as is evident by the fantastic condition of the instrument. In fact, when I purchased it, the bridge was installed backwards. I on the otherhand, am a very active player and can appreiate the practical use of such an instrument. It just puts a smile on your face and feels right. No surprises, the guitar looks good, sounds good, and plays like a million bucks. It is setup, the bridge is properly placed, and will be absolutely ready to play. In terms of tonal qualities, the guitar sounds fantastic. It has a very warm, slightly woody and powerful voice. It would be a great addition to your aesthetic collection or useble professional collection. Guitar is versatile...surprisingly so, and can range from Jazz to Rock to Blues to Folk and many styles inbetween. The original PAF pickups (with original solder joints) measure 8.20K neck and 7.74K bridge, and are both very strong PAF's. I have heard many thin sounding old PAF's in need of repair...these are absolutely strong and balanced and sound fantastic. The pots are very useable and are not scratchy. The original trapeze piece is in great condition as well. The guitar will come in the original Lifton Pink case. Thanks for looking and good luck bidding.", "ItemID": "123560750271", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T14:47:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T09:40:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1959-Gibson-ES-175-Vintage-Guitar-Original-PAF-/123560750271", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Jose, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235607502718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/q88AAOSwukZcIKao/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/24sAAOSwkDtcIKa3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyM1g2ODI=/z/TQ0AAOSwgVJcIKhJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyM1g2ODI=/z/2mYAAOSwIsdcIKjC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/1nkAAOSwAQVcIKjQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/p7QAAOSwzwVcIKjW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/1RUAAOSwUVFcIKkH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/1s0AAOSwAQVcIKkT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/e2cAAOSwEppcIKkf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/NNkAAOSwUPVcIKkq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/IOIAAOSwgzBcIKk0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgyWDEwMjM=/z/Gl4AAOSwWlVcIKk9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95111", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "missmelissa408", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1209, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1959 Gibson ES-175 Vintage Guitar Original PAF", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1959"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 41, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
