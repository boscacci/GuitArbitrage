{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "VG condition Paul Reed Smith Korina McCarty with Soapbar pickups. *** re-listing this due to an issue with the prior auction; there was some finish damage that I didn't look at well enough before I corrected the listing (causing it to be locked), so the last auction was cancelled so the item could be re-listed. Damage is identified in picture the last picture *** Wide fat neck profile. Not sure what year it is, but I\u2019d bet against it having a Brazilian rosewood fingerboard. There are two marks on the upper edge of the body where the arm cut would be, which are shown in detail in picture 12. Both marks are through the finish; the rearward one is larger at about .26\", the forward one is about .22\". These are both very minor marks (I didn't notice them when I originally photographed the guitar), but they are there and they are through the finish. There are some minor scratches in the back and a pencil lead sized dink in the finish, but no buckle rash. I can\u2019t see or feel any blemishes on the neck surface, nor can I see any swirling on the front of the body \u2013 but it\u2019s very hard to tell from this finish (see pictures). The headstock is pretty dusty, but I haven\u2019t played it since I changed the strings\u2026 so I didn\u2019t feel like cutting off the basically new strings to clean the headstock. Since I bought this several years ago, it\u2019s been mostly on display with the rest of my guitars\u2026 very little play time, maybe a couple of hours. Auction does include what appears to be an original PRS case (it's not marked as such on the outside, but the fit is formed). I don\u2019t know how it was handled prior to my getting it, but I\u2019ve tried to include pictures of the frets, and I don\u2019t see any significant fretwear, particularly around the G string 3-5 where it tends to show up first. It\u2019s a great guitar and I hope the next guy plays the hell out of it. Shipping will be $75 insured by UPS to the continental U.S. ONLY - I'm not going to ship this internationally. Please ask any questions you have before bidding, refrain from bidding if you don\u2019t intend to pay, and good luck!", "ItemID": "202597328993", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T02:00:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-16T02:00:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-McCarty-Korina-Soap-bar-PRS-/202597328993", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Seabrook, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025973289938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/npIAAOSwletcULD-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/-l8AAOSwnuJcULEA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/mzIAAOSwjYVcULED/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/9wIAAOSw~8JcULEI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4MFg2NzU=/z/yukAAOSwJStcULFz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODI0WDgyNA==/z/kXwAAOSwIbpcULG-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODI0WDc4Mw==/z/edkAAOSwgQ1cULGu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/hVoAAOSwip5cULEW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/StwAAOSwA3xcULEY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/iSsAAOSwcDdcULEa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/KxAAAOSw5r1cULFE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTc5WDE2MDA=/z/s-sAAOSwVv9cZahg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "77586", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "meatfarm", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 131, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1291.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1291.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "8***3", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 212}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith McCarty Korina Soap-bar (PRS)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Korina"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 287, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1316.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "VG condition.
