{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1986 Ibanez X-ING IMG2010 guitar MIDI controller in excellent used condition. This was my dad's and it has only been played like an electric guitar since he owned it, about 20 years. It functions well as such but it has never been tested as a MIDI controller and requires another separate piece of hardware to be used as a MIDI controller. Comes with everything seen in pics. It's rare to find one of these sought after guitars in such good condition. Some slight wear marks and scratches. The whammy bar may not be the original and seems slightly too large to fit in the hole. Some slight modification may fix this. This is an AS-IS sale. Please message me with any questions. It is a large package so international shipping may be expensive. See link for more details. \"Simply put, the revolutionary X-ING IMG2010 is absolutely one of the finest guitar synthesizer controllers ever built. The X-ING IMG2010 has more performance features, dead-on pitch stability, quality, sound, and playability that has made Ibanez one of the top guitar manufacturers in the world. If you use this guitar with a vintage guitar synth, or with a modern guitar synth (by using a BC-13, BX-13 or similar device) nothing seems to plays as easily or as accurately as the Ibanez IMG2010.\" https://www.joness.com/gr300/img2010.htm", "ItemID": "132956701855", "EndTime": "2019-02-24T17:59:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-17T17:59:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1986-Ibanez-X-ING-IMG2010-guitar-MIDI-Controller-Excellent-Condition-/132956701855", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nelson, British Columbia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329567018558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/8o8AAOSwy6NcQ5iC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/NvwAAOSwpzRcQ5iO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/wN0AAOSwKSlcQ5hh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/p0YAAOSw~odcQ5hg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/posAAOSwtYZcQ5hh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/yW8AAOSwcXhcQ5he/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/W2kAAOSwzodcQ5hf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/L6AAAOSwxx1cQ5hg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/7CAAAOSwUjVcQ5he/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/Yc8AAOSw3-9cQ5he/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/LKQAAOSwqRlcQ5hf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDE2MDA=/z/ygoAAOSw~BRcQ5hg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "V1L 4K1", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stateinbetween", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 86, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 379.65, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 169}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1986 Ibanez X-ING IMG2010 guitar MIDI Controller in Excellent Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 235, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
