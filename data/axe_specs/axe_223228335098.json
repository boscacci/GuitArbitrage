{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Washburn A-20 black with red binding with the original fitted case. This guitar is in really nice shape with the usual dink\u2019s and swirling from playing. Red binding on the neck and headstock, 5 ply red binding on the body and red neck dots. Hurricane pickups sounds and plays great, smooth set neck. Also has the original tremolo bar. A little dusty from storage in a controlled environment in its case. This is a very coveted and hard to find model in really nice used condition for a 30+ year old guitar. The original fitted case is in great shape for being the same age. A couple small tolex nicks but still very solid and, well original! The pots could use a good cleaning but other than that ready to play. This guitar has been a regular player until about five years ago. This is a used item that may take some work and love to make it fit your style or playing personality. That being said, no guarantee is given or implied, I will only ship to the lower 48 states. Good luck HEADS UP!! While answering a question I have discovered two dink\u2019s that break the paint. Small but there. I have posted a picture.", "ItemID": "223228335098", "EndTime": "2018-11-22T23:05:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T23:05:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Wasburn-A20-explorer-style-guitar-Black-Red-Binding-/223228335098", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Swartz Creek, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232283350988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTcwWDE2MDA=/z/vAcAAOSwaalb6f7R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njk2WDE2MDA=/z/ng8AAOSwEJZb6f7T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDIy/z/wkYAAOSwL4Rb6f7W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AhAAAOSwapdb6f7d/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MDI=/z/41gAAOSwkFZb6f7X/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzU2/z/wS8AAOSwMQ1b6f7U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2OTA=/z/YIoAAOSwRF1b6f7Z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAyWDE2MDA=/z/brAAAOSwsDZb6f7Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjY2/z/GDIAAOSwcnJb6f7b/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vwQAAOSwHF1b8bH0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rRwAAOSwcDdb8bKX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cGQAAOSwEJ1b8fO5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48473", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chasie150", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1982, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 148}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Wasburn A20 explorer style guitar Black With Red Binding", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["A20"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Set Neck"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 358, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
