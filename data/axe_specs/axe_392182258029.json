{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding I just bought a CS 356 so very reluctantly have to let this one go--I bought it from Chicago Music Exchange--the best music store in the USA as far as I'm concerned and it was a store demo never owned or played other than a handful of times before I bought it--Comes with the COA and Gibson checklist and is in the original Custom Shop Case which is perfect inside with a few white scuff marks and minor tolex separation at the base on the outside--see scans for thoseIt is an over the top beautiful instrument in the rare flamed natural finish--on ebay for instance right now there are over 22 of these for sale and none are natural--as everyone knows Gibson only sold natural wood grain finishes when the wood itself was perfect and could stand being seen uncovered--otherwise they covered the imperfections with a stain--the worse the wood the darker the color--this one is highly flamed--the photographs really don't do it justice because the outside shots were somewhat blown out by bright sun--the inside shots with the flash are closer to the actual sweet dark honey amber of the guitar.Plays exactly as it should--with a light 6 pound 3 oz. body and the one piece back and sides that makes for huge sustain--it is essentially a slimmed down version of the custom shop es-335 with all the power and range and less weight--it's been set up for my preferences--cleaned and polished and re-strung and completely checked out by my luthier prior to offering it for sale-- the one thing to mention seen in the last scan is that someone--either in the shop or a customer--evidently took the lower strap button out and pulled it at an angle so that it caught the finish edge and took a small piece of finish with it--i used a flash to highlight this so it looks worse than it is which is good so there are no surprises--not structural and the guitar is otherwise cosmetically about perfect.I will ship to Europe but only after you email me and we can agree on shipping costs which to Germany for instance run about $180 USPS Global Priority which is the cheapest way to go.thank you for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value--i will not make money on shipping--ever-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--",
