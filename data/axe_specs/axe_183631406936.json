{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 1985 fender Floyd Rose Stratocaster. I purchased this guitar about 20 years ago in the condition that it is in except for the fact that I have added to the wear of the guitar from playing. This is a awesome sounding Stratocaster that can dive bomb like crazy. It is missing the Allen key holder from the back of the headstock. A Washburn shift answer tremolo system from Japan was already added to it before I purchased it. I can't remember what the guy told me about the bridge pickup but it sounds as good as any American Stratocaster. The guitar finish is very worn throughout the body and the backside and face of the neck .pick scratches on the front of the body along with raw wood showing . It is a used guitar and does show plenty of signs of use with Dents & knicks . A awesome sounding guitar in my opinion. The guitar is sold as is where is with no returns.
