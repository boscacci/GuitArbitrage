{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "G & L Legacy HSS Tribute Series Black Guitar. This guitar is used but has been well cared for. It has been kept in a smoke free and humidified studio. There are no chips, dings or obvious scratches, just a few light swirl marks from being lightly played. I would rate the condition of this guitar as 9 out of 10. Perfect guitar for the person that plays pop, country, blues or rock music. Fretboard is smooth and the strings are in good shape with good intonation. This guitar is easy to play and sounds great. I am also adding a like new suede leather guitar strap and a brand new sealed in the box set of Dunlop electric guitar strings. The strap and the strings together are probably worth around $40 dollars. All returns accepted within 14 days of purchase on this item.
