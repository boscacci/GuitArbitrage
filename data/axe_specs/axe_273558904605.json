{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Traveler Speedster Electric Guitar The Speedster is built for performance with a high-output dual-rail humbucker pickup, a unique roller-style bridge, and volume and tone controls. With the arm support detached for travel, the whole package fits neatly inside a high-quality gig bag (included) and is small enough to stow in airline overhead compartments. The Traveler Speedster is great for the rocker on the run. Features:Full 24-3/4\" scale4-1/2 pounds light and only 28\" longFits easily in airline overhead compartmentsUpper armrest detaches for travelIncludes gig bag This guitar was used as my compact backup stage guitar and for a practice instrument when traveling on my job. Its in very good condition with no known issues, except for the the following:The bottom part of the back of the armrest/wing has been touched up by the previous owner (this was a condition I noticed when I purchased the guitar (used). See wing picture.Zipper tabs on the outer bag and and on the pouch have the ends partially broken off (was this way when purchased. Zipper still has adequate amount of tab for use and the zipper functionality is unaffected).I have retired both from my job (no more traveling...HOORAY!) and active gigging and this instrument know longer serves a need. It sounds good and is multi functional (small enough to wear on stage as a second guitar in an alternate tuning, for slide, etc.). Although the guitar is in good condition, since its used, it is being sold as is. See my feedback and bid with confidence.", "ItemID": "273558904605", "EndTime": "2018-11-14T15:22:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T01:44:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Traveler-Guitar-Speedster-Hot-Rod-W-Gig-Bag-Black-/273558904605", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Murfreesboro, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735589046058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LckAAOSwTDpb63a0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CIoAAOSws99b63a7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0REAAOSwQ5pb63ai/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/cvkAAOSwPuRb63ar/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6HMAAOSw9ipb63aZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XSsAAOSwFu1b63a9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37130", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tommyrok", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 241, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 215.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 215.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 232}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Traveler Guitar Speedster Hot Rod W/ Gig Bag (Black)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Traveler Guitar"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Speedster Hot Rod"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Travel"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 35, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 217.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
