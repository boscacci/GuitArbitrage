{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I have decided to sell my vintage Peavey T-60 Guitar out ofmy collection. It has the beautiful Ice Tea Sunburst finish and maple neck.These USA made guitars are collectable and prices are rising fast. This Guitar is in excellent condition as you can see in the photos. Only very light minor marks in the finish you would expect in a 38 year old guitar. No dings and no marks through the finish. Frets in very good condition with plenty of life and everything functions fine. All original except for a replaced switch. A good cleaning and maybe lubing the pots should be all that is needed. Comes with original Peavey Case with the original key and Owner and Care manuals. Due to the age of the guitar it is being sold as is no express or implied warranties and no returns accepted. You will not be disappointed. Will ship only to US.", "ItemID": "283225409053", "EndTime": "2018-10-31T00:48:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-24T00:48:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-T-60-Collector-Guitar-and-Case-1980-Ice-Tea-Burst-/283225409053", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Mount Laurel, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832254090538080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bM4AAOSwB5lbz7yp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/f0sAAOSwxOVbz70B/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFgxMjgw/z/280AAOSwZdRbz71i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFgxMjgw/z/f2gAAOSwxOVbz70j/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/hJwAAOSwBRVbz705/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFgxMjgw/z/dccAAOSwBBpbz71H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Y44AAOSwUulbz71t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8WQAAOSwmUBbz711/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFgxMjgw/z/7i8AAOSw~4hbz72H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08054", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rick5593", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 208, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 103}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey T-60 Collector Guitar and Case 1980\u00a0 Ice Tea Burst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1980"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["T-60"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["00763471"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Iced Tea Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 135, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 520.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
