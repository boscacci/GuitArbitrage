{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Made for metal the Iron Label line is built for aggressive play styles. This RG is no exception. With its EMG 81 and 60 Active pickups and its no frills design. There is no mistaking, this guitar rips faces. The Condition of this guitar is great. Very little wear anywhere with no scraps or bruises, some swirl marks because of the gloss black finish. No dings, no dents, no rusty screws, no electronics issues, straight neck, everything is tight! The \"Nitro Wizard\" neck is probably the fastest Ibanez neck I have gotten my hands on, far faster than my fingers anyway. 3 piece Maple/Bubinga/ Maple not only looks good but adds a dimension of solidity to the overall styling and durability of this shredder. No case, will be shipped safely.
