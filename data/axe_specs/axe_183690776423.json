{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a 1991 Paul Reed Smith CE-24 in Black/Ebony Finish. I've had this guitar, for over a decade and it is awesome. The sound is killer, and you can get tons of great tones. One Volume, One Tone, and a 5-way Rotary switch.\u00a0 As looks, go, the guitar is in great condition, for being nearly 3 decades old. There are the usual dings and dents, but the guitar plays great! It has a super fast, thin neck that is great to play.\u00a0 The only change I have made to the guitar was the addition of Grover Locking Tuners; I like the Grovers more than the early PRS locking tuners.\u00a0 Along with the guitar, you will get the original case, original candy and an original, extra trem arm. This guitar does not disappoint, I just haven't played it as much as I used to.\u00a0 *winning payment must be made within 72 hours of winning auction. $40 shipping within the US. International Shipping is available, but buyer must pay for shipping charges. No returns, unless item is received in condition other than listed and pictured. Don't hesitate to contact me, with any questions. Offers are welcome!
