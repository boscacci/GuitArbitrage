See the video descriptions and hear the sounds by clicking on the youtube links below! Triple pickups \u2013 excellent plus condition with only a few very small dings and some minor surface scratches. Zero fret wear. Original Epiphone pickups and gold hardware. It has three volume controls (one for each pickup) and a master tone control. The neck and bridge pickups function like a normal two pickup SG / Les Paul with a three-way switch: Neck volume, Bridge volume, but with one master tone control. The middle pickups has it\u2019s own volume control and does not work off of the 3-way switch. So for normal two pickup operation, you would set the middle pickup volume to zero.
