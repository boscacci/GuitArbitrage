{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The Shin Series guitars feature the Ravelle body shape, with amazing and exclusive Japanese paintbrush art, achieving top-notch tone with only the finest wood available. A solid mahogany body and neck with a 22-fret ebony fingerboard, Locking tuners, Tune-O-Matic bridge w/stop tailpiece, Graph Tech TUSQ XL Nut, Abalone inlays, and black hardware. Loaded with a Seymour Duncan JB in bridge position, and a Seymour Duncan \u201859 in the neck. Ive owned this guitar for a couple years I bought from Fernandes themselves and it was one of the last Ravelle Shin Demon guitars left that I could find and has a hard case. This guitar has never left the house I dont smoke or gig so the guitar is in fantastic condition and plays like a dream. Ive seen a few of these online in the past and the average price is $1600 and most of the time if you can find one its not the Ravelle Demon model the art work is awesome these are one of a kind shape and look.", "ItemID": "192797077105", "EndTime": "2019-01-27T04:13:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T04:13:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fernandes-Limited-Edition-Ravelle-Shin-Series-Guitar-/192797077105", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Waialua, Hawaii", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927970771058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/yOQAAOSwALBb3jo9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/gnYAAOSwqxdb3jpI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "96791", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "210panther", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 307, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 849}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fernandes Limited Edition Ravelle Shin Series Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fernandes"]}]}, "HitCount": 68, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 510.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
