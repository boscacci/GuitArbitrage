{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello and Good Day! Up for grabs here is my EVH Wolfgang Special. These are the first ones to come out of the Fender Mexico Plant. They really put some quality out, which to be honest was kind of shocking. I paid 1299$ for this new and bought a EVH case for it, because they didn't come with a case. I sold my Made in Japan version to get this one!The fit and finish is flawless. No scratches, dents or dings. No neck pocket cracks either! I wish more people would take the time to list that and put pics up. Nothing bugs me more than getting a guitar with neck pocket cracks! Anyhow, the top on this and 3 tone sunburst is by far the most beautiful I've seen. Everything is perfect. Pickups are balanced, the neck string spacing E-E at the nut and heel is perfect. The nut height is perfect, no sting buzz any where. Its setup at standard D tuning with 9-46 Daddarios. Action at the 12th fret is 3/64's on bass/treble side. She plays like a dream. Ive modded it a bit. I added a very nice light finish to the neck as well as removing the 'Made in Mexico' portion. Not trying to say its made anywhere else, but when sanding things smooth before the finish I sanded into the lettering. I didn't want to leave it half arsed so I removed it. Looks very professional. Also The Serial number and F logo remain. I like a bit of finish on the neck for protection so she got a nice sheen. I didn't remove the sticker because if it doesn't happen to sell Ill be bummed because that was my last hologram sticker. I add them to all the guitars I have. Also Ive added a Schaller Sure Claw, which is an adjustable spring tension device. Allows for string tension to be adjusted with an allen key while the cover is on!. I can honestly say that this feels, sounds and plays as well as my Ebmm Axis and Peavey HP Special. Ive been bad and bought a telecaster on credit and need to sell this. I really don't want to, but I have to. :( It comes with receipt, case candy, Evh hardshell case, tremolo arm, d-tuna (installed) and will be packed really tight! Saved the box from the Fender :) This Guitar is priced to sell and is going to be better and play better than anything you can get at this price. Its not to good to be true, I can assure you, buyers remorse for the tele is driving me nuts so this has to go! If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Check my reviews and buy with confidence. Shipping is a 50$ and will come fully insured. I will ship within the continental USA only. Good Luck and Happy Hunting!!!!!", "ItemID": "233088189457", "EndTime": "2019-01-11T01:19:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T04:46:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EVH-Wolfgang-Special-Hardshell-Case-/233088189457", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Citrus Heights, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330881894578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8JkAAOSwyUFcNscC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dB4AAOSw5cZcNsbn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8fAAAOSwCjpcNsbj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qjEAAOSwRfxcNsbu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KS8AAOSw4zdcNsbx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/re8AAOSwFGNcNsb1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/P5cAAOSwBMpcNsb8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NXIAAOSwFSNcNsb-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g8QAAOSwkjJcNsb5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BjkAAOSwaaNcNsbc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Rm8AAOSwhEhcNsbf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIxMFgxNjAw/z/pWEAAOSwa55cNsbq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95611", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mrsaid86", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 782, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 649.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 43}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EVH Wolfgang Special with Hardshell Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["EVH"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Multicolor"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Added Schaller Sure Claw, Wipe on Finished neck, and Hologram American Flag Sticker."]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}]}, "HitCount": 41, "Subtitle": "With Adjustable Schaller Sure Claw ", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "9/10", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
