If you think your seeing something not mentioned in this listing, please ask!! There are lots of pics, so when you receive it, its exactly what you expected, if not better. No surprises with this sale.. Buy with confidence! Here's The Run Down: This is a Great Playing 1986 Kramer Focus 6000 that was played some, but still in great shape overall. The Original Candy Red Finish is in very good condition for a 80's shredder. There are some flaws here and there from handling, play and age, but nothing that would effect the guitars function (see pics). Flaws may consist of but not limited to minor scratching, scuffs, marks and few dings (see pics). There is minor fret wear to speak of and nothing that I would classify as actual buckle rash, although there is some minor scratching on the back. The original hardware is in very good condition, but does show minor wear/discoloring as you would expect of a pre owned 33+/- year old guitar (pictured). I tried to take really good pics, so you can judge for yourself (see pics). The only change I can see are the addition of EMG's which were most likely added long ago. They are not current. There are NO breaks, repairs or notable damage. All electronics operate perfectly. If your looking for a super cool, great playing & looking Vintage Kramer that wont break the bank, this would make a great addition to your collection!

It is 40+/- years old, so there will be cosmetic flaws here and there, but still in very respectful condition for its age. Flaws will consist of marks, scuffs, scratches, dings, chips & finish fading from being played/handled, but nothing that would effect the integrity or playability of the guitar (see pics).
