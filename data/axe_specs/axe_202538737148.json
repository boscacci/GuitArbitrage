The org gold hardware is back on the guitar, not as photo with crome.comes with alle the factory merch, guitar case, and gig bag. Only studio use...Can be heard here:https://soundcloud.com/athana/berlin-spheresFrom Gibson:The Moderne is made to the precise \"pre-space-aged-retro\" shape that made the original so eye-catchingly hip, with elements of the Flying V's look, but with an asymmetrical lower bout that makes the guitar much easier to play sitting down. Gibson USA dresses it in your choice of two outstanding finishes, Trans Amber and Ebony, both in genuine nitrocellulose lacquer, with the gold-plated hardware that helped the Modernist series stand out in the late '50s. The body is crafted from solid mahogany (Grade-A beneath the Trans Amber guitars), with a solid quarter-sawn Grade-A mahogany neck glued in with Gibson's acclaimed deep-set neck joint. The neck is carved to a slim, fast profile that measures .800\" at the 1st fret and .850\" at the 12th, and topped with a fingerboard made from exotic granadillo. The Moderne's headstock follows the rare split-top design, as also seen on the extremely scarce Explorer models from the first year of production. A pair of '57 Classics captures the sound of the original PAF humbuckers loaded on Modernist Series guitars of the late '50s. These popular pickups feature Alnico II magnets, vintage enamel-coated wire, nickel-plated pole pieces, nickel slugs, maple spacers and vintage-style, two-conductor, and braided wiring, just like the greatest humbuckers of all time. In a variation from the majority of original PAFs, however, the '57 Classics' coils are wax potted to combat microphony and feedback squeal at high volumes so, while vintage voiced, they are suited to high-gain playing, too. The timeless pairing of Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece, both in gold, anchors the strings at the body end for solid sustain and precise intonation adjustment. A set of gold-plated, vintage-style tuners with pearloid buttons retains the accurate look and performance up at the headstock.", "ItemID": "202538737148", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T16:41:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-15T16:41:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Moderne-2012-reissue-/202538737148", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Stavanger", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025387371488080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjUxWDE2MDA=/z/kLgAAOSw5UFcFSxS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K9sAAOSwOcpcFSxQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTg4WDE2MDA=/z/dTIAAOSwvGZcFSxC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzOVgxNjAw/z/xe8AAOSwX4VcFSxG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI3NlgxNjAw/z/0EcAAOSwLuBcFSxJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTQ=/z/p5cAAOSwF1tcFSxA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qxoAAOSwR0dcFSxM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MTQ=/z/80gAAOSwp3dcFSxU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "alfterje123", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 354, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 173}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Moderne 2012 reissue", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Moderne"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}]}, "HitCount": 227, "Subtitle": "Mint condition with both case and gig bag", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "NO", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
