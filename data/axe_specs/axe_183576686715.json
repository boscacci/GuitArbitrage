{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Post Modern Stratocaster With Custom Marty Bell Sparkle Paint COA, NECK Plate, and Screws Included!!! This is a Strat project that never got off the ground. Cleaning out parts, guitars, and amps! As you know we all need a good 'thinning of the herd'. I had thought this body would pair nice with a flamed maple neck. But i just don't have time and resources to see this project through to the end. This body was professional painted in Sparkle by Marty Bell. First class paint job and extremely custom. This will show extremely nice on stage or in a home studio environment. The comfort heel and included COA and matching Serial# neck plate /screws will help increase the value of your current strat project. Weight = 3 pounds 7.4 Oz (nice balanced weight!) This body is sold as is - so ask all questions up front. In hand inspection: - two small chips at neck pocket. (if it bugs you a luthier should be able to fix for $80.00)- one side indentation which was present before being painted- top side has very slight scuff- left over adhesive (should come off with Goof Off) on lower side- one chip on lower size (size of pencil eraser)- existing screw holes have slight raised feel but will not show or present issues when you complete this build I do recommend predrilling before install any screws as some paint over spray is over the holes. These blemishes happened as the body was moved around my studio over the course of year (storage). They could be all be buffed out or fixed but again, the Custom Shop body sold as is! Good luck and bid often... very impressive paint color and very rare!", "ItemID": "183576686715", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T20:46:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-09T20:46:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Custom-Shop-Stratocaster-Body-Post-Modern-Journeyman-Relic-Sparkle-/183576686715", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Long Lake, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835766867158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IhsAAOSwHjtcDXsB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Kh4AAOSwYUZcDXsl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jk8AAOSwh39cDXsq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6D4AAOSws2RcDXst/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XcAAAOSwPmVcDXsx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZMEAAOSwzwVcDXs2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kGEAAOSwezRcDXs6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/d4wAAOSwznxcDXs-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5VQAAOSwGBRcDXtC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yxEAAOSwRF1cDXtF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OEoAAOSw4m9cDXtt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "55356", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nikkovantrikko", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 451, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "4***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 8}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Custom Shop Stratocaster Body - Post Modern Journeyman Relic - Sparkle", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Painted with black, blue sparkle paint"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 270, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 255.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
