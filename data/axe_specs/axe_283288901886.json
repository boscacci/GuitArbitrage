{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "VINTAGE JAPANESE FENDER SANTA ROSA ACOUSTIC ELECTRIC GUITAR FOR REPAIR Up for bids is an interesting old Fender Santa Rosa acoustic electric guitar. From what I have read these were made in Japan and were only produced from 1989 to 1990. It features a smaller sized body similar to Telecaster. It has a 'soundhole' under the strings and a pin type bridge (strings load through a brass block on the back of the body however). There are controls for tone and volume on the body edge and apparently a piezo pickup under the bridge. This example is finished in candy apple red. The guitar wasn't working when I bought it and when I looked in the control cavity I saw the battery clip was replaced but only connected on the positive side. I'm not sure where the negative side should attach to the circuit board so I haven't been able to see if the electronics are in working order (I didn't want to attempt to attach the wire for fear of shorting out any part of the board). So at this time the guitar will not work when plugged into an amp, and I have no idea if or how it can be repaired. I'm offering it AS IS and FOR REPAIR so be aware of that when bidding. As you can see the finish shows some nicks and dings here and there, mostly around the edges. There are no cracks or damage, just normal wear and tear from use. The nut and saddle look like replacements to me. The saddle is too high, which makes the action a little high and stiff. The neck is straight so I think lowering or replacing the saddle should make the action much better. It comes with the hardshell case you see in the photos. If you look online you'll see that these Santa Rosa guitars have a real following and are fairly sought after. If you're knowledgeable about electronic repair and guitar set you work you should be able to get this one back in playable condition. But again I'm listing it AS IS / FOR REPAIR / NO RETURNS so bid wisely. U.S. shipping and insurance will be $50 (more to Alaska and Hawaii).
