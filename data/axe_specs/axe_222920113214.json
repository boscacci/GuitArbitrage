{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Eagle Classic is an all carved solid wood guitar. 1 11/16\" nut, ebony fretboard, and plays and sounds like a Gibson L5, for all of you players who can't afford the L5, but seek something that will give you that warm fat tone with great clarity. This guitar is a one owner guitar, owned by a good player who had many guitars to choose from. Players have often commented how good they thought this one played and sounded when they came into the showroom. Neck is straight on, action is low, and the tone says Gibson, probably because it was made by the most famous Gibson luthiers at the time it was built. The idea to start Heritage Guitar began when the Gibson Guitar Corporation closed its Kalamazoo, Michigan factory in September of 1984 and moved all production to its other plant in Nashville, Tennessee (in operation since 1975). When this took place, some of the employees were asked to move to Nashville. However, since their families had spent many years in Kalamazoo, it made it difficult to uproot and move. Therefore 3 men, Jim Deurloo, Marvin Lamb, and JP Moats, decided to start a guitar manufacturing business. In 1985 when the company was incorporated, 2 other former Gibson Guitar Corporation employees, Bill Paige and Mike Korpak, joined as owners. Mike left the company in 1985.The founders biggest resource is and was the group of craftsmen they could draw from to begin operations. The owners themselves each had in excess of 25 years of hands on experience in making guitars. To this day each of the owners is directly involved in the manufacturing of each instrument.Heritage started operations in the oldest of five buildings formerly owned and operated by Gibson Guitar Corporation. That building was completed in 1917 and has been a center for guitar manufacturing ever since. Much of the machinery that Heritage uses today, was purchased from Gibson Guitar Corporation.The first guitar Heritage introduced was the H-140 solid body single cutaway electric guitar. This model was shown at the NAMM show in June of 1985.Since that time Heritage has added many instruments. Currently Heritage manufacturers Custom Carved Hollow Body Guitars, Semi Hollow Body Guitars, and Solid Body Guitars. This is to say nothing of the countless number of custom instruments made in each of the groups previously mentioned. Banjos, Mandolins, Flat Tops, and Basses, are no longer being produced because of the demand for the guitars mentioned in the above 3 categories.Heritage is proud of its older employees\u00b4 with 25 years of average experience and what it has accomplished in 24 years. Heritage is also training younger luthiers to learn this fine art of craftsmanship. _gsrx_vers_827 (GS 7.0.13 (827))", "ItemID": "222920113214", "EndTime": "2018-12-27T23:15:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-04-14T18:54:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Heritage-1997-17-Eagle-Classic-Archtop-Jazz-Guitar-/222920113214", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Summit, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover", "AmEx"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2229201132148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/XwUAAOSwhCJazlzL/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/y5cAAOSwjOxazlzL/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/X0sAAOSwx2hazlzM/$_3.JPG"], "PostalCode": "07901", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ljdr", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1155, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1012}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "Europe", "Asia", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Heritage 1997 17\" Eagle Classic Archtop Jazz Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Eagle Classic"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Heritage"]}]}, "HitCount": 2782, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=2430049", "StoreName": "GUITARS N JAZZ"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Seller", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
