{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling my upgraded Classic Player Jazzmaster. The tremolo has been upgraded to an American Vintage Reissue and the nut is a new unbleached bone nut. Includes a gig bag. This guitar has brand new pickups, electronics, and pickguard, the plastic is still on it. I bought this guitar locally with \u201cupgraded\u201d pickups and that wiring job was so awful I had to scrap it and buy a new loaded pickguard from the Stratosphere. The previous owner also hacked up the paint around the bridge thimbles, but the chips are entirely covered by the pickguard and bridge. As you can see the guitar itself is in really nice shape, with some minor buckle rash on the back. I am a hobbyist guitar player, not a store, so I cannot accept returns. I ship all my guitars fully insured and professionally packed. Ask all questions prior to committing to purchase! Combining the Past and the Future The Classic Player Jazzmaster Special takes everything that made the Jazzmaster such a revolutionary instrument in the 1960s and adds some modern player-requested touches. The alder body is loaded with new pickups that provide fatter tone and a hotter output. Another interesting enhanced feature is that the neck pocket is cut differently for better pitch. The trem plate has also been moved to increase the break angle and improve sustain. The Classic Player Jazzmaster Special also sports an Adjusto-matic bridge for great intonation. The Classic Player Jazzmaster Special merges the best of the past and the present. Fender style Fender guitars of the late '50s and early '60s borrowed a lot from the automobile designs of the times, which meant lots of chrome and lines that were anything but \"traditional.\" The Jazzmaster uses the same offset-waist body shape as the Jaguar but with a streamlined control scheme for more straight-ahead players. Classic Player Jazzmaster features There are a variety of new features on the Classic Player Jazzmaster Special that set it apart from its vintage-styled siblings. New pickups provide fatter tone and more output, and an Adjusto-matic bridge keeps intonation in check. Medium-jumbo frets make bends easier, and a new neck pocket cut provides better pitch and a comfy feel. Another cool modification from the original, the trem plate has migrated closer to the bridge to increase break angle and sustain, and a screw-in tremolo arm is also a stark improvement over the original.
