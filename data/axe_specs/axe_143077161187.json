{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "NOTE: NEW INFORMATION - RETURNS AND SHIPPING USPS PRIORITY! You are viewing a very clean 2007 Ibanez Artcore AF75 Electric Guitar in transparent red sunburst. It has a fully bound, all-maple hollow body that provides tight resonance. Condition: 8/10, very good condition, light surface scratches (pick swirls) in varnish only, with a good buffing these would even come out. NO dents or dings, or deep scratches that touch the paint. Fit and finish is excellent. Electronics work perfectly. Neck straight with proper relief, action is very good as is, but should be set up by the buyer for best performance. There is some noticeable wear on the first 4 frets as shown in the detail photo of neck from playing open chords. This should clean up with a fret dressing, but I cannot guarantee this. It plays great as is without buzzing or fretting out. This fret wear is reflected in the auction starting price, which is well below similar examples. If you need additional photos please request them. General: The Ibanez AF75 is a true full-hollowbody guitar (no soundblock) perfect for a deep jazz tone, or growling blues. Yet flexible enough for everything from alt rock, roots music, country, to rockabilly. This is one of the reasons I did not have the frets dressed which typically includes a set-up - the end use will determine the precise set up. And that is something the new owner should determine. Mahogany set neck with bound rosewood fretboard and pearl block inlay displays excellent fit and finish. ACH1 humbucker at the neck and ACH2 at the bridge were designed to pick up both body resonance and string output. There is much add\u2019l information, and consistently positive reviews online. Includes an Epiphone acoustic hardshell case. Fully functional latches and hinges, with minor crack at the bottom seam (see photo) which is easily repaired. FEATURES Full-hollow body Fully bound body, neck, and f-holes Maple top, sides, and back Mahogany set neck, 24.75\u201d scale Bound rosewood fretboard, medium frets ACH1 humbucker at the neck ACH2 humbucker at the bridge Includes a hard shell case Disclosure: Preowned gear will have signs of use; including, but not limited to marks, scuffs, oxidation, dirt, dust, etc. All sales final.

Photos and description are detailed and accurate, if you want add'l photos please request them. For sale in US to the lower 48 states.
