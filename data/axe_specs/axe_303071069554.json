{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here I have my super cool, original 1993 Gibson Explorer with the original, pink plush lined Gibson hardcase. Built in Nashville, TN Equipped with EMG 81/85 active pickups and Sperzel locking tuners with black hardware and white pickguard. This explorer plays really good. Sounds nice and heavy when on the bridge pickup and has a nice, bluesy tone on the neck and split settings. The frets are clean and clear with no dead notes or twangs. The body on the Explorer is in very good shape for a 1993. Could use a good polish in some small s pots and has a couple small imperfections but miraculously doesn't show hardly any buckle rash. It's been a lap queen and case queen most of its life and it shows. The finish has been checked professionally and is the ORIGINAL finish. This guitar is surprisingly shiny and clean despite its age. Also comes with a black pickguard in case you want to black it out. The case is original and overall in good shape but needs a new handle and I do not know the combination for the lock. Only selling because I finally bought my dream Les Paul and this thing does not get the playing it deserves and I never really wanted to gig it so I'm ready to let her go. I just had it restrung last week with 10 ga strings, tuned to standard. I've tried to show all I can about the guitar, good and bad, in the pictures. Please view them closely for a more accurate condition description. Thanks for looking and good luck to the future owner!", "ItemID": "303071069554", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T19:19:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-22T02:47:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1993-Gibson-Explorer-ohsc-black-and-white-/303071069554", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lakeland, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030710695548080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/FuwAAOSwcSJcb2IC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/XBwAAOSwXlpcb2IE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/E1sAAOSwHQxcb2IG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/F58AAOSwIO9cb2II/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/QQsAAOSwZFJcb2IK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/CnoAAOSwb-Jcb2IM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/YGoAAOSwxXJcb2IP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/ypoAAOSwb2hcb2IU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/8TcAAOSwo~dcb2IW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/~jcAAOSwk~Vcb2Ja/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/~LwAAOSwpvRcb2Jl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "digitaldex", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 53, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 889}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1993 Gibson Explorer with ohsc black and white", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 54, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used guitar shows a few blemishes but overall in very good shape.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
