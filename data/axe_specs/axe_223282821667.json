The Les Paul Studio uses two humbuckers and a combination of a carved Maple top on a Mahogany body. This Paul has few higher-end features compared to the standard Studio. It has a carved figured maple cap, a Gibson Burstbucker Pro bridge humbucker, coil tapping, and an active boost circuit activated via a push-pull pot. There is really quite an amazing array of tones available from this instrument. This guitar overall is in great condition. There are some surface scratches and some very small dings in the finish. There is also a small area of discoloration under the finish on the back edge of the body near the neck. Frets are in good shape with minimal wear. Guitar has just been set up with fresh strings and it plays great. Comes with the original case and paperwork and neck adjustment tool. Guitar weighs in at 8.8 lbs.
