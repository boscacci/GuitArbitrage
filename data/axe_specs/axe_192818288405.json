{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "LEFT HANDED, 20 YEARS OLD, EXCEPTIONAL CONDITION!! This is a Fender Standard Stratocaster Electric Guitar. This strat was made in Mexico, MIM. Serial Number MN93315xx, makes it a 1999 model. All original. The guitar is 100% complete, including the trem arm. There are marks on the pickguard. This guitar has very light scuffs and scratches, but no bumps or dings. It is in perfect structural condition. An exceptionally clean guitar for a 20 year old. PROFESSIONALLY SET UP AND SERVICED, IT PLAYS GREAT!! It comes with the thickly padded, better-than-Fender Levy's gig bag case you see in the pictures. Features include: Chrome hardware, Fender sealed tuners, 21 fret maple neck w/ dot markers, three single coil pickups, 5 way pickup switch, master volume control, 2 tone controls, vintage style tremolo bridge with stamped steel saddles, three ply white pick guard, white back plate, beautiful midnight blue body finish. The set up on this guitar is awesome, nice and low. The truss rod works as it should, neck is straight. All the electronics work as they should (no scratchy pots). Chrome parts, frets and finger board look near new. I have completely serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the neck and body, cleaned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished frets, cleaned the controls, installed new strings (Fender 10-46's), tweaked the neck truss rod, added a trem arm, adjusted the bridge and intonation, etc. I spend as much time and what ever it takes to make guitars play and perform as good as they possibly can. I can honestly say this guitar plays better than most new ones. DON'T MISS IT!! Buyer pays $34.95 shipping, insurance, PACKAGING and HANDLING to the contiguous 48 states.
