Full Size ImageClick to close full size. Item Description 2012 Fender Kurt Cobain Mustang Electric Guitar in very good condition with little to no play wear and just a few minor dings and scratches. Cool Fiesta Red finish. The original pickguard was replaced with a WD white pickguard. The guitar has a nice action and the maple neck with a \"C\" profile feels great. The frets are in excellent condition. The pickups have a good tone and the Seymour Duncan JB bridge pickup that is directly mounted to the body, has a strong output. The electronics let you have both pickups on \"in phase\" and \"out-of-phase\", giving you even more sonic choices. The guitar is equipped with an \"adjusto-matic\" bridge, vintage style tuners and the neck plate has been swapped to a Fender \"F\" plate, like the ones on Kurt's guitars. This is a great playing and sounding Mustang in a cool color and in very good condition. Looks, plays and sounds great. Includes the gig bag. The tremolo arm is missing and is NOT included. Made in Japan. Serial Number: JD12006901 Weight: 7 lbs. 5 oz. Fender introduces a Mustang inspired by a true grunge legend: Kurt Cobain When Kurt Cobain hit the stage, it was very often with a Mustang\u00ae guitar\u2014an enigmatic anti-hero figure with an esoteric anti-hero instrument. It\u2019s with great pride then that Fender introduces the Kurt Cobain Mustang, which evokes the man, the band, the sound and the times, and gives an authentically crafted nod to one of the most unlikely guitars to ever find itself at the center of a musical maelstrom.See for yourself\u2014go back and watch the famous 1991 video for \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit,\u201d and there he is with it is slung over his shoulder. Or think back to when you saw them on the \u201993-\u201994 In Utero tour, when he seldom went onstage with anything but a Mustang. Quite often and especially later on, Mustangs were a big influence on Kurt Cobain's distinctive sound.Inspired by his arsenal of modded guitars, the new Fender Kurt Cobain Mustang boasts highly distinctive features including an angled single-coil Mustang neck pickup and ferocious Seymour Duncan\u00ae JB humbucking bridge pickup mounted directly to the body, dual on-off/phase in-out switches for each pickup, a polyester-finished alder body and an Adjusto-Matic\u2122 bridge with dynamic vibrato tailpiece.Other features include the classic 24\u201d Mustang scale length, C-shaped maple neck with urethane finish, 7.25\u201d radius fretboard with 22 vintage-style frets and vintage-style ivory dot inlays, master volume and tone controls, vintage-style tuners, and chrome hardware.
