{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2012 Butterscotch Blonde Telecaster Free shipping is continental US, fully insured and signature required. You are responsible to document and report any shipping damage immediately (24hrs) The 2012 Fender American Deluxe Ash Telecaster neck and pickups are what really set this Telecaster apart from other models. The guitar\u2019s maple neck features a chunky \u201cU\u201d shaped 1952 cut with beautiful abalone dot inlays and a vintage tint finish. Many players have referred to this neck shape as the \u201cbaseball bat,\u201d and with good reason-it\u2019s thick! It felt like butter in my hands, and string bending was a breeze. The abalone inlays and vintage tint finish are well worth the price. Fender's American Deluxe Telecaster\u00ae guitar is the 21st century way to rock with a Telecaster. The compound radius fingerboard allows effortless string bending anywhere along the neck, and staggered locking tuners improve tuning stability for stunt guitarists who like to bend behind the nut. N3 Noiseless\u2122 pickups provide improved Telecaster tones for snappy bell-like chime with no hum; other features include a bound-top body with belly cut, S-1\u2122 switching, chromed brass bridge saddles and beveled neck heel. N3 Noiseless pickups deliver the best of yesterday and today, because they deliver landmark vintage Fender tone and response without the hum that can plague single-coil pickups. Using an improved stacked coil-coil design, N3 Noiseless pickups are specially tailored for each Telecaster pickup position. The insulated metal core of each pickup position type differs in thickness and composition for enhanced tone. Fender has fine-tuned the sized, shape, and wire gauge of the pickup coils to balance the magnetic responsiveness essential to great tone. Fender N3 pickups represent a welcome return to the warmth and clarity of alnico magnets. An Alnico 5 magnet is used in the bridge position, Alnico 2 in the middle position, and Alnico 3 for the neck position. This 2012 Fender American Deluxe Telecaster in Butterscotch Blonde is in Excellent condition. It has very minimal to no fret wear.", "ItemID": "264186493378", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T19:33:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-08T12:21:21.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-Fender-American-Deluxe-Telecaster-Butterscotch-Blonde-/264186493378", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Ogden, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641864933788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mhgAAOSw8OFcRH3S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gZMAAOSwQAdcRH3U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5R8AAOSwbKVcRH3X/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ds8AAOSwSe5cTNau/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NhcAAOSwKc1cRH3a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Tq4AAOSwaEdcRH3c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CWoAAOSw10VcRH3f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zzIAAOSw5r1cRH3i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/64QAAOSw4SxcRH3l/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jR8AAOSwEXtcRH3o/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/N7gAAOSw~xtcRH3s/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fTkAAOSwxtVcRH3v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "84405", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "utahjep", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2279, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 66}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2012 Fender American Deluxe Telecaster Butterscotch Blonde", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster Delux"]}]}, "HitCount": 204, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=66253767", "StoreName": "Utah Jep&#39;s"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Like new seldom played with original case candy and vintage case", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
