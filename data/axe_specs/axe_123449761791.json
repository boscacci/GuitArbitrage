{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a SX KY1 (aka ISIS). This is a pretty cool take on a PRS. The body looks like a cross between a PRS and a Tele, but the neck, fretboard inlays and headstock are very much PRS like. This guitar is no longer available. The body is mahogany, and so is the set in neck. The top is flame maple with a natural finish, and wrapped in 2 ply binding. The neck has a rosewood fretboard with flying bird inlays, similar to PRS, 22 jumbo frets and, has a 25\" scale. Humbucking pickups, gold hardware, and recessed speed knobs, make for a pretty cool looking guitar. I've had this for quite a while, and it's been sitting in a closet for the last few years. It must have been leaning against something in there, because the back picked up some scuff marks in the clearcoat. The can be seen in the middle picture of the guitar back. The gold hardware can use some polishing. Anyway, I'm asking $300, and $40.00 for shipping CONUS. Local pickup in the San Francisco Bay Area, is available and is, of course, free. There is no case, but it will be carefully packed and shipped insured.", "ItemID": "123449761791", "EndTime": "2018-11-01T14:06:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-25T14:06:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/SK-KY1-electric-guitar-/123449761791", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "San Francisco, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234497617918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Q0kAAOSwHSRbtGLS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTU2WDE2MDA=/z/1BQAAOSwlkFbtGJA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTU2WDE2MDA=/z/S78AAOSwGhxbtGI9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "94115", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dudemeister123", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 769, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 155.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 155.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 17}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "SK KY1 electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["SX"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 44, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 157.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good to excellent front, very good back with minor scuffs on the back due to storage", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
