Shipping Information All items will be processed for shipping within two business days after payment has been verified. Items paid for Monday through Thursday will be shipped within two business days, excluding holidays. Payments received after 2 pm Mountain Standard Time on Friday will be processed to be shipped on the following Monday or business day if there is a holiday. All purchases over $100 require a Confirmed Address through Paypal before shipping. Flat Rate Shipping covers either USPS Priority Mail, Parcel Post, Media Mail or Fed Ex Ground within the United States, as well as handling costs. If any other shipping service is desired, such as Next Day or 2nd Day Shipping, please contact us before your payment so we can adjust the shipping cost. Items purchased for over $150 and shipped with Fed Ex will be sent with a signature requirement in order to assure delivery. If this is an issue to a customer who cannot be home to sign for a package, please contact us immediately after purchase, as we will ship the item within two business days. For items valued at over a certain amount, Fed Ex automatically requires a signature. Shipping Multiple Items All shipping costs are for the individual items in the listing. If you purchase multiple items to be delivered to the same address, withhold payment in order to allow us to process a shipping discount on the invoice for these purchases. Payment We only accept payment through PayPal. Under no circumstances will we accept a credit card over the phone or any other method of direct payment. This is to ensure protection for both us and you, the buyer, should anything go wrong during the transaction. Payment must be received within 48 hours of closing the item (this includes accepting a best offer, winning an auction). Clicking on a \u201cBuy It Now\u201d price requires immediate payment. If the buyer is unable to pay within this time but still intends to pay for the item, please contact us to make arrangements for a later payment. If there has been no communication from the buyer, items after 48 hours will be submitted to eBay as Unpaid, and the appropriate steps will be taken from there.
