{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a really cool guitar. I don\u2019t know a lot about it but I believe it\u2019s late 90s. I have found a ad for these from then with James Hetfield on the ad promoting them. As u can see the body and headstock looks like a Gibson. So they had to change after a short run of these to a new shape to avoid copyright laws. I think a exployer was offered as well. This one is purdy clean. Very minor issues with the body. Neck is fine and frets are great. Just normal pick marks on body from use and a couple chips in finish. It all works as it should. One thing that may need to be updated is output jack. It\u2019s getting loose but still works. U just get some noise if u move the cord back and forth. When I got guitar the pickup ring on neck pickup was broke. It worked ok as is so I have not replaced. Very minor fix and cheap. I just have like 40 guitars now and no time to keep them all used and repaired so I am selling some off. I am not sure where they made these. Some say japan and some say Korea. I have no clue. The guitar does have the factory case itcame with. I will ship to lower 48. Please look at pics and understand what u are buying. A great used guitar. Not new. And no warranty.
