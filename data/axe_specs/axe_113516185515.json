Item Description As part of the LTD Deluxe Series designed for professional musicians, the LTD MH-1000 EverTune gives you more than you bargained for. It offers set-thru construction, meaning the neck extends deeply into the guitar's body cavity, offering unparalleled access to the upper frets with a smooth heel joint. It has a mahogany body with a flamed maple top in a See Thru Black finish, highlighting the great look of the figured wood grain. It also features a three-piece thin U-shaped maple neck, and an ebony fingerboard with 24 extra-jumbo frets. High-class touches are included, like its multiple white binding and Grover tuners. But the MH-1000 EverTune takes things a step further with the inclusion of active EMG 85 (neck) and EMG 81 (bridge) pickup for tones that range from dark and menacing through screaming and aggressive. Finally, the EverTune constant tension bridge ensures that almost any conditions, your guitar will stay in perfect tune, and have incredibly accurate intonation at every point on the fingerboard.
