{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson Les Paul Custom Cherry Sunburst All Original Nashville Made. The serial number indicates it was made in Nashville, February 1978, and was the 536th unit made that day. I think it's in very good cosmetic condition IMHO....especially for its age. I purchased this beauty used at Guitar Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. It has been played a few times but mostly stored in its beat up, well-used, non-original, Gibson case, included in the sale. It has some slight dings, but hardly any buckle rash. The close up photos are with and without flash...makes the pick-ups look more tarnished than they are in reality. Frets are in good shape. I've made no modifications at all. The paint has changed over the years, but still looks good. The electronics probably need a good cleaning. The best thing about this guitar is that it sounds fantastic...a sound much admired, much copied, but never duplicated. $125.00 flat rate professional shipping to CONUS only. No local pickup. Paypal only.
