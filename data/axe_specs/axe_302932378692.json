Description *************************************************************************It is [ThinLine] of Fender Japan. Evaluation, popular both Fender Japan, MADE IN JAPAN. It is a model with humbucker, one with high reproducibility and good wood making. It has been reproduced with high reproducibility, such as a characteristic hollow structure and a body with f holes, three point stopping of adjustment. It is a vintage-like thin line of tones that sound well and tight and dry. Before exhibition, we connected to the amplifier and tried it. I think that you can use it without any problem. Because it becomes second hand instrument which is living elderly, there are possibilities such as overlooking and unexpected trouble etc. Since there is a fine gully and the response of the control part etc is different from the time of a new article, please consider the age and consider examination of the bid after fully understanding************************************************************************* Payment We accept PayPal only.Please make a payment within 3 days after send my invoice.
