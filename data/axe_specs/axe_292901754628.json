{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Stratocaster Partscaster in dark Blue, with maple neck ( looks black in the pictures but its real dark blue). Fender decal was old and part of it came off.There are some dings on the body, but they're hard to see in photos, but except for a chip in the paint near the upper strap button (see picture) its overall in good condition and plays well.I don't know the origin of the body or the neck, but would guess they're both import (maybe squier ?). I am selling due to thinning out some of my guitars that don't get used anymore.I have described this guitar to the best of my knowledge so please don't buy it, tear it apart and say \"its not a real Fender\".Sorry, no case or gig bag.If any questions, please email me and thanks for looking.", "ItemID": "292901754628", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T00:47:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-03T21:37:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Stratocaster-Partscaster-worn-Fender-head-stock-decal-/292901754628", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Hastings, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929017546288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/h~UAAOSwpLVcLnvi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/EBoAAOSwRbpcLnv0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/0rEAAOSwEONcLnwr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/E~EAAOSw6eRcLnxc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/91AAAOSwmepcLnyX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/xxAAAOSwhr9cLnys/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/VtsAAOSwnjZcLnzZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ShcAAOSwdzhcLnzs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/0nMAAOSwDmxcLn0Q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ZLIAAOSwgVJcLn0u/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "13076", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "toadster341", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 259, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***n", "FeedbackPrivate": true, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 931}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Stratocaster Partscaster with worn Fender head stock decal", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 280, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
