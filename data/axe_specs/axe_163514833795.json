{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Offering a really nice 1972 sunburst Fender Mustang guitar in the original Victoria gray case in excellent condition. I have a 1967 Mustang and sonically prefer this one. Noticeably resonant instrument and the pickups sound really good. I play a lot of guitars and feel it stands out as a great one. There are no serious issues, but you will notice there appears to be some melted finish by the rear strap button on the face of the guitar. Maybe a cigarette was laid there. The other thing you'll see is some cool hand wear on the underside of the neck on the lower frets. The whammy bar hole seems to have a metal sleeve inserted so you'll need to remove that somehow. Will see if my guitar tech can get it out. Minimal fret wear and low action, straight neck. I can provide a video link if you want to hear it and see it that way too.
