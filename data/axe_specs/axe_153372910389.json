{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Beautiful and good condition SV800 Walnut Type. Made in Japan on 1979. The sound is good, electronics work well. The frets are about 70% with some small dings, chips and scratches, but overall appearance is good. There is a break in the jack as you can see in the pics, but working well. The gig case in the pics is included as well but not in a good condition so please take it as bonus only. \u25c6 Shipping and Packaging CONCERN ABOUT THE GUITAR SAFETY???? I have sent many guitars outside and never had a problem. My packaging is very very safe!! Better than any of Japanese sellers here in ebay! You can trust that!! Check the pic below!! I pack very carefully and full with bubble wrap outside. I use EMS service for shipping methods. It`s the most safe and quickly way of shipping from Japan and only takes 2 to 5 days from Japan to USA,CANADA,3 to 7 days to Asia, Australia and Europe. The rate is $130 to everywhere!! Actually it will be around 160 to 180 I have to pay, but it is OK. Just pay $130!! And PLEASE DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT SHIPPING CHARGE, AS THAT IS HOW MUCH IT REALLY COSTS(or more) DUE TO VERY HEAVY WEIGHT AS SOME OTHER SELLER EVEN COST MORE FROM JAPAN. BESIDES THE VERY EXPENSIVE EBAY FINAL VALUE FEE & PAYPAL FEE\u2019S, EBAY NOW CHARGES FINAL VALUE FEE ON SHIPPING CHARGE TOO. THE SHIPPING COST IS WRITTEN CLEARLY ON THE EMS ADDRESS LABEL IN JAPANESE YEN, SO THE BUYER WILL SEE THE ACTUAL COST OF SHIPPING.I DO NOT MAKE PROFIT OF SHIPPING!!! IMPORTANT NOTE: 1.
