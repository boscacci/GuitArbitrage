{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "US-made vintage G&L for the price of a new Asian model. They don't make this one anymore. Frets very little wear, recent setup with fresh strings, no buzzes. Neck and middle pickups original, bridge is a new G&L ASAT Classic pickup for more spank. I also have an extra leopard pattern pickguard you can have. The jack has been moved to the side and the extra pickguard space has been used to wire this like modern G&Ls: adds the neck/bridge combo (Telecaster middle sound) AND a bass roll-off pot. Look up G&L's \u201cPTB\u201d feature for more information. Very very versatile guitar! I've owned this for several years; earlier owner had a crack in the headstock that was fixed solid: that's why there's no logo. But this is the original 3-bolt Fullerton neck and the crack is dead-solid. I have a Fender gig bag for you. These go for at least $600 here. I\u2019m asking just $425 because it\u2019s not stock and has the repaired headstock. Before you buy ANY Legacy or S-500 or Stratocaster or G&L Tribute, check this one out.", "ItemID": "283390372855", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T16:11:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-22T04:09:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-L-SC-3-PRICE-DROP-/283390372855", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Evanston, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833903728558080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTQy/z/vy0AAOSwAE9cb3Wj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4ODg=/z/TpgAAOSw5E1cb3Wi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mzg=/z/LOIAAOSwotZcb3We/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MjI=/z/8SsAAOSwslJcb3Wk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjIy/z/OB4AAOSwyutcb3Wn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1Nzg=/z/AQsAAOSwBBRcb3Wl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/osMAAOSw8Alcb3Wp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDU2Mg==/z/0MwAAOSwUTZccH6y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60201", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "noahlib", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 212, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 415.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 415.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1603}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G&L SC-3 \u2014 PRICE DROP!!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}]}, "HitCount": 129, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
