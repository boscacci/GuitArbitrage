{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Jason Hook M-4 Sherman Explorer / Electric Guitar w/ HC made in 2012Item Description Manufacturer: Gibson Model: Jason Hook M-4 Sherman Explorer Age: 2012 Jason Hook acting as a guitarist of American heavy metal band \"Five Finger Death Punch\" Manufactured in 2012 from Gibson \"Signature Series Jason Hook M - 4 Sherman Explorer\" Shaman Graphics decides the overall impression. Contour processing is given to the body top, and the cutaway part is also deeper than ordinary Explorer, realizing smooth fingering to high fret. It spreads with a nut width of about 43.5 mm, a neck of 12 frets at about 53.5 mm, and the neck thickness is also thin and it is an impression of a flat feeling. I think that it is compatible with Jumbo frets with less burden of pressing fingers, I think that it is a fast playing ^ ^ Pickup is \"Seymour Duncan JH\" for some reason why, but implementation \"59 model & JB model\" classic It is specification. If it is compatible with the explorer of the mahogany body, in other words, should it be said that the specification is easy to handle without bias? Although there are small scratches, etc., it is used less frequently and it becomes a beautiful product. Please experience not only the fans, but also highly expressive explorer ^ ^Manufacture year: 2012 pickup: passive pickup composition: HH number of frets: 22 fret neck scale: medium weight: 3.80 kg body material: mahogany tremolo: none finger board material: rosewood neck joint: set neck neck material: mahogany accessory Case, instruction manual", "ItemID": "113623410417", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T19:43:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-07T21:05:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Jason-Hook-M-4-Sherman-Explorer-Electric-Guitar-w-HC-made-2012-/113623410417", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Japan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136234104178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDEyMDA=/z/BbMAAOSwe0tcXJ0b/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDEyMDA=/z/zo8AAOSwB9NcXJ0f/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDEyMDA=/z/45EAAOSw-ttcXJ0X/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tresurejapan", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 73, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.3}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1698.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1698.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Jason Hook M-4 Sherman Explorer / Electric Guitar w/ HC made in 2012", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Jason Hook M-4 Sherman Explorer"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}]}, "HitCount": 109, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1630866429", "StoreName": "tresurejapan"}, "Country": "JP", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money back or replacement (buyer's choice)", "ReturnsWithin": "60 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["AZ", "JP", "TJ", "BO", "PE", "IQ", "TR", "YE"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Although this guitar has fine scratches, etc., it is used less frequently and it becomes a beautiful product.
