{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Rare 1 pickup vintage ES-175 example from 1952 with \u201cZ\u201d body code in very nice condition! There is a slight buzz on the 2nd fret D string area but the guitar plays wonderfully otherwise. New owner may decide to re-fret it in the future for optimal playability but it is currently original and unmodified other than a new nut and a small make shift \u201cstrap button\u201d hook installed in the rear of the guitar (pictured). This guitar has been set up by a professional luthier and will be shipped carefully and packed well in its original case (excellent condition) with case candy (pictured) included. I have sold many vintage musical instruments on other well known selling platforms in the past and will now begin selling on eBay that is the reason for zero feedback please bid with confidence this is a beautiful and classy early '50s Gibson guitar which will be delivered promptly and as described. International shipping available at buyer's expense based on location.", "ItemID": "173755618080", "EndTime": "2019-01-29T18:01:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-22T18:01:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1952-Gibson-ES-175-vintage-electric-guitar-/173755618080", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Hollywood, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737556180808080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iqEAAOSwOHpcR1o7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z3UAAOSwjoFcR1o5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AiYAAOSwaJ9cR1o6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/j0sAAOSw6EpcR1o6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ChgAAOSwPv5cR1pA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/29wAAOSwwfFcR1pA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MJEAAOSw9z9cR1pA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk4/z/zy8AAOSw8zNcR1pA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3jsAAOSwuZ9cR1pE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/00kAAOSwf0hcR1pE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5cIAAOSw7wFcR1pF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6kMAAOSwvpVcR1pF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33019", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "letsgo1590", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2901.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2901.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 684}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1952 Gibson ES-175 vintage electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-175"]}]}, "HitCount": 319, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2951.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
