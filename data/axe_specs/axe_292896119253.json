{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A few years back Gibson offered the first FZ tribute guitar. The ROXY. Knowone has reborn the coolest of all Franks guitars ...........YET Ladies and Gents........The ultimate FZ axe.......THE BABY SNAKES SG (my take)There is a great bit on Tube where Dweezil Zappa shows off his dad's guitars, The BABY SNAKES SG is the coolest! Check it out.HISTORY ON THE GUITAR: The serial numbers are gone. This is a GREAT players grade Gibson SG. Actually it is a 64 SG Junior routed for two Humbuckers. The only original things on the guitar that are original are the body wood , neck wood, including the fretboard, frets and the original neck set (which is perfect all the way around including the neck set angle). THERE ARE NO CRACK BREAKS OR DAMAGE TO THE WOOD. The neck and body have THE ORIGINAL NECK SET and never been separated. The body is ONE piece-no center seam. The neck is one piece. The jack input has been moved to the side. There is an extra input hole near the jack which has been plugged. see pic. TRUE STRORY: I sold this guitar, all original with serial numbers to good friend of mine in my neighborhood when i was 16 years old. I bought it back when i was 55 years old. It had been thru 2 refin jobs at that time. When i bought it back it was painted SCHOOL BUS yellow...........with a brush...............with school bus paint.........by hippies!! Sadly no serial numbers left. The guitars new life is a tribute to the GRAND MASTER of EVERYTHING! FRANK ZAPPASince this guitars rebirth it has NOTHING played on it but ALL ZAPPA..............all the time........ats it!This is a list of the restoration work done to creat my version of Frank Zappa's famous Baby Snakes Guitar.First of all, the Baby Snakes guitar was not a Gibson. It was built by an unknown maker, TH\\his one is definitely a Gibson. At least the wood is.The guitar was completely stripped of all old coatings and redone is Gloss, nitro celllulose lacquer.The top center section was bound with white/yellowed binding and veneered with exotic veneer which was hand picked to match the grain on FZ's guitar.The veneer used was Eucaliptis/hybrid.The black knots in the veneer are actually hand cut hand fitted pieces of Ebony specifically cut to match the knotty sections on Zappa,s guitar.......Lots of labor in this guitar.The pickups are my personal fave's JBE (aka Joe Barden) JB in the neck and a JB Two tone in the bridge.The guitar is wired very simple, just a standard two humbucker set up with a standard three way toggle with a master tone and master volume knobs. Currently the mini switches do not function. The electronics all work great and the JBE pickups are known for being totally silent opera.Tuners are Gibsons and are only 2 years oldThe headstock has a new Ebony veneer with NEW flower pot and new GIB... logo installedAll newly replaced Jack, wiring pots........all electricalThis guitar is Super light weight and perfectly balanced and made off very tight grained premium 50+ year old Honduran Mahogany. (the old good stuff from the 60's) Brazilian Rosewood fretboard LOW ACTION!Fantastic PLAYERS guitar.
