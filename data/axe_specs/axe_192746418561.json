The Exit22 features a solid mahogany body and a rock maple neck. The Exit22 was the first Godin guitar to combine a 24\u00be scale with Godin's new 22-fret neck. \u00a0This combination not only produces ultra comfortable feel and balance, it also delivers big in the sound department. Where many guitars tend to excel specifically for distortion sounds or clean sounds the Exit 22 does it all. Monstrous distortion tones are easily dialed in via the Godin humbucker in the bridge, and stinging clean sounds are also at your fingertips thanks to the Godin Single coil pickups in the neck and middle position. The Exit 22 is finished with a semi-gloss finish that gives it a beautiful understated look. \u00a0Included are the soft case and a few extras as seen below. \u00a0Any questions please ask Brand: Godin Instrument Name: Exit22-S Instrument Type: Electric Guitar Number of Strings: 6 Make location:USA(parts crafted in Canada) Dexterity: Right Handed NOTE:\u00a0If it\u2019s not in the photos it\u2019s not included.
