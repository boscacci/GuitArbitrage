{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This flamed maple top Strat-style guitar plays and sounds as great as it looks. My photos don't quite to it justice. It's beautiful. The guitar has been upgraded with black tuning keys, pickguard, and high-quality pickups from Guitar Fetish. No dings, scratches or wear on the guitar. It's virtually new. Included in the price is a high-quality gig back and guitar strap. This is truly a one-of-a-kind. Don't let it get away! This gorgeous guitar would make an excellent Xmas gift for someone. The guitar was setup by hand in Southern California. Setups include having the frets filed so they are free of sharp edges, ensuring that the nut and bridge are properly seated at the correct height, that the strings have the right amount of action with no buzzing, and that the electronics are functioning properly On Dec-05-18 at 17:21:18 PST, seller added the following information: I meant gig \"bag\" not back.", "ItemID": "153283142262", "EndTime": "2018-12-06T20:29:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-29T20:29:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Indio-Cali-DLX-Flamed-Maple-Top-Electric-Guitar-Gig-Bag-Trans-Red-/153283142262", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Layton, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532831422628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/MY4AAOSwsn9cAErt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/~NUAAOSwm51cAEy-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/0pEAAOSwcOZcAErx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/K24AAOSwpLdcAEr9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/zO0AAOSwCPZcAEsJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/idoAAOSwtutcAEsN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/P0QAAOSwZ3pcAEsQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/jzkAAOSwWH1cAEsX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/BesAAOSwF8FcAEsV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/S0gAAOSwabRcAEsa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84041", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fooddude11", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 116, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 468}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Indio Cali DLX Flamed Maple Top Electric Guitar with Gig Bag Trans Red", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Indio"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Cali DLX"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Guitar Fetish Pickups"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Gig Bag"]}, {"Name": "Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Cali DLX"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["610402"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 119, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
