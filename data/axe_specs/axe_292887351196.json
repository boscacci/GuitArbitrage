There are a few dings/indentations on the edge of the upper horn (pictured). Also, the back of the neck has some very light surface rub (pictured). Other than that, the guitar is in excellent condition. No buckle rash, no pick scratches, etc. It just received a set up and sounds amazing. The case has a ding on it (pictured). Shipping is $200 due to the large over-sized baritone case. I'd keep it due to the rare number of them out there, but I also have too many guitars and need to move some. You don't see many of these come along for sale and that is because of the limited run and the are flat out great guitars! Any questions, please feel free to ask.
