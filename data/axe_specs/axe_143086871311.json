You are looking at a 2018 Jackson X Series Soloist SL4X Electric Guitar. This is a High Performance Guitar. Modern Metal Players Dream. From The Web: The Jackson name has always been synonymous with state-of-the-art guitar technology and playing, leading the way in crafting instruments that exceed the demands of modern players. The Jackson SL4X Soloist solidbody electric guitar is a modern metal player's dream. With a maple neck and lightning-fast rosewood compound-radius fingerboard, you'll be free to explore and hone your own style. In addition, a flexible trio of Duncan Designed pickups, three high-output HR-101 Hot Rails humbucking pickups in the bridge, middle, and neck positions, give you a massive array of tonal possibilities. A Floyd Rose double-locking tremolo also gives the SL4X Soloist some serious dive-bombing capability. Topped off with eye-catching black nickel hardware, the Jackson SL4X Soloist is gig-ready when you are. With a third Duncan Designed HR-101 Hot Rails pickup added between the neck and bridge pickup, we\u2019ve unlocked an even wider and more versatile range of tones. Hot wound rails coupled with a powerful ceramic magnet power this musical beast with the aggressive crunch and sustain hard rock and metal styles demand. With single volume and tone controls and a five-way blade switch, players can explore a variety of pickup combinations, while a Floyd Rose Special double-locking tremolo (recessed for picking hand comfort) bridge system provides superior string stability, sustain and dynamic tremolo action. Featuring a 25.5\u201d scale length, the SL4X is crafted out of basswood and coupled with a one-piece through-body maple neck with graphite reinforcement and scarf joint, providing stability against the ravages of the road. Wrapped in white binding, its 12\u201d -16\u201d compound radius rosewood fingerboard features 24 jumbo frets and dot inlays.
