Double cutaway, light weight, mahogany, arch top body. Cepheus passive humbucker pickups.

The sturdy neck through construction allows easier access to upper frets, provides greater sustain, and keeps the instrument in tune longer. Cepheus 8 high mass extended range fixed bridge. Having high mass improves the sustain. The extended range of saddle movement allows the widest range of tunings and non-standard string gauges. Maple fretboard with no markers. In response to the popular request of customers, position markers are located on the side of the neck. Adjustable truss rod in neck to offset alterations caused by changes in humidity, temperature, or new strings.
