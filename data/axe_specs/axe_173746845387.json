{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Very nice looking and playing small body acoustic-electric with strat-style headstock with very little scratching or wear that's a blast to play. Very stageable with on-board Fishman electronics and tuner. Great guitar for any level player. The strings are on it are pretty light and to me the action is low and comfortable to play. This is the very well made 2000's Korean made Malibu SCE with solid spruce top and solid mahogany back and not the current laminate China made model.Hate to let it go but I have to slim down some how... From the web;\"The Fender Malibu SCE Acoustic-Electric Guitar features a folk-style narrow-shouldered body that rests easily on your knee for hours without stressing your right shoulder. The solid spruce top is large enough to generate serious volume with sweet and complex timbre. Crafted with Solid mahogany back, and mahogany sides, and sweet playing neck with rosewood fingerboard and uniquely designed rosewood bridge. Fishman electronics with onboard tuner let you readily play with the band. Multiple top binding and a parquetry rosette add to classy look and feel.\" I think this one is in great if not excellent shape but beauty is in the eye of the beholder so please take a good look at the pictures.
