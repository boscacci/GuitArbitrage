{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a very rare first year Peavey Wolfgang USA with an Amber Quilt Top. This guitar is very special as it has no Patent Pending stamp or Patent stamp on the back of the headstock. It also does not have a serial number! This guitar also does not have any holes drilled for the tremolo cover on the back of the guitar. Here is an incredible opportunity to own a very early and rare Peavey Wolfgang! Condition is good but it has been played so the neck has darkened a bit. The frets are very good and the guitar has been professionally set up. There are some dings on the bottom of the guitar, but overall it looks great and plays great! Comes with OHSC, which has some wear and tear but works and also comes with the 1996 Peavey Wolfgang fold out brochure.", "ItemID": "163543428456", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T20:58:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-14T16:19:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-Peavey-Wolfgang-EVH-USA-Amber-Quilt-Top-No-Patent-Pending-Stamp-Van-Halen-/163543428456", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Arlington Heights, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635434284568080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3NFg5Nzg=/z/tzkAAOSwQ3RcZZRv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5M1gxMzg3/z/aXwAAOSwkCZcZZQJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fCkAAOSwR7xcZZPk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ccUAAOSwvSNcZZPa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~zgAAOSwZFJcZZRA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1zsAAOSwpsBcZZSy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/290AAOSwTwtcZZPb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Jg0AAOSwKhFcZZTB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FXgAAOSwo~dcZZV3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzQxWDc5OA==/z/p3UAAOSwO7pcZiJv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60004", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ebmmevh", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1254, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 193}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rare Peavey Wolfgang EVH USA Amber Quilt Top No Patent Pending Stamp Van Halen", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Wolfgang USA"]}]}, "HitCount": 267, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
