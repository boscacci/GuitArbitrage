{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale today is my absolutely fabulous Gibson Les Paul Standard! I REALLY hate to see this one go, but finances are what they are\u2026 Here is the description page for the 2018 Gibson Les Paul Standard The Gibson data page for the 2018 Gibson Les Paul Standard This has a gorgeous top and a thick, creamy, rich sound! I am the first owner: it was purchased new, pre-order from my local dealer. It has only been played a little, I mostly play finger-style, but do occasionally use a pick. The pick guard and all the factory parts are included, with no alterations to the guitar. I have ONLY played this guitar in my home studio by me\u2026 It is in truly wonderful condition. I will easily call it a 9.8 out of 10 condition, as it was made by humans and played by a human. The case is in 9.8 out of 10 condition. This guitar is sold as-is. It is in great shape and has been in a good environment. However, returns are ONLY available for \u201cnot described correctly.\u201d Collectors? Do you want a 10? This isn\u2019t a 10. It is really a 9.8\u2026 SOOOOO close, but not absolutely museum perfect... SHIPPING Shipping: Shipping is actual cost (I don't add 'and handling\" to the charge). I do not participate in the eBay global shipping program . I will ship either UPS or USPS Priority Mail, whichever works best for my abilities. Shipping notes: I work a full-time job as a software engineer. Music and gear are my passions (outside my family). I list 3 days processing time because sometimes I have to do something for work, work late, do something for my family, or similar. I have to wrap up your gear at night after work and get it down to our local shipper (Office Depot) as quickly as is possible. Sometimes, I can ship out within 24 hours, sometimes it takes a couple of BUSINESS days. I really do strive hard to do a good job for you. I want you to enjoy my gear, too! Returns: I'm selling my gear to bring money into my home. I am not a business and I don't have a monetary reserve to offer multi-thousand-dollar returns.", "ItemID": "202603753442", "EndTime": "2019-02-24T20:33:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-22T03:00:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-Mojave-Burst-Super-Minty-OHSC-All-Original-/202603753442", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Elon, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2026037534428080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM4NFgxNjAw/z/yXcAAOSwL1RcZ6Mp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyM1gxNjAw/z/gIwAAOSwdfVcZ6Me/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNTE2/z/BzkAAOSwJzpcZ6Mh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjQ0/z/u6sAAOSwrw1cZ6Mk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5MlgxNjAw/z/og4AAOSwceZcZ6Mm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sKQAAOSwUR9cZ6M4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzY0/z/jQIAAOSwM7lcZ6Mr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM2MFgxNjAw/z/LxUAAOSwYqVcZ6Mv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J34AAOSwlLdcZ6My/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzcy/z/RiMAAOSwcyVcZ6M1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg2MjA=/z/F34AAOSwHGFcZ6M2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE5WDE2MDA=/z/chcAAOSwbu1cZ6Mt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27244", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jimpearsonguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1647, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 21, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1899.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1899.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***q", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 10}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Standard Mojave Burst Super Minty OHSC All Original", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Mojave Burst"]}]}, "HitCount": 300, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1924.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The guitar is easily 9.8 out of 10.
