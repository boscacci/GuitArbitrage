The guitar is loaded with a single Reeves Gabrels signature pickup, and is equipped with a Wilkinson WVS50 tremolo. It comes in your choice of three to-die-for colors: , Metallic Blue, and .\u00a0 \"what i think is cool about this guitar is the fact that i have a whole ongoing story /reason/explanation of always having a no frills simple, fast and blue thing to zip around on that threads thru my whole life. this guitar is a continuation of that sense of freedom in the form of speed and power stripped down to its essentials. and reverend guitars matched the light metallic blue color of both of its two wheeled predecessors. to me a single pickup guitar with a trem is just like my 1966 shwinn stingray with the extension spring on the front wheel or my 1971 honda dirtbike w/the raised front fender and slightly extended fork. it's a guitar with enough agility that it will let you grab air and do wheelies and the power to leave some rubber on the asphalt in front of the neighbor\u2019s house. and, really, that's all you need. did i mention it's blue?\" -Reeves Gabrels Features & Technical Specs: Body Wood:\u00a0Korina solidbody Body Color/Finish:\u00a0Metallic Blue\u00a0 Neck Wood:\u00a03-piece korina\u00a0 Neck Profile:\u00a0Medium oval\u00a0 Neck Radius:\u00a012\" Neck Joint:\u00a0Set neck Fingerboard:\u00a0Blackwood Fingerboard Inlays:\u00a0Dots Frets:\u00a022 medium jumbo\u00a0 Nut:\u00a0Boneite Nut Width:\u00a043mm Tuners:\u00a0Reverend Pin Lock Scale Length:\u00a024.75\" Bridge:\u00a0Wilkinson WVS50 IIK tremolo Pickups:\u00a0Reverend Reeves Gabrels Signature\u00a0 Controls:\u00a0Volume, Tone, Bass Contour, 3-Way Jack Location:\u00a0Side Hardware Finish:\u00a0Chrome Case: Not included Country Of Origin:\u00a0South Korea Serial Number:\u00a028690 Weight: 7.09 lbs.", "ItemID": "123480352766", "EndTime": "2018-11-16T22:57:49.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-09T22:57:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Reverend-Reeves-Gabrels-Dirtbike-Metallic-Blue-Premium-Preowned-/123480352766", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Saint Joseph, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234803527668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/dc0AAOSwzTFb5g4K/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/3EoAAOSwxG9b5g4M/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/lDwAAOSw7PJb5g4L/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/qNgAAOSwDX5b5g4N/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/zRMAAOSwhnhb5g4L/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "56374", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "riff_city_guitar", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 493, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.5, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 50, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 476.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 476.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 337}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Reverend Reeves Gabrels Dirtbike - Metallic Blue - Premium Preowned", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Reverend"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 358, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1299717446", "StoreName": "Riff City Guitar"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 481.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "SKU": "DBrmb28690", "NewBestOffer": false}
