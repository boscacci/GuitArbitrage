{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Washburn Dimebag Darrell Darbell Misprint Signature Model. There\u2019s different rumors about how many of these made it into production before the error was discovered and they were halted. I don\u2019t think there were more 2000 and that\u2019s a gross estimation. This guitar has some scuff marks as seen in photos and one of the pickups has recessed. It plays fast but the pickup does effect sound so it it\u2019s probably an easy fix but still a nice collectors item. I tried to replace the part that holds the pickups on and it didn\u2019t work: I\u2019ll be including the original and the new parts. Everything else is original. This guitar was issued in between Dimebag having been endorsed by Dean guitars. I think it\u2019s either 331 or 332 model with zebra humbucker pickups. Shipping will be costly due to the oversized case that comes free as part of the auction. All items are shipping with tracking. Sorry no international bidders due to customs laws and expenses.
