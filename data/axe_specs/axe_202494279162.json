{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson 2004 Les Paul Standard, which I believe is in the Honeyburst finish. \u00a0Looks more Honey than Heritage Cherry style to me. \u00a0 USA Serial #\u00a002894327 - Nashville, TN - Oct 15, 2004 Beautiful guitar! Ok, so what's with \"Pappy\", right? \u00a0I am not sure if this was done in the custom shop at Gibson, or by a luthier later on. \u00a0If you look at the photos closely, you can see the outline of the Gibson logo just under Pappy. \u00a0Easier to see in person. \u00a0So, a little odd, but makes it a unique piece for sure.\u00a0 Overall, It looks like a legit Les Paul to me as far as I can tell. \u00a0I have tried to check every possibly \"fake\" area on it that I know of. \u00a0Even took this by a shop and they say it's a legit USA Gibson. \u00a0 The Pickups only say \"F\" and \"R\" underneath. \u00a0No label, tag, number or anything. \u00a0 Mahogany Body & Neck, No Scarf Joint Honeyburst Finish Maple AA Flame Top Rosewood Fretboard Tune-O-Matic Bridge Stopbar Tailpiece Weight - Right at 8.6 lbs Overall very clean and looks great. \u00a0Does have a few nicks and some light scratches here and there. \u00a0I had a hard time trying to get the light scuffs to show in the photos. \u00a0But chrome is very nice and still has that super glossy Gibson look. \u00a0 One of the pots need to be replaced, since a knob tab has popped off. \u00a0Does not come with pickguard or original case. \u00a0Depending on agreed price, I may be able to work a case in! It's basically in the same shape I found it, so it could use a slight setup along with fixing the pot. \u00a0Very unique piece, hope it finds a good home! Prefer to ship within the US only, but will consider shipping internationally. \u00a0Please contact me direct for shipping quotes. \u00a0If you have any other questions, or need more photos, please let me know! \u00a0Thanks!", "ItemID": "202494279162", "EndTime": "2018-11-07T02:21:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-07T01:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-2004-Honeyburst-/202494279162", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Franklinton, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2024942791628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9lYAAOSwypZb4e7K/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aXcAAOSwTiVb4e69/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7PcAAOSwZ3pb4e7N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jaIAAOSwtaBb4e6-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tdIAAOSwzZNb4e7G/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/U~8AAOSwc1Zb4e7E/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mc0AAOSwJuZb4e7B/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7~IAAOSwcnxb4e7L/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JIEAAOSwB5lb4e7D/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nMEAAOSwrmRb4e67/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3b0AAOSwNUlb4e7H/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lMIAAOSwaalb4e7A/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "27525", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "skipperfamily5", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 9990, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 543}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Standard 2004 Honeyburst ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 0, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=27212261", "StoreName": "Broken Anchor Media"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1025.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
