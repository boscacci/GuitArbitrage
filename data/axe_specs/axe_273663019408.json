{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I purchased this Epiphone Limited Edition ES-335 Pro brand new in October 2018 and have played it lightly and only at home. It is almost MINT. However, I did sand the back of the neck a little bit (with 3M sandpaper, 2000 grit) to make it play more smoothly (the gloss finish on the neck was very sticky!). This is a very common practice especially on guitars in this price range. I didn't go too far with it and I think the guitar does play better, but I understand this affects its value (hence the \"very good\" grading and lower price). I'm attaching pics so you can see for yourself. Otherwise it's a perfect guitar, free from any scratches or dents, marks, etc. Plays and sounds incredible! Recently intonated, comes loaded with GHS boomers, 10 1/5 gauge. *** Will be available after January 17th, 2019 *** (Unless you want to pick it up before December 21st, 2018) No case, local pickup only in Manhattan, NYC.", "ItemID": "273663019408", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T23:58:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-18T17:09:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Limited-Edition-ES-335-Pro-Cherry-/273663019408", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "New York, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736630194088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XlIAAOSwcqxcGlay/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xfIAAOSwEphcGlaw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d64AAOSwm-FcGla2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BHMAAOSw99tcGlaa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GwwAAOSwt3hcGlaz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8EoAAOSwf1xcGla0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uKgAAOSwwkRcGla~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "10027", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "santiago-acosta", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 8, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 360.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 360.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***.", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 23}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["None"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Limited Edition ES-335 Pro - Cherry", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}]}, "HitCount": 38, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
