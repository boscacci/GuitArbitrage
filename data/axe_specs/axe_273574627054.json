{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Awesome guitar! You gotta love the look. I think the changed pickguard gives it some real character. As far as condition, there are a few indentions that do not go into the wood on the front mostly, however they are very hard to see and almost impossible to photograph. There is clearcoat swirling mostly on the back. There is a very small ding on the bottom (shown in a photo). Other than these very small things, a near perfect guitar. If you want to rock like Bruce Springsteen (and many others) or if you want a versatile electric guitar that can be played in many styles of music, you simply cannot beat an American-made model Fender Telecaster. This is as good as it gets in this price range. It comes with a Fender gigbag (shown in photo). ******************************************************************************TREY\u2019S AWESOME GUITARS - STORE POLICIES: AVAILABILITY: If you send me a message, I think you will find that I am very responsive; I attempt to do so. One exception is that on Saturdays, I am not available most of the day because this is my day to get away from it all, however when I return on Saturday evening, I will respond to any messages or offers. I also do not generally respond after 9pm EST any day, however I generally do respond early the next morning. DESCRIPTION OF GUITARS: I endeavor to describe guitars as accurately as possible. Most guitars have some clearcoat scratches and swirling on them; I do not generally attempt to photo these as they are very difficult to capture and generally do not accurately represent what they look like once you receive the guitar. I am very picky about pointing out imperfections and use; I very rarely classify a guitar as Mint Condition. When you get the guitar, I want you to experience satisfaction that it was exactly as described. I know I am very unhappy when I receive a guitar that was not as described. PACKAGING: I endeavor to pack up my guitars so they are safe and secure on the way to you. I cannot guarantee that the shipping company will not damage it, however I try to minimize that as much as possible. I use new or like new boxes that are heavy-duty; some boxes that are described as heavy-duty are not really. I do not prefer shipping boxes that have been folded in half, however, if I use them, I will secure the fold well. I attempt to follow all recommended guidelines in packing them up. SHIPPING: I generally say that I will ship within one (1) business day, however I try to ship as quick as possible. Many times, I ship the same day especially if I receive the order early that day. Please note, however, that I am very picky about my packaging, and I take the time required to pack it up good. If the guitar is valued over $1,000.00, it will take me a little longer as it will be insured, and I am required to take it to the Customer Center, and this is further away from my location. SATISFACTION: I definitely want you to be satisfied on your purchase. I have been selling on eBay for awhile, and thanks to my awesome customers, I have earned and maintain a 100% rating for guitars.", "ItemID": "273574627054", "EndTime": "2018-12-03T01:03:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-23T01:03:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-American-Special-Telecaster-2016-Vintage-Blonde-Excellent-Condition-/273574627054", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Johns Island, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735746270548080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/hssAAOSwgotb9yJS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg2Mjg=/z/w3cAAOSwVBVb9yJZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/26kAAOSwHhRb9yKD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/EnwAAOSwaPNb9yKK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/W2gAAOSwCPZb9yKT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NDk=/z/XNwAAOSwMKxb9yKa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/hcQAAOSwz05b9yKl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/1sEAAOSwBkNb9yKt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/16wAAOSw8Mxb9yK6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3ODI=/z/oIAAAOSwZddb9yLC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29455", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "treys-awesome-guitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 433, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 12}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender American Special Telecaster (2016), Vintage Blonde, Excellent Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Vintage Blonde"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Special"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 173, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 860.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent - see below for details.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
