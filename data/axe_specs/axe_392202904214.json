The H56/1 was released as part of the Rocket series in 1968 with two pickups, a three-way pickup switch, and four control knobs. Mostly Original. The pickguard and the volume / tone speed knobs are not original. A Great Sounding and Playing Guitar! Affordable USA Vintage Guitar! Our Luthier did a complete setup and installed new strings.

The back of the neck has a few small dents and chips as well as some cool wear marks. The Headstock has some scratches around the edges. (See pictures #7, #8). Neck is straight.
