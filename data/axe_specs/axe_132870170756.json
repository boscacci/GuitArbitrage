You are looking at a 2018 Jackson X Series Warrior WRX24. This is a Limited Edition Gloss Black with Gold Hardware Finish. Jackson's Warrior WRX24 solidbody electric guitar gives you Jackson performance and classic attitude. At the heart of the Warrior WRX24, you'll find the tried-and-true combo of hot Duncan Designed humbuckers set into a gorgeous neck through construction. Then there's Jackson's compound radius rosewood fingerboard, which gives you the perfect contour, no matter where you play on the neck. And the guitar's gold Floyd Rose Special double-locking tremolo puts unbelievable stability and control under your fingers. From The Web: Ingrained with purebred Jackson DNA, ultra-fast playability and unbelievable value, the WRX24 features a 25.5\u201d scale length, resonant mahogany body, and through-body maple neck with scarf joint and graphite reinforcement for solid stability, guarding against climate and humidity changes. Hosting 24 jumbo frets and distinctive sharkfin inlays, the bound 12\u201d-16\u201d compound-radius rosewood fingerboard curves more dramatically at the nut for easy chording and flattens out as it approaches the neck joint for low-action bends without fretting out. Dual Duncan Designed\u2122 HB-103 humbucking pickups use ceramic magnets and powerful coil windings to deliver a well-balanced high-output tone with tight bass and plenty of crunch and harmonics. The WRX24 also has single volume and tone controls, three-way toggle switching and a Floyd Rose\u00ae Special double-locking 2-point tremolo bridge system for superior string stability, sustain and dynamic tremolo action. Designed with classic style, the WRX24 is available in Gloss Black with white binding and gold hardware.Tech Specs Body Type: Solidbody Body Shape: Warrior Left-/Right-handed: Right-handed Number of Strings: 6 Body Material: Mahogany Wings Body Finish: Gloss Color: Black Neck Material: 1-piece Maple Neck-through-body Radius: 12\"-16\" compound Fingerboard Material: Rosewood Fingerboard Inlay: Pearloid Sharkfin Number of Frets: 24, Jumbo Scale Length: 25.5\" Nut Width: 1.6875\" Nut Material: Floyd Rose Locking Bridge/Tailpiece: Floyd Rose Special Double-locking 2-point Tremolo Tuners: Jackson Sealed Die-cast Neck Pickup: Seymour Duncan HB-103N Humbucker Bridge Pickup: Seymour Duncan HB-103B Humbucker Controls: 1 x volume, 1 x tone, 3-way toggle pickup switch Strings: NPS, .009-.042 Our luthier did a complete setup.
