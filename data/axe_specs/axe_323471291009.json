{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Recently had a Eddie fanboy threaten me with some frivolous BS to report me so I took down this listing to avoid a conflict but yes this is a factory black and yellow stripe Japan Fender factory paint job done in 1982 well before Eddie copyrighted his stripes in the 2000's and will stand by this being a factory finish with a money back guarantee. Don't know why someone who has no financial interest in Eddie would try to go after a small time seller like me other than try to save his multi-millionaire hero a few dollars in royalties but I'm sure Mr. you know who probably never even notices this guy's existence. Anyways lets get to this amazingly rare guitar, get it before the \"stripe national socialists get me\": This is probably the rarest and strangest Fender Squire ever made. It is a JV series with a factory, yes a factory Black and Yellow paintjob. All the parts and electronics including the pickguard are stock and correct for a 1982 JV series Squire. Still has the original buffing compound in the cavities that stock JV series strats have when they leave the factory.I have many more photos of the cavity and electronics so if you need further proof or verification that this is a factory done paint job please ask. Neck date of 9-16-82. If you get this guitar and feel its not factory in anyway in regards to the paint job I will refund you no problem.We believe this was either a employee one off or a special run for a Japanese dealer. This guitar was found in Japan and I also have the original Fender nylon gigbag I was told it sold with that I will include with the purchase.", "ItemID": "323471291009", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T04:15:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-28T01:52:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1982-Fender-JV-Squier-Stratocaster-factory-Black-and-Yellow-rare-/323471291009", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Aptos, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover", "CashOnPickup", "AmEx"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3234712910098080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4b8AAOSwZrdbLIZ6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EgMAAOSwC6xbLIaC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~m0AAOSwrzxbLIaJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NIoAAOSw~jpbLIaQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4FQAAOSw8eFbLIaY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FqgAAOSwZb5bLIag/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/v4MAAOSw3qdbLIY0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/CcgAAOSwjdpbLIY5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/yI0AAOSwvPZbLIY9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/sAcAAOSwHt5bLIY~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/B~kAAOSw0rNbLIZC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/C6EAAOSw2idbLIZE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95003", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "suckerfreegear", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 956, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1559.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1559.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "YellowShooting", "FeedbackScore": 14760}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1982 Fender JV Squier Stratocaster factory Black and Yellow rare!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black and Yellow"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1982"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Listing", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["JV"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 1856, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "In excellent condition for it's age.
