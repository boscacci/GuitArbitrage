Description *************************************************************************It is a model that was only on a year in the 1989 catalog. It is a wonderful sound in the model 30 years ago. Control is practical with tap change with rear direct switch and tone pot. Pickup is also subjective, but it is a good balance sound. Although it was planned to be replaced with emg immediately after obtaining it, the original was as it was because it was really good. We gathered information on bulletin boards in the United States, but the rear is evaluated by DIMARZIOs super distortion system and single by vintage system. I think that it is full original other than a new article genuine arm and a reflet. Because it is refleted, frets 80 to 90%, neck straight. It is a very good condition except peeling and bruising of painting corresponding to model year. Actually I do not want to let go, but I will exhibit it for equipment arrangement.************************************************************************* Payment We accept PayPal only.Please make a payment within 3 days after send my invoice.
