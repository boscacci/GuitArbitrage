The Fender HM Strat was an electric guitar produced by Fender Musical Instruments from 1988 until 1992. A relatively radical departure from Leo Fender's classic Stratocaster design, it was Fender's answer to Superstrats produced by manufacturers such as Jackson Guitars and Ibanez. HM stands for heavy metal. .ManufacturerFenderPeriod1988\u20131992ConstructionBody typeSolid, double cutNeck jointBolt-onScale25 in (635 mm), 25.15 in (639 mm)WoodsBodyBasswood, AlderNeckMapleFretboardMaple, RosewoodHardwareBridgeKahler SpyderPickup(s)H/S/S (Hum, Single, Single) single-coilor Singlehumbuckersin the bridge position,[1]The Fender HM strat was originally produced in Japan. Some sources say production started as early as 1984. Subsequently, in 1989,[2] it was produced in the United States. Some evidence indicates that assembly in the U.S. with components imported from Japan may have begun as early as 1987.First Version - The first version appeared with a distinct Strat logo in the headstock, 24 medium jumbo frets (i.e. these are thicker and wider frets), a maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard and with one of the four neck \"bolts\" (screws) off-set at the bottom of the neck to allow a more comfortable \"heel\" area for playing in the upper registers, a lighter basswood body, or occasionally alder for US made guitars). The scale length is an even 25 inches (635 mm), rather than the normal 25.5 inches (648 mm) commonly used on Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars. In addition, the Fender HM Strat had a Kahler licensed double-locking tremolo system, \"Spyder\", and Gotoh tuners, one DiMarzio humbucking H* \"Super 3\" pickup (\"H\" configuration), and sometimes two single coil pickups (S*, HSS configuration), two humbuckers, or sometimes a single additional Super Distortion, (HH configuration) and a side mounted jack socket. Kahler USA offers a detailed schematic diagram of the Kahler Spyder tremolo[3] and several (but not all) replacement parts are available.Japanese-assembled guitars have colored polyester on the bodies, and clear polyester on the necks. American-assembled HM Strats have a very hard aircraft grade urethane color and clear coats on the body, while still using polyester finish on the neck.Second Version - The US HM series stratocasters were produced in 1990 (possibly late 1988 with Japanese sourced components) and included the Strat 10-3200 (i.e. cont. strat, HSS), 10-2100 (HSS), 10-2102 (HSS), 10-2200 (1 silver sensor, H), 10-2300 (HH) and 10-2400 (H) models. All HM strat US made models had a scale length of 25.15 inches (639 mm) and a radius of 17 inches (431.8 mm).How to distinguish between Japanese and US assembled Fender HM Strats - The USA model features a DiMarzio Super 3 humbucker (hex poles) with American Standard single coils in the middle and neck, which are easily distinguishable by the red/white wires (middle) and blue/white wires (neck) that are visible while looking straight at the pickup. The Japanese models feature the more generic black/white wires on the single coils as well as a DiMarzio Super Distortion (slotted pole/flat pole combination). Moreover, the 1988 price list describes the line as merely \"H.M. Series Stratocaster\", while the 1989 price list mentions, \"U.S. H.M. Series Stratocaster\" from which one might garner that the earliest models were the Japan/US collaboration, followed by a straight USA-made model", "ItemID": "332990937294", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T00:10:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-02T00:10:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-HM-Super-Stratocaster-Kahler-DiMarzio-USA-Gotoh-American-Std-Single-Coils-/332990937294", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fullerton, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329909372948080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgzWDE2MDA=/z/JLcAAOSwIABcK~LD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE3WDE2MDA=/z/HG8AAOSwa55cK~LF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQ4WDE2MDA=/z/WSUAAOSwDEBcK~LG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjA3WDE2MDA=/z/Ua8AAOSw6jJcK~LH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/18cAAOSwZKlcK~LJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTEyWDE2MDA=/z/9icAAOSwO-hcK~LK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/8cMAAOSwZ-9cK~LM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA0OFgxNjAw/z/dxcAAOSwCXxcK~LO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/vKYAAOSwK5tcK~LQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/6qAAAOSwjlVcK~LR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/dx0AAOSwCXxcK~LT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NzM=/z/BlcAAOSwmvpcK~LV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "92835", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "analogtone", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 851, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 525.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 75}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender HM Super Stratocaster Kahler DiMarzio USA Gotoh American Std Single Coils", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red / Mahogany / Raspberry/ Marble"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["HM STRAT"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1980's"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["The Fender Logo Was Removed / Sanded Off / the Fingerboard  Appears to have Wear  and discoloration."]}]}, "HitCount": 268, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 535.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The Guitar Has Multiple Scratches,Scrapes,Scuffs ,Nicks,Dings,In ,On ,And Around The Body/Neck/ And Or Hardware.
