{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I've had this guitar for about 6 years. I bought this used so it has some scuffs and minor scratches as you would expect from normal wear, but no dents or dings. It plays great and sounds awesome for blues through a Fender Vibrolux, or any amp for that matter. I have made some upgrades to this guitar that make it play and sound amazing. The upgrades are: Replaced original tuners with Tombstone locking tunersReplaced truss rod cover with metal Union Jack (original was cracked)Replaced the nut with a Graph Tech Tusq XLReplaced bridge with Graph Tech Resomax NV2 with string saversReplaced tail piece to match Resomax bridge (Graph Tech)Replaced electronics with 50's wiring, quality caps, switch craft and CTS POTSReplaced pickups with boutique Bare Knuckles Stormy Monday set with aged coversIncludes genuine leather strap made by Ethos Custom Brands Free shipping via UPS ground to the lower US 48.
