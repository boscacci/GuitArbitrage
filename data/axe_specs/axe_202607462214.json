{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale today is the most sustaining 12-string solid-body electric guitar I have played in my life: My Gibson SG 12-String Neck-Through Limited in Cherry Finish! I REALLY hate to see this one go too, but finances are what they are\u2026 According to Gibson\u2019s own web site, there were only 75 of each color made for worldwide consumption! Here is an archive of Gibson\u2019s original description page. An archive page of the 2016 Gibson SG 12-String Neck-Through Limited release. This guitar sustains for days with a 9-ply neck through construction (like the old Firebird V). It comes with its original case, has the original tuners and case candy, and has had one change made: I installed 19:1 HipShot tuners to make fine-tuning MUCH MUCH MUCH Easier. This is a damage-free, no-modify upgrade with optional vintage-style buttons. The originals are included, so you can put them back if you don\u2019t like the HipShots (besides, the Hipshots are really nice on any guitar)! I have certainly played it over the years. So it has smudges, and little tiny pick marks (I mostly play finger-style, but do occasionally use a pick). I have ONLY played this guitar in my home studio by me\u2026 It is in truly wonderful condition. I have played it from time to time with a thin pick (Pink Floyd clickety sound, anyone?) , so it will have some light pick swirling on the pick guard. I will easily call it a 9.7 out of 10 condition, as it was made by humans and played by a human. The case is in 9.8 out of 10 condition. This guitar is sold as-is. It is in great shape and has been in a good environment. However, returns are ONLY available for \u201cnot described correctly.\u201d Collectors? Do you want a 10? This isn\u2019t a 10. It is really a 9.7\u2026 SHIPPINGShipping: Shipping is actual cost (I don't add 'and handling\" to the charge). I will ship either UPS or USPS Priority Mail, whichever works best for my abilities. This has a rosewood fingerboard: I am truly sorry, but I cannot export this item outside the 50 US states, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Shipping notes: I work a full-time job as a software engineer. Music and gear are my passions (outside my family). I list 3 days processing time because sometimes I have to do something for work, work late, do something for my family, or similar. I have to wrap up your gear at night after work and get it down to our local shipper (Office Depot) as quickly as is possible. Sometimes, I can ship out within 24 hours, sometimes it takes a couple of BUSINESS days. I really do strive hard to do a good job for you. I want you to enjoy my gear, too! Returns: I'm selling my gear to bring money into my home. I am not a business and I don't have a monetary reserve to offer multi-thousand-dollar returns.", "ItemID": "202607462214", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T07:46:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-25T01:36:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-SG-12-String-Neck-Through-Limited-Cherry-OHSC-/202607462214", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Elon, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2026074622148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/E1sAAOSwcyVcc0U-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wH8AAOSwT9lcc0U0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDI0/z/8cEAAOSwkV9cc0U3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyN1gxNjAw/z/yKkAAOSwh5Zcc0U6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/u9gAAOSw~Kpcc0U8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzcxWDE2MDA=/z/WsIAAOSwbURcc0VA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg4NzM=/z/ASYAAOSw6DNcc0VB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODc=/z/6gEAAOSwpCFcc0VE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eScAAOSwCnpcc0VG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njk1WDE2MDA=/z/4H4AAOSw~Tdcc0VH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU2OFgxNjAw/z/xVsAAOSw0Kdcc0VL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RzEAAOSwmPFcc0VM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27244", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jimpearsonguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1647, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 29, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2099.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2099.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***5", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 173}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson SG 12-String Neck-Through Limited in Cherry with OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson SG"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["12 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG 12 String Limited"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 356, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2124.11, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The guitar is easily 9.7 out of 10.
