{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "OLP by Ernie Ball MM1 in excellent shape! Not a rattlecan paint job! This was painted with House Of Kolor Urethane, tough and beautiful! No dents, dings, or scratches, minor polishing marks here and there. Genuine Floyd Rose Trem set up as EVH prefers, you can dive bomb like crazy and it stays in tune. String changes, drop tune, intonation are easy and fast. Frets have been leveled, crowned and polished, action is low and fast, no buzzes or dead spots. Neck is straight and true, truss rod functions correctly. Ernie Ball Musicman and Axis logos installed for fun and bragging rights, they have been cleared and sealed and look awesome. All electronics function as they should. Looks, plays, and sounds killer! Set up and intonated with fresh D'Addario XL10s. No issues, ready to rock, plug and play. Includes trem arm and wrenches. No case, but I pack VERY securely and ship FAST! Check my feedback and buy with confidence, players LOVE my guitars. Note: Buyers west of Colorado will receive a shipping discount. Payment must be received within 24 hours of auction ending.", "ItemID": "223409125329", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T16:48:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T13:49:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/OLP-Ernie-Ball-MM1-Axis-Wolfgang-EVH-Stripes-Floyd-Rose-Trem-Excellent-Condition-/223409125329", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "La Salle, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2234091253298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/v5QAAOSwaAtcaXoA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/X7gAAOSwYqVcaXoT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Sr0AAOSwRwxcaXor/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/r4MAAOSwN3lcaXpA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7VAAAOSwWKpcaXpO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/1w0AAOSwpCFcaXpk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/TU0AAOSwxlxcaXpz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/BjEAAOSwXlpcaXqP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/cM8AAOSwQ7lcaXqj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/pCoAAOSwaRRcaXq2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80645", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nomolarjoe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 688, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 416}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "OLP Ernie Ball MM1 Axis Wolfgang EVH Stripes Floyd Rose Trem Excellent Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["OLP"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Axis"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Purple"]}]}, "HitCount": 53, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
