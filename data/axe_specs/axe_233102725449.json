For example, when the S-1 switch is engaged, the first position activates all three pickups wired in series. Crystal clear signal from Samarian Cobalt Noiseless\u2122 single-coil pickups Nothing inhibits your creativity and expression more than unwanted noise from your gear. That's why Fender has been stocking the American Deluxe Stratocaster with noiseless pickups. The Samarian Cobalt noiseless pickup cancels hum by stacking two single coils constructed of three different Alnico magnet alloys. These pickups produce all the unmistakable power and warmth of a vintage Stratocaster, without hum or outside interference. Solid alder body Fender knows that when you pick up an American Deluxe, you aren't going to be putting it down any time soon. That's why they made the American Deluxe Strat such a comfortable and innovative guitar. The alder body offers all the comfort and spank that the Fender name is known for. It also provides a deep, warm tone that you immediately recognize as that classic Fender sound. Optimum Neck and fret-board design The Fender American Deluxe Strat has a compound radius fingerboard, allowing for effortless string bending anywhere on the neck. And, the beveled heel and modern \"C\" shape neck not only provide extreme comfort, but make it easy to reach those upper frets that scare off players that don't have such a well-designed axe. Now, no note is off-limits or hard to reach.
