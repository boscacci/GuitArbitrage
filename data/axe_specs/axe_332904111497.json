Kirk Douglas SG As the guitarist with The Roots, the beloved house band for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC, \u201cCaptain\u201d Kirk Douglas has developed a well-deserved reputation as a stellar and versatile player. From vamping a theme tune one moment to cranking out a psychedelic jam the next, then backing a major artist after the commercial break, this is one amazing player who can truly do it all. And he has always done it on a Gibson-made electric guitar. A Les Paul Goldtop, an ES-356, a black Custom Shop Les Paul with P-90s, a Byrdland archtop, and a vintage Epiphone Crestwood (damaged by Prince in a must-see musical TV moment) are among his arsenal, but one of his sexiest guitars\u2014the three-pickup Gibson SG Custom\u2014is now commemorated in the new Kirk Douglas SG from Gibson USA. The Kirk Douglas SG is as versatile as its namesake, primed to tap every tone you might need to rock out with today\u2019s demanding music. Through some inventive Gibson USA switch trickery, this three-pickup SG Custom\u2014with a trio of \u201957 Classic humbuckers for legendary PAF tones\u2014gives you single-coil sounds via its push-pull tone pots, and lets you dial in the middle pickup wherever desired thanks to the stealth blender ring disguised within its TogPot\u2122 selector switch. A vibrola tailpiece further enhances this stunning guitar\u2019s chops, and tips off the visual splendor that makes the Kirk Douglas SG such a sultry beast. The high-gloss Vintage Cherry nitrocellulose finish is a classic yet lesser-seen variation of the SG Custom of the 1960s. It is beautifully set off by acrylic pearloid block markers, a wide SG Custom headstock with multi-ply binding and split-diamond inlay, and a double-wide white pickguard. The visual pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, though, is the long gold \u201cLyre\u201d tailpiece cover engraved with Kirk\u2019s nickname\u2014\u201cCaptain\u201d\u2014and dual roses, partnered by a Kirk Douglas signature decal on the back of the headstock.

Visit your authorized Gibson USA dealer today to witness a truly remarkable, and amazingly nimble, guitar. Body and Neck The Kirk Douglas SG is made from solid Grade-A mahogany in the iconic double-horned style of the original \u201960s SG. Its thin dimensions and beveled edges are key ingredients in its legendary playing comfort, as is its slim, super-fast mahogany neck, with depths of 0.800\u201d at the 1st fret and 0.900\u201d at the 12th. Its Grade-A rosewood fingerboard carries stunning acrylic pearloid block markers, and is topped with a large Custom headstock with multi-ply binding and split-diamond inlay. Pickups and Electronics Three of Gibson\u2019s popular \u201957 Classics provide a usefully contemporary take on vintage PAF humbucker tone, with added versatility thanks to coil-splitting switching on the tone controls\u2019 push-pull pots. In addition, the TogPot\u2122 selector switch carries a blender pot within its ring, to dial in the middle pickup level to any position, as desired. All this clever wiring trickery gives the Kirk Douglas SG unseen sonic depths, while hiding within the traditional four-knob plus three-way switch control array. Hardware The hardware, all gold, includes high-quality Grover\u2122 keystone tuners, Tune-o-matic bridge, and a vibrola for added versatility, with stunning \u201cLyre\u201d cover etched with Kirk\u2019s nickname \u201cCaptain\u201d and dual roses. The guitar carries the larger white mid-\u201960s pickguard, with multi-ply headstock binding, single-ply fingerboard binding, and a traditional \u201cbell\u201d truss-rod cover.
