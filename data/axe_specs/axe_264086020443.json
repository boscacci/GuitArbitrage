{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "You are looking at a Jackson SL4X in Neon Orange. It is virtually new. Played for maybe two hours. The photos (even the ones on the music store websites) don't really catch the color of this guitar. It is NEON orange. Think traffic cone. Safety vest. It's totally beautiful and certainly eye-catching. Everything on this guitar is flawless--it plays fast and easy. Of course the Floyd Rose stays in tune. NECK THRU!!! The only bad part about these guitars is the pickups. They are truly awful unless you're using a LOT of distortion. So I replaced them with a set of Lace pickups. Red (hot humbucker) in the bridge. Silver (single coil) in the middle. Blue (vintage-y humbucker) in the neck. Now the guitar is actually useful and versatile. It can even get the Strat \"quack\" in positions 2 & 4, although it's more powerful and darker than a regular Strat. I will include the whammy bar (of course) but forgot to put it in the photos. I will also include the back trem. cover. It's kind of odd...I was trying to get it back on, but it really needs to be wedged in there. So I figured rather than screwing it up when you might not even put it back on, I'll just send it to you, and you can do what you want with it. Maybe I'll sand it down so that it fits properly. Please feel free to ask any questions. Thanks! I SHIP TO THE USA ONLY! I SHIP TO THE USA ONLY!
