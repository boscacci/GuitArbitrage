{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For Sale: My Nuno Signature Washburn N2 Description: \u2022This was bought from Andertons as a B-stock guitar a little while ago. When it arrived a Seymour Duncan '78 Model Custom Shop was put into the Bridge and a Duncan '59 Into the Neck. It was then setup by a guitar shop for me. \u2022There is a very slightly flat fret, on the treble side of the 1st between the G and B strings but otherwise plays excellently. This is how it was delivered to me by Andertons. Reason For Selling: The main reason for selling is that I am consolidating my gear and saving up for the future. My soldering has done the job just fine, but of course the pickups could be changed / re-soldered if that was what you wanted. Postage and Packaging It will be packaged in the same sturdy Andertons box and sent with a fully insured courier, likely to be DPD or Parcelforce as I find their tracking much better than others. Questions / Offers For absolutely anything Offer related or for more pictures, please just send me a message and ill get back to you as Soon as I can. Please also check my feedback!
