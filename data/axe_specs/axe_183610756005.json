{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender American Special Stratocaster Sunburst 2013 This is a really nice playing and sounding American Stratocaster. I have owned several American Standards, and this Special plays and sounds as good as any of them. It features a maple fingerboard and has a new set of D\u2019Addario 9s. The guitar has a few scratches that you would expect from a used guitar. I have tried to photograph them, but they don\u2019t show up very well. The worst one is a small scratch on the front near the end and a couple dings on the bottom edge near the strap button. This one comes with a hard roadrunner case instead of the gig bag that Specials usually come with and it has a tremolo arm. The case has a few dings, but the latches work, it has the keys with it, and still protects the guitar as it should. Shipping to lower 48 US states only.
