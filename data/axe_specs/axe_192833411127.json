The Epiphone Lucille employs most of the same tech specs but at a fraction of the price of its Gibson cousin. It features two humbucking pickups with a Vari-Tone control switch that allows you to change their sound, mono and stereo jacks, a fine-tuning adjustable bridge, two volume and two tone knobs, plus a three-way selector switch.
