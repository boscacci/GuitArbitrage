{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello :) Here I am selling this Gibson that I got a couple of months ago! Reason I\u2019m selling it is coz I need the money, and also coz I wanna Strat. Strats are just so great. Not really anything like them, and nothing beats the 2nd & 4th position on them Kiko Cibrian and Tom Misch really got me wanting one again!! (: Anyhow this Gibson is pretty great too. It\u2019s been used, so expect some wear here and there on the guitar. Nothing really wrong with the guitar except that since it\u2019s a semi hollow body guitar the electronics can move around which will in turn make either the neck pick up or bridge pickup act alittle weird. Basically it\u2019ll sound like out of phase-ish So sometimes or really a lot of times when you first take out to play that is if you travel you\u2019ll have to move around the wiring with your fingers coz I think the toggle switch wiring is alittle loose. Takes a couple seconds to fix and in my experience only happens when you have taken it out of the case after traveling but I\u2019m guessing that needs to be tightened up. Other than that it\u2019s a nice guitar that\u2019s been set up with 11 gauge strings. It will come with the case and book of authenticity. I will ship either with fedex ground or Ups ground. And I will take offers so please don\u2019t be afraid to make them :) any questions just let me know!! (: Hope the best for whoever reads this, and appreciate you looking! :)", "ItemID": "153283217025", "EndTime": "2018-12-02T21:44:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-29T21:44:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2014-Gibson-Memphis-ES-339-Studio-Sunburst-/153283217025", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Saint Cloud, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532832170258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N8AAAOSwUalcAFiu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xI4AAOSwDX5cAFj~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yPYAAOSwDPNcAFjm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G0QAAOSwQ5pcAFi2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XekAAOSwzDFcAFjr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fQkAAOSwRrlcAFjY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4XEAAOSwiqBcAFjy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R0wAAOSw9m5cAFjd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uNwAAOSw-ghcAFkj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34769", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "2011alexandertheii", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 86, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 177}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2014 Gibson Memphis ES-339 Studio Sunburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2014"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-339"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 101, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 860.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
