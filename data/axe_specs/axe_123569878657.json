{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Custom Shop Custom Classics 1958 Stratocaster in rare Burgundy Mist Metallic with beautiful Gloss Birdseye Maple C shape Neck and Gold Hardware. Guitar is in excellent shape. In just a couple years this Strat will officially be a Vintage Guitar. Built on 4/1997 this beautiful Strat was made during the John Page era, who was the founder of the Custom Shop and is considered some of the best years of Custom Shop Guitar production. This Strat was a Studio Guitar owned by British Music Producer John Porter who has produced Buddy Guy, BB King & many other greats. He is also married to Linda Keith who was Jimi Hendrix's Girlfriend who had given Jimi one of Keith Richard's Strats without telling him :-). Weighs 7 pounds 10 ounces. Comes with Tweed case (has a little wear on corners) and Whammy bar. Guitar didn\u2019t come with a COA as it was a studio guitar and paperwork and case candy were misplaced. I checked the serial number with Fender and it is correct and was told by Fender the date it was made. The pickups were professionally upgraded from Fat 50's to Vintage Noiseless pickups while still owned by John. Also please see pic with arrow which shows a very very small finish repair approximately 1/8\u201d that was professionally done while still owned by John, repair has a slight color variation and you need to look very close to see it and it is finished perfectly smooth and level.
