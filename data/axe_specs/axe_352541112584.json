{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states only FedEx,no post office boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone by Gibson SG Special in a Worn Vintage Sunburst finish with some nice upgrades. This guitar is in most excellent condition,I bought it brand new just to hot rod. I traded out the stock closed back tuners for some nice vintage style tuners that say Gibson on them but they came from China so don't get too excited[you can still see some of the screw holes left from the old tuners on the back of the headstock]. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on.Then I swapped out the stock pickups for some hot HMV Double Cream Humbuckers,they meter around 7.5k-neck, over 15k bridge. I upgraded the stock tone control with a push/pull tone control so you can split the humbuckers into single coils,and I upgraded the capacitor with a nice Japanes mylar film cap. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. Neck shows zero fret wear. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. IF YOU LEFT CLICK YOUR MOUSE ON ANY OF THE PICTURES THEY WILL ENLARGE FOR A BETTER VIEW. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.

Consider this a contract if you bid. Sorry it has to be like that,blame the clever scam artist that spend all their time trying to beat somebody,instead of working.
