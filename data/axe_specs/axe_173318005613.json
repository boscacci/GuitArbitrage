It\u2019s a vintage 1990\u2019s Japanese built Burny RSG-140 Jimmy Page double neck, built by Fernandez Guitars, an EDS-1275 clone in Heritage Cherry. A beautiful feeling and playing historically accurate reproduction of Jimmy\u2019s legendary Gibson EDS-1275. It was built to an exceptionally high standard w/near perfect accuracy. Easily as good as the Gibson but without the \u00a37k+ price tag & a high-end Burny model made only in the early 90\u2019s. Mahog body, rose fingerboards, all chrome hardware with the lower humbuckers uncovered just like Jimmy\u2019s. Necks are straight, truss rods fine, plenty of life left in the frets on both necks. No issues either electrically or structurally. Just some play wear & dust here & there. Not many of these were ever made and we only have this one. She\u2019s truly exceptionally clean & comes complete w/its original Burny/Fernandes Hard Case.
