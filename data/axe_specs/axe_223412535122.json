{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is this gorgeous sweet Stratocaster with serious upgrades. Body and neck are from an early 2000's Squier Standard Strat. Neck has been re-finished in glossy Nitrocellulose, very vintage and comfortable. Frets have been leveled, crowned and polished. Action is low, smooth and fast. This is one of the most comfortable Strat necks I've ever seen. Tuners are USA Fender, very stable. Fender USA Roller String Tree for tuning stability. Fender '62 Headstock logo, Custom Shop logo, US S series logos added for fun and authenticity, they've been cleared and sealed, and look great. (This is NOT a US Strat!) Electronics are from a 1998 MIM Fender Standard Strat, and have been upgraded with a USA Sprague Treble Bleed Circuit which prevents high end loss as the volume knob is rolled back, tone stays consistent through the volume range. The mid pickup tone control also controls the bridge pickup, ala SRV, Clapton, Mayer, Eric Johnson, etc. Very vintage tone with lots of sparkle, spank, bite and growl! Body is 1 pc. full thickness 1 3/4\" Basswood in very nice shape, some scratches on the back and sides that don't show up in the photos. The front looks great! Overall excellent shape. This Strat will blow away any current MIM Strat out, you won't find one that plays this nice for this price! Set up and intonated with fresh D'Addario XL10s, no issues, plug and play. Tremolo arm included. No case, but I pack very securely and ship FAST!! Check my feedback and bid with confidence, players love my guitars! NOTE: buyers west of CO will receive a shipping discount! Payment must be received within 24 hrs of listing ending.", "ItemID": "223412535122", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T13:01:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-21T15:40:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-Stratocaster-Major-Upgrades-Excellent-condition-Full-Size-Body-/223412535122", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "La Salle, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2234125351228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/tiIAAOSwH4lcbsD4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/H~wAAOSwWB5cbsEm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/nAgAAOSwLtBcbsFR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/2dcAAOSwWnhcbsFu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/v9YAAOSw02FcbsGI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/FcwAAOSw0TpcbsGY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/7ToAAOSwnDRcbsG2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/EHAAAOSw24hcbsHL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/NnAAAOSwqrVcbsH2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80645", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nomolarjoe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 688, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 245.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 245.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender/ Squier Stratocaster Major Upgrades Excellent condition!
