{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a 1996 Parker Fly Deluxe. I am the original owner. I purchased this guitar in 1996 from Guitar Center. For several years it was on a stand in the living room only picked up when I wanted to practice. The rest of the time it was in the case. It\u2019s never been gigged. I need to raise some cash so I\u2019m selling off a few guitars from my collection. About the guitar: It\u2019s metallic dark green and is totally original. Nothing has been modified. It\u2019s in excellent condition except for a few small chips on the edges and a small ding (see photos). The paint has some very very faint swirls but in excellent shape. The frets and fretboard are near mint and straight. No signs of wear. Everything works perfect.It has 9V active electronics, Parker locking whammy bar system incredibly light, amazingly resonant poplar/basswood carved body and neck, carbon fiber exoskeleton, locking Sperzel machine heads, stereo output (so you can route the magnetic and piezo pickups to different amps if desired) and a beautiful dark metallic green finish. Comes with whammy bar, stereo cable, wrench set, original manual, spare spring plate and original Parker soft case. Please ask questions. Perfect seller feedback so buy with confidence.", "ItemID": "123598361802", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T11:14:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-17T00:14:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1996-Parker-Fly-Deluxe-Guitar-USA-Metallic-Dark-Green-W-Case-/123598361802", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pollock Pines, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235983618028080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/~0AAAOSwTxJcP77R/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY1/z/DoMAAOSwYPNcP77Q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/IA0AAOSwcttcP76-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/69QAAOSwvrJcP76-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/J4sAAOSwMpFcP766/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/PIgAAOSwe~lcP8FY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/AJsAAOSw~5dcP762/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/AmEAAOSwY4JcP765/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/e94AAOSwolpcP765/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/fI4AAOSwwkRcP76y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/al0AAOSwNBJcP77P/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NVgxNjAw/z/3E0AAOSw851cP8AV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "95726", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bob4gets", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 232, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1549.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1549.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 62}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1996 Parker Fly Deluxe Guitar USA Metallic Dark Green \u00a0W/ Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Parker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Fly"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 679, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
