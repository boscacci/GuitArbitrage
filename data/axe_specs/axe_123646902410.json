{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For your consideration is a gently used Sweetwater Limited Edition USA Fender Sandblasted Stratocaster, fully upgraded, hot-rodded, and customized. I fell in love with the Fender Sandblasted guitars back in 2015 and love to mod them even more. Baby number 2 is on the way, so although it\u2019s not a dire sale, the wife is kindly asking to thin the herd (just a little) in preparation. The guitar itself is in excellent to near mint condition. I only found one very faint surface scratch, which was hard to catch in most lights and angles, especially on this finish. It\u2019s on the front, just above the pickguard, above the neck pickup. Although barely visible, just wanted to document the small blemish. Below is rundown of specs/upgrades on this particular guitar.
