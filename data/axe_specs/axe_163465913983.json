{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "US Buyers: No taxes, duties or brokerage fees Guitar comes with OHSC in excellent condition, signed checklist, warranty card and original truss rod cover Besides some very light surface swirling / scratches mostly invisible on the pictures the guitar is mint. These 2016 \"Proprietary Run\" guitars are limited-edition models with a vintage-style vibe, but devoid of more expensive Custom shop specs. Still, they manage to have a more vintage-like vibe than the modern Les Paul Standards: no fancy figured maple tops here, the plain top is more in keeping with the original 1950's guitars. Also, they feature open, PAF-style '57 Classic humbuckers. The only noticeable nod to modernity is that they have chambered bodies for weight relief, but that shouldn't bother most players - on the contrary! Visually and tonally, these are the most vintage-style Les Pauls outside the Custom Shop zone, but whereas the Custom Shop models are often built to look \"aged\", the Les Paul Classics look like the original Les Paul guitars would have looked when Clapton and all those great guitarists first bought theirs in the early Sixties - mint, and ready to set the world on fire! They are serious contenders for coolest Les Pauls right now...
