{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Truly unique - and rare.One of a limited run of 65(!)Hagstrom's Patch 2000 system was the first production instrument with a built-in synthesizer interface.Built on the Swede and Super Swede - partnered with Ampeg - a very limited number of Patch 2000 guitars and basses were constructed between 1977 and 1979, (with the 6-string version the more common with a total production run of 172.) This is ancient tech. In decent condition - considering the mileage. One scar, about 2-1/2\" on the face, south of the controls.There is also a ding (sm. crater!) near the bass side bridge mount. DOES NOT include the pedals, cables or synth needed to utilize the Patch 2000 system.(Considerable) electronics are intact and (presumably) functional.Pick-ups and harness, controls, etc. fully functional (and sound great!)Neck is straight and true with NO dead spots or rattles.It is a dream to play. (If yer arms are long enough!) Scale length = 31\" I've changed (only!) the volume/tone control knobs and have the (damaged) originals.Pick-up rings damaged, need replaced. ReferenceWiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swede_Patch_2000 Video demonstration of full Patch 2000 system:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca9GHshr3zE NoticeDamaged in shipment (Pick-up select switch): 2004Area of top, near switch, repaired, refinished, (professional quality) and switch replaced. Should I mention...The body is solid, real mahogany - so it weighs a ton! (In the day, players would mount these on stands, rather than on a strap.)The finish is clear overall with a shine, (despite the blemishes listed,) and the woodgrain highlights - front & back - shift and shimmer when held in direct light. No, they don't make them like this anymore.
