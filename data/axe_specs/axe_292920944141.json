{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Relic Les Paul Jr. double cut yellow project. This guitar was made in Asia ... even though it has the name of another American company on the headstock. It most definitely is NOT an original ...but a very well made copy. I bought it to do a relic project and was pleasantly surprised at how well built , playable and how good the guitar actually sounded. The body and neck are Mahogany , the tuners and all hardware work well and the P90 pickup sounds pretty damn good. That being said , I got about half way through the relicing , and got an offer I couldn't refuse on another guitar ...so , really just have no time to finish this one up.You can continue destroying the finish to your liking? Or , just spend a few hours putting the guitar back together and have a real , cool player. No case , but will be packed very well. Feel free to ask any questions !No Reserve! GOOD LUCK!", "ItemID": "292920944141", "EndTime": "2019-01-22T22:12:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-15T22:12:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Relic-Les-Paul-Jr-double-cut-yellow-project-ready-reassemble-NR-/292920944141", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Los Angeles, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929209441418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZqcAAOSw8bpcPll1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9c0AAOSwLKhcPll3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dCgAAOSwQXlcPll7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/t~sAAOSwtpJcPlmA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/E04AAOSwgadcPlmF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/070AAOSwCCRcPlmM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90046", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jiffypop2000", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2154, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 157.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 157.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 394}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Relic Les Paul Jr.  double cut yellow project  ready to reassemble NR", "HitCount": 760, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 160.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
