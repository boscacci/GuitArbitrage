{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a 1975 Gibson Flying V in a factory original Natural finish. This guitar is in very good condition and has light playwear. The finish is clean with just a few light marks on the top, back and sides - see pics. There's a slight finish crack on the back of the neck, about 1 inch long - barely visible. The pots date to the 17th week of 1975 and the pickups are the original Gibson Patent Number humbuckers. Grovers were added. The neck is a 60's slim taper and she weighs 7.1 lbs on a digital scale. It has just been deep cleaned and detailed. The frets were polished and the fingerboard was cleaned, buffed and moisturized with an instrument grade lemon oil. It was set up with 10/46's, adjusted and plays very nicely. All the electronics work as they should. Please look at all 50+ pictures- they accurately represent the condition of this instrument. Comes with the original, but a bit beat up Gibson hardshell case as seen in the pictures.. This guitar will be safely packed and shipped.
