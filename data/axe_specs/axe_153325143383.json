Please examine all pictures and ask any questions prior to bidding. Only item shown in pictures are included in this sale. All our shipping prices include a handling fee as we use liberal amounts of shipping materials such as bubble wrap, styrofoam and packing tape. Items are also double boxed when warranted to protect the items from any possible damage. This does, however, add to the size and weight which increases the shipping fee. Our shipping rates are based upon dimensional weight which reflects the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight and it's destination. This is how Fedex rates are calculated. Rates are based upon how much space in the truck a package takes up. Therefore, the larger the package the higher the rates even if the package is light. Local Pick-Up is always welcome. If you want to pick up item please do not pay until we send an invoice and we only accept cash upon pick up. We are committed to getting the item to you safely and in the condition you see in the photos. We only offer international shipping through eBay's Global Shipping Program. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or problems prior to leaving any negative feedback. Our goal is 100% customer satisfaction and we truly care that you be happy with your purchases Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "153325143383", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T21:03:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T21:03:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1970s-Epiphone-Crestwood-ET-275-Electric-Guitar-Case-/153325143383", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Toms River, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533251433838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/OfIAAOSw2xlcK9S0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/rFEAAOSwjfpcK9S3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/cbIAAOSwN5hcK9S6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/GDIAAOSwMg5cK9S9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/rL8AAOSwUPVcK9Tg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/M4AAAOSwC45cK9T5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/PcEAAOSwm-FcK9UA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/WBIAAOSwgbdcK9UI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/t24AAOSwdHpcK9UP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/qZAAAOSwoEFcK9TO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/CUEAAOSwdRFcK9TR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "08753", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pattit0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2575, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1970's Epiphone Crestwood ET-275 Electric Guitar with Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 289, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "RU", "DO", "SV", "IT", "VE", "CL", "CO", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Case has a lot wear.
