{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Rare ORIGINAL black HAGSTROM Swede Bass (not Chinese retros), made in Sweden in 1974-75. Most likely 1975 because it is number 390 of 500 made.Be careful some sell the chinese versions as \"Vintage\" which is in my opinion misleading. It is in good overall condition considering the age, it has some blemishes, buckle rash some dents and scratches as you would expect from a vintage instrument (please scrutinize the pictures and again ask questions when in doubt)I do my best to describe and photograph my items - if you have not asked any questions, we assume you have NONE and accept the item as pictured! Almost 100% original, two knobs are missing the Tone and Volume insert. Electronics work well, the potentiometers are almost scratch free (VERY UNUSUAL FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS). If you want an original HAGSTROM bass made in Sweden in nice original condition this is the one to buy. This instrument is a heavy but Powerfull thing, with great vintage sound.
