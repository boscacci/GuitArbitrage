{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I absolutely love this guitar but circumstances forces sale. This a genuine 1976 Vintage Gibson Les Paul Model Deluxe featured in Tobacco Sunburst. Amazing condition considering it is nearly 43 years old. Serial number 00 134### indicating it was made in 1976. Even has the original Norlin tag and the Gibson transport certificate. No major nicks or scratches. This guitar belonged to a member of a traveling band in the 70\u2019a and 80\u2019s and its amazing inside the case I even found some old musician notes of song titles they played in the early 80\u2019s. Plays very well. Wood is in great condition with excellent finish. 3 piece neck construction. (See photographs). The tuners were changed to expensive West German made Schallers sometime in the 80\u2019s by the original owner. As the original Gibson ones are notorious for getting out of tune. The case has a well traveled patina and is missing the handle as well as some vinyl damage. Minor considering the main point is the guitar itself. Would make a wonderful gift for any musician or simply a great addition to your collection. Good luck on your bids and happy holidays to all! The guitar and box will be crated and shipped to protect it I will build a wooden crate. Hence the modest price for shipping and handling.", "ItemID": "283290794874", "EndTime": "2018-12-12T20:15:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T20:15:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1976-Gibson-Les-Paul-Deluxe-Tobacco-Sunburst-Amazing-Condition-USA-/283290794874", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kailua Kona, Hawaii", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832907948748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/E-0AAOSwAzxcBdq8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/z9cAAOSwEcxcBdrX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/R6AAAOSwfgRcBdrN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rM0AAOSwzThcBdrK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CnEAAOSwjrFcBdrA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ymkAAOSwfX9cB30b/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HAYAAOSwm-FcBdrS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2zAAAOSwus5cB3zi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/56sAAOSwIw1cB3zD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/giYAAOSwRfxcBds5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YIkAAOSwg5FcBds0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xdUAAOSwgbdcBdsw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "96740", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "vanderkronen", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 67, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 15}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1976 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Tobacco Sunburst Amazing Condition!
