{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar is being relisted. The buyer had \"buyer's remorse\". Please be sure when you bid that you want it as it cost me $100 to ship this guitar to and from NJ. I'm not a company. I retired at the end of 2014 with a guitar collection of around 60 and have been selling them off. I do not play guitar, beginner or otherwise, I just collected the finest examples I could find at the time. I've had all of my guitars for at least 18 years just being stored and only once taken out of their case when I had a guitar exhibit in Mongolia otherwise unplayed in the case. Please see my other auction for a Gibson Sonex 180 Deluxe in the same condition. I only use my cellphone camera and have no talent for setting up pictures. If you require different angles let me know and I'll supply them. You can see some (hardly) paint checking just from being old but I couldn't get a picture because it's that hard to see. I see one slight worming place on the back but no chips on the headstock. It's literally been it's it's case it's whole life from what I can tell because no, none, no wear marks anywhere on the back or anywhere else. The case is old but functional. I include a page (sales picture) from October 1984 \"Guitar Magazine\", regarding the Designer Series. Low starting price.... read my feedback and I've been an Ebay member since 98 and not a commercial seller. Do your research. Mine is the best one on Reverb or Ebay, and none not nearly as nice as this one.", "ItemID": "192724129651", "EndTime": "2018-11-24T22:02:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T22:02:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Flying-V-Designer-Series-1984-NO-RESERVE-/192724129651", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Saint Augustine, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927241296518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eWIAAOSwNmxbx5hC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iuIAAOSw-2hbx5hM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZLQAAOSw53hbx5hW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2~gAAOSwlxxbx5hm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MXAAAOSwmBhbx5hv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VucAAOSwJr1bx5h9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7UcAAOSw5qdbx5iG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4IMAAOSwoDlbx5iX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8-4AAOSwRNhbx5ii/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/w5cAAOSwZtRbx5it/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/77IAAOSwJ6Nbx5i4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "32080", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bobaroo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 509, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 949.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 949.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 561}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Flying V Designer Series - 1984 - NO RESERVE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Flying V"]}]}, "HitCount": 457, "Subtitle": "Almost mint condition - Selling off collection - ", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 959.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "I hate placing \"Used\" as condition, this one is damn near mint*** All Original***", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
