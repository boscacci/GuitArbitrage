{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "THIS is 2002 Gibson Firbird in luscious Arctic White finish, that has that nice creamy look which comes naturally to this finish. It is in excellent shape over all with no major dings or scratches, but does have a few hard-to-see finish cracks running parallel with the strings on the lower 'wing' and between the pickups; the finish is totally stable and like I say, you have to really look for these at the right angle to see (see photos). Neck-through construction to provide that great sustain and vibe the 'Birds are known for. Don't know the weight but it is no Les Paul as far as that goes--I would guess it is somewhere between Les Paul and SG in weight. The marks on the pickups are just smudges--the covers are not scratched. Great, articulate sounding pickups and the bridge is the original body-mounted ABR type--not the steel studs used on the Nashville bridges--and I think this adds to the sustain and tone as a result, in my opinion. Neck is fairly thin, standard slim-taper in feel, and is so easy to play but not too thin. Fret wear is quite minimal. Original banjo-type keystone tuners on the headstock, which work very well and hold pitch. Man o' man I hate to let this gorgeous beauty go...but I gotta. Comes with the original case that you can nap in between sets! No smoky smell in the guitar or the case, either. NOTE: Due to the rosewood content, this instrument can only ship in the USA per CITES export restrictions.", "ItemID": "302954270205", "EndTime": "2018-11-18T16:03:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T16:03:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2002-Gibson-Firebird-Arctic-White-BEAUTIFUL-w-case-ec-/302954270205", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029542702058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA4WDEwODE=/z/5zIAAOSwQIFb6E7~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA2WDEwNzg=/z/IWcAAOSwwSJb6E8H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA1WDYwMw==/z/ElEAAOSwEKxb6E8I/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA1WDYwNQ==/z/NpEAAOSwjt1b6E8P/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODEwWDYwOA==/z/Gh0AAOSwYj9b6E8V/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA4WDYwMw==/z/aZcAAOSwL4Rb6E8Y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA5WDYwNg==/z/LhcAAOSw9ipb6E8a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAxWDYwMA==/z/X40AAOSwVoVb6E8f/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA4WDYwNw==/z/EngAAOSwEKxb6E8i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/74sAAOSwN3Nb6E8q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA3WDYwNQ==/z/utUAAOSwzDFb6E8r/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/orEAAOSw~-Zb6E86/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "45206", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "belinda883", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 503, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 8, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 74}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2002 Gibson Firebird, Arctic White, BEAUTIFUL!, w/case, ec", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 452, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
