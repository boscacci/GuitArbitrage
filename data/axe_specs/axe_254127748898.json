About Gibson's copy model in Japan, it changed from Orville in the 1990's to Epiphone Japan. It has a formal license from Gibson, we can dignifiedly say \"Les Paul\". Both Orville and Epiphone are produced by Fujigen in japan. As you all know, Epiphone in recent years is produced outside of Japan such as China and Korea. This is made in Japan. Made in japan of Epiphone is very popular in japan. Especialy the Lemon drop color and tiger flame maple top. There are many similar Epiphones made in China and Korea, but Japanese-made things do not seem too much in japanese used guitars market. I can say the Lemon drop color and tiger flame maple top model of made in japan is especialy rare model. Unfortunately, Japanese-made Epiphone is not currently being made. The biggest difference is the shape of the head. It is called \"Gibson head\", it is unique to Japan. Making is very polite, and neck joint is deep. You can feel a made in Japan.
