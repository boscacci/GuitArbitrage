{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A doubleneck almost squeezed into a single neck footprint, this flip-it-over combo of a 6-string guitar and a 4-string bass is handy for looper artists and other multi-instrumentalists. Everything works and sounds OK, though I think the bass pickups could be more powerful. Generally in excellent cosmetic condition, but the bottom horns are scuffed up from the guitar standing up on the floor (it's easy to prop up against a wall or amplifier), and the headstock has a low ceiling ding. There may be other, minor scratches and dings, but nothing folks will notice onstage. The plastic covers on the electronics cavities look scratched in the pictures, but that's because they still have their own removable sheet of plastic over them. Now, in my opinion this guitar takes a little getting used to. You'll probably need to adjust your fret hand position, especially when playing the first few frets of the bass, where the back of the guitar tuners are a little closer than the rest of its neck. Those with good classical fretting hand position will probably adapt the most easily, otherwise you may need to stretch your fingers backwards for those lower bass frets. If you like to fret guitar notes with your thumb, this may not work unless your hands are proportioned just right to slip far enough in between the necks. I also think the designers made a mistake inasmuch as the controls for the side you are currently playing will be on the bottom edge rather on top or on the front. There are separate plugins for each side. This is handy to play through separate amps or channels, but you may have to figure out cable management issues. I'd recommend right angle cables, so you can still stand the guitar upright to take a break or grab another instrument. So cool instrument and something to thrill an audience (hey, you turned your bass into a guitar!), but the design leaves a few kinks to be worked out. If I were to mod it, I'd upgrade the pickups and tuners, and reverse the locations of those controls. Maybe splash some dayglow paint on the fronts. Seriously, I was considering all of this, but my house is too crowded with guitars and projects. \ud83d\ude03 If I were to buy another, I'd personally try the variations with Steinberger style tuners and/or the single neck with fretboards on each side. A straight shape might be easier to get into some conventional gig bag, as well! All that said, there is a guy on Youtube who manages to be pretty much a virtuoso on these things. Also, now that I have it in my hands again, I'm starting to think of new tricks, like maybe hammering on a few notes here and there on the backside while playing the front... Could be a whole new thing! No partial refunds. No returns on international orders due to the distances and costs, so shipping abroad is at your own risk. Shipping cost is a little high as it is, as this will require the larger guitar box. No case included - lol, good luck finding one!
