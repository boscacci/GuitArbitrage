{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson ES 335 Custom Shop 2011 UsedThis is a beautiful guitar in perfect condition. Up for sale is my 2011 Gibson ES 335 Antique Natural Quilted Flame top sides and back and cream binding. Neck is slim taper. This beautiful Gibson Custom Shop instrument is in excellent condition with essentially no wear. I purchased this guitar new, and I have taken extremely good care of it since. It is in stock condition with '57 Classic PAF humbuckers, which sound great. It weighs 9 lbs. The action is low, it plays like a dream, and the tone is pure Gibson semi-hollow body. I have never played this guitar at a gig or outside of my music room. The original Gibson Historic case is included with the certificate of authenticity, the case candy, and hang tags pictured. This is an outstanding Gibson guitar and I truly believe that you will enjoy it as much as I have. Please let me know if you have any questions. Frets 98 to 100% remains. Neck condition is also good.
