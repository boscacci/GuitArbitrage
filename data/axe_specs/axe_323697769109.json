{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a Gibson 2013 Les Paul Studio in Vintage Sunburst. This beauty has a gorgeous glossy top, with satin sides and back. She has all Gold hardware, which is in excellent condition. The body of the guitar itself is also in fantastic condition, with a few light worm marks on the back which are very difficult to see. There is also a scratch on the lower bout of the body. I have done my very best to show all blemishes in the pictures provided. For electronics, this girl is wired with 490R (rhythm) and 498T (treble) pickups. These \"Modern Classic\" pickups feature tonal characteristics similar to the '57 Classic, but deliver a slight increase in the upper mids, for a more contemporary humbucking sound. The pickups also split, for that single coil sound to deliver awesome bright cleans. The neck is fast, and frets dont have those annoying nibs. You're going to love the fast play you'll get out of this one. Ill eat shipping on this beauty. She has a nice clean, beautiful top. Goal is to find her a good home. She comes shipped in an SKB case with case candy, and will be packed with care for your ease of mind. Buy her, you wont regret it!", "ItemID": "323697769109", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T20:02:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-16T21:19:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-2013-Les-Paul-Studio-Vintage-Sunburst-Electric-Guitar-/323697769109", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Surprise, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236977691098080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z9EAAOSw5k1caH34/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6dsAAOSwHOtcaH39/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/80QAAOSwaEZcaH32/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/17UAAOSwZGJcaH3z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JAcAAOSwYpVcaH4A/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lmMAAOSwbURcaH31/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wOUAAOSwMnZcaH3~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VTcAAOSwsq1caH36/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ngoAAOSwBlRcaH37/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "85387", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "the1jj602", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 189, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 775.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 775.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1197}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson 2013 Les Paul Studio - Vintage Sunburst Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["studio"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 231, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
