{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Danelectro U3 in Sparkle Aqua Bluein very nice condition i am selling all of my Sparkle Dano's Condition is very nice - i'd place it in the 9/10 area - very nice guitar overallfrets are nice and just polishedstrings are new Ernie Ball Slinky 10'saction is great and guitar is all stock anf ready for anything you can throw at it I have a bunch of Sparkle Dano's so check them out - and keep in mind these are the BIG FLAKE SPARKLES not just metallic paint (there is a major difference)this is a U3 and has 3 lipstick pickups with 6 way Rotary (Varitone) switch for many configurations and the toggle is called a \"Blow Valve\" which engages all three pick upsI am told this was a Korean made guitar. The guitar is in excellent condition everything works perfect and it plays awesome. The Selcto-Matic pickup selector switch gives you all combinations for the 3 pickups- which sound incredible. have owed several new, old, original and reissue Danelectros and the U3's and the DC 3\u2019s is in my opinion by far the best. The Korean made reissues are the best quality Danelectro made to date.", "ItemID": "273624722784", "EndTime": "2018-12-28T19:10:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T14:54:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/SALE-Danelectro-U3-1990s-Sparkle-Blue-Aqua-56-Re-issue-guitar-Korean-Made-/273624722784", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Nutley, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736247227848080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Oy8AAOSwPrtb8dz~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6N8AAOSwAx9b8dz5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N68AAOSwWH1b8dz9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iEYAAOSwzZNb8dzu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z1kAAOSwkvtb8dz7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zLwAAOSwkitb8dz1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vtsAAOSwDEBb8dzx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WDIAAOSwBMpb8d0E/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tFMAAOSws2Rb8d0H/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qOoAAOSwZupb8dz3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BpsAAOSw5cZb8d0A/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3S0AAOSwX0db8d0C/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07110", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "uncle-jesse*s-garage", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1544, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 429.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 429.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 128}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "BD", "BN", "EG", "GG", "GI", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MV", "OM", "PK", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "SALE Danelectro U3 1990's Sparkle Blue Aqua '56 Re-issue guitar Korean Made ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Danelectro"]}]}, "HitCount": 40, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
