{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered for your consideration is an extremely fine example of one of Leo\u2019s best! I am the second owner of this beautiful guitar which was bought new on 8-20-1990 & is in excellent condition. It was played for a few months by the original owner & stored until I purchased it. I have played it very little also as I am more of a collector than player. The case is in like new condition with no issues. The guitar has two very small indentations. One on the back & one on the top, back edge of the body that are hardly noticeable. There is some minimal, faint lacquer checking on the body and some pick feathering on the pickguard. There is no buckle rash. The neck is arrow straight & has no playing issues what so ever. The frets are in like new condition. The fret board is maple & has a 12\u201d radius. The guitar weighs in at 8.2#. As shown in the pictures, it has the unique sickle shaped headstock with locking tuners. This is one sweet guitar & will make a great addition to anyone\u2019s arsenal! You will not be disappointed! If you require any additional information, let me know. Thanks!
