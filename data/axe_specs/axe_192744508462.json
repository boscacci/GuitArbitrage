{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a 1980 Ibanez AR100 electric guitar. The heel joint was cracked and repaired. The joint had a clean partial separation into which Titebond was injected and clamped. Its a strong repair and aligned properly. The guitar appears to be completely original. One of the control knobs is missing it\u2019s rubber ring. Overall, the guitar is in good playing shape. The action is pretty low and the neck profile is medium. The neck is straight and truss rod functions as it should. The frets are in great shape showing only very minor wear. All electronics are checked and sound great. V2 pickups. Gig bag included. I will ship well packaged in a proper box. Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "192744508462", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T12:35:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-01T22:47:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980-Ibanez-Japan-Artist-AR100-Electric-Guitar-Black-/192744508462", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927445084628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TC8AAOSwscda1AMH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/S2YAAOSwHBda1AMI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sgwAAOSw4NZa1AMK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-asAAOSwpeFa1AMN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9EkAAOSwqlha1AMP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xCwAAOSwMD5a1AMQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TkgAAOSwGh5a1AMS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/w5UAAOSw-Y9a1AMy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RKMAAOSw8NNa1AMY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BykAAOSw6qpa1AMT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AagAAOSwDCxa1AMV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HeoAAOSwLRla1AMW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6861, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 480.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 480.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***-", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 25}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980 Ibanez Japan Artist AR100 Electric Guitar Black", "HitCount": 2514, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
