Solid Mahogany body, Quilted Maple top finished in beautiful Antique Amber with gorgeous Maple binding. Maple neck-through design, Rosewood fretboard and unbelievable \"Vine of Life\" Abalone inlay.This listing comes with a aftermarket hard case ( Stand not included ) Okay... I wish I could tell you more specifics about this guitar however, I am not a guitar guy or musician. Based on a little online research, the serial number suggested manufactured 2002. In addition, I am not the original owner of the guitar so I don't know the history of it. There may be various surface imperfections, scratches, small nicks you may find. Please examine the guitar body and zoom in on the detailed photos we provided. Ebay only allows 12 photos so we attempted to take the correct angles. There may be additional blemishes, dings and scratches but nothing major. This item has been tested and working... But may need a set-up by a professional upon receiving, such as a tuned up, tightened, cleaned, and or adjusted to your liking. It's not as bad as it seems, I just want anyone who buys it to be aware this is a vintage guitar. It may not.. could be to your liking right of the go, but just in case.... It has been sitting in its case these past 2 years unplayed in a non smoking, climate controlled room.
