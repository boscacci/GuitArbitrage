{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This guitar looks, plays and sounds AMAZING......in fact, it was built SO good that ESP discontinued this line in 2013 because it was so close to their $5000 custom shop guitars in quality and sound. It was then replaced by the overpriced E-II series that is clearly inferior to this model as you will find on discussion boards all over the internet confirming this. I bought this guitar to keep as a spare and stored it at home as I anticipated the need for a 3rd ESP guitar for touring down the road. Unfortunately, my touring plans have changed greatly and my current guitar collection is more than enough. I have less then 30 hours playing time on this guitar and it did not come with a case however I will be shipping it in a case as I don't feel comfortable shipping this in a box. The case looks terrible as it is my main case for travel but does a great job protecting the guitar. I purposely allow my guitar cases to get scratched up as to detract potential theft but do not be alarmed as this case does not reflect the actual use of the guitar. In fact, I only brought this guitar with me to 3 shows since buying it. I guarantee you will be BLOWN away with guitar and it's sad so see her go but times are tough and I can't afford to keep a guitar I don't ever use. This guitar is also incredibly light while maintaining excellent sustain and bottom end.
