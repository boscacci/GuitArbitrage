{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Item Description For your consideration is a 1998 Carvin DC 200 The guitar has been played and shows wear: scratches, dents, chip, rash, fret wear and other marks (see big pictures). The nut has been replaced and some chipping around the neck area has occurred. The frets show minor wear. The guitar has Ebony fretboard with side markers only. The tremolo has been upgraded to a Wilkinson VS100. The tremolo is in close to brand new condition. The original posts are still in the guitar but I will include the new ones from the VS100. The Sperzel are dirty on the outside but work with no issues just need to clean them. The original case shows wear and the plastic is a little wavy. The case still does the job of protecting the guitar. The electronics are comprised of a volume (push/pull active/passive switch), tone (for passive mode), treble & bass cut/boost (for active mode). There are also mini-toggles for coil splitting on each pickup, and a phase switch. The active preamp is powered by a 9v battery but you can play in normal passive mode instead, as desired. The guitar weighs 8 LBS \u2013 0.8 Ounces Payment Policy Immediate Payment is required after the Winning Bid Item will be shipped immediately on the same or next business day of receiving full payment Shipping Policy International buyers you are responsible for your countries custom duty fees and taxes Paypal Confirmed Addresses Only Please message me for a price quote for shipping to a different country Returns Policy Actual Images of item are shown BELOW NO RETURNS are Accepted for this Listing Unless Item Arrives Damaged I try to do my best to describe the guitar so the buyer has no surprises.
