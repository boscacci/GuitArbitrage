{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a 1984 Gibson Les Paul Studio Standard with a non original case. This guitar is in good condition and in perfect working order. There are some scratches, dings, finish checking, wear on the back, and (4) extra screw holes around the truss rod cover. Overall, I would give it a solid 7.5 out of 10 condition. With exception to the pickups, bridge and frets everything on the guitar is original. There are no cracks, repairs, or issues. The neck is straight with no issues. The non original frets are in excellent condition with no wear. The non original case works great.
