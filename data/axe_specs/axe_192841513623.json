This smaller-body, semi-hollow guitar has great vintage sound and is remarkably comfortable to play! Now the Wildkat is new again. The stunning Wildkat Royale has been outfitted with a pearl white finish, gold sparkle binding, and gold hardware to make a guitar totally unlike anything Epiphone has offered before.Epiphone is a leader in archtop design and has been since the 1930s. An early pioneer in archtops even before they were electrified, Epiphone was never afraid to do something out of the ordinary. With no notable changes in archtop design by anybody in decades, Epiphone took the archtop and practically married it to a solid body guitar. And with a sharp new look, the Wildkat Royale now takes its place among Epiphones all-time great designs.The Wildkat Royale\u2019s innovative design starts with a solid piece of warm, sustain-rich mahogany that is computer-routed to create an acoustic guitar-like body except with a \u201ccenter block\u201d area like an ES-335. The body is then covered with a beautiful pearl white finish with gold sparkle binding and gold hardware to create a semi-hollow body masterpiece. The Wildkat Royale\u2019s mahogany body is matched with a hand-fitted, glued-in maple neck for maximum tone and sustain. It features a rosewood fingerboard and an authentic gold B70 licensed Bigsby vibrato for even more sonic versatility. The vintage voice of this \u2018Kat comes from a pair of Epiphone gold \"dog ear\" P- 90 Classic pickups specifically designed by Epiphone.Other appointments include the historic metal Epiphone name \u201cbadge\u201d on the headstock as well as a unique control configuration of 1-bridge volume, 1-neck volume, 1-master tone and 1-master volume. These controls are powered by Epiphone\u2019s full-size 1\u201d 500K potentiometers and matched with Epiphone\u2019s superior all-metal toggle switch and heavy-duty output jack.The Wildkat Royale also features premium 16:1 Grover machine heads for superior tuning stability. All of this great design comes together with fabulous vintage semi-hollow tone and great sustain plus, being slightly larger than a Les Paul and smaller than an ES-335 size, its lightweight and really comfortable to play!
