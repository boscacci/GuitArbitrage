{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "*** Please read first: People are asking me why the shipping cost is so high. It isn't. It's not what I'm going to charge. I haven't packed it up yet, so I don't know how much it is going to cost to ship it. I'm not going to pack it up at all if it doesn't sell, so I can't give an accurate shipping cost until the auction has ended. But I promise, 100%, that I will not charge more than the carrier charges me to send it to you. **** *********************************** US Buyers only ************************************* Beautiful red flamed maple, great looking and sounding Dearmond M72, complete with original pickguard. Made in Korea, comes with Dearmond USA Gold Tone humbuckers. Straight neck, sounds fantastic! There are literally only a few dings. Comes with a nearly new hardshell case, but the rear hinge has pulled loose. All of the latches work, and the case will protect the guitar. ***** I will use whatever shipping method you prefer, so don't pay the invoice until we've agreed on a shipper. *************", "ItemID": "292902106641", "EndTime": "2019-01-11T02:44:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T02:44:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/DeArmond-M-72-w-Dearmond-USA-Gold-Tone-Pickups-near-Mint-/292902106641", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nashville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929021066418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1Nzg=/z/LGgAAOSwkERcLsRP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDIx/z/yEIAAOSwukZcLsRS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDgw/z/VXgAAOSwVCpcLsRV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxNlgxNjAw/z/n8YAAOSwydZcLsRY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37215", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dorminy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 859, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "DeArmond M-72 w/ Dearmond USA Gold Tone Pickups, near Mint", "HitCount": 128, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
