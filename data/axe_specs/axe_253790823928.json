{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Richie Sambora's 1996 JW Black Masterbuilt 1960's Stratocaster (RS12). Built for and delivered to Richie in May of 1996 along with Richie's Ice Blue Clapton Strat. (RS14). 3TSB with 2 Abby Fat 50's Pickups (Neck & Middle) and an Abby Texas Special in the bridge position. Fully documented with original Fender COA (rare for artist guitars) and by JW Black on the neck heel, neck pocket, under the pickguard and in the tremolo cavity. Guitar is in excellent condition for having been used/played with a few dings and clear coat/pickguard scratches but overall very clean (as with all of Richie's former guitars that I own - they were all very well maintained and taken care of by Richie and his Tech). Guitar appears to be all original when compared to JW Black's Fender Log (pic. included). Neck was professionally reshaped, likely by Richie's Tech, from the larger 1960's profile to be closer to the thinner early 1960's shape. Can be seen in last few pictures provided. Very comfortable and well done. I also owned RS14 (recently sold), the Ice Blue Clapton model that was built at the same time this guitar was built. That guitar, and those built after it for Richie, all have thinner necks so I can only assume that Richie had this one reshaped to be closer to those since the thinner profile was his preference at that time and for years after. 60's style string tree replaced with a 50's style string tree. Possible refret and/or replaced nut, pro job if done and everything looks and plays great. I own several of Richie's Fender guitars and all have similar or other modifications done to them so there is nothing out of the ordinary with this particular guitar when compared to the others. Some have the neck lacquer sanded off or varying degrees of reshaping to the neck, pickup swaps, refrets, etc. They were played and Richie used them as tools of his trade but always took very good care of them. It's amazing how clean some of these guitars are after being out on numerous tours all over the world. Includes case, COA and case candy/items pictured. Please feel free to message me with any questions or if you would like to see additional pictures. Serious inquires & reasonable offers only please. All shipping and shipping insurance costs to be paid by prospective buyer. Continental U.S. $50 flat rate. International, if possible, at actual shipping & insurance costs (TBD) I'm not sure if I will be able to ship to certain places overseas due to new CITES regulations so that will need to be discussed and investigated should an international buyer be interested.", "ItemID": "253790823928", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T15:02:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-08-01T18:18:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Richie-Samboras-Fender-JW-Black-Masterbuilt-1960s-3TSB-Stratocaster-1996-/253790823928", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lutherville-Timonium, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2537908239288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5n4AAOSwr85bYecd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ys8AAOSwNppbYeVq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3McAAOSwn6dbYeVu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7ZwAAOSwvg1bYeVx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PTIAAOSwk3BbYeV7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/7gwAAOSwpG1bYeYy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/qlsAAOSwFqpbYeYy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/jCcAAOSwijhbYeY2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTMzWDgwMA==/z/TUAAAOSwuOpbYeY3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDQ4MA==/z/Ow4AAOSwXahbYebP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O9UAAOSwoAVbYeV9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/J6cAAOSwtbBbYeWA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "21093", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fender070701", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 200, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 5295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 5295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 519}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "Asia"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Richie Sambora's Fender JW Black Masterbuilt 1960's 3TSB Stratocaster (1996)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JW Black Masterbuilt Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["3 Tone Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 2091, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent (Used)", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
