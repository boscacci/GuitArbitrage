{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender American Professional Stratocaster 6-String Electric Guitar - #1058347 SKU: 1058347 Item Condition E+ Excellent Plus - May have slight wear, but only visible under close up inspection. Item Description The Evolution Of A Revolution Often copied, but never surpassed, the Stratocaster is arguably the world's most-loved electric guitar. Electrifying the music world since its debut in 1954, its natural, versatile sound made the Stratocaster the benchmark for exceptional guitar tones. The American Professional Stratocaster isn't a re-imagining of the classic design; it's the authentic original model, evolved. @@ Three Tim Shaw-designed V-Mod single-coil Stratocaster pickups @@ New modern \"Deep C\"-shaped neck profile @@ Bone nut; 22 narrow-tall frets for easier bending @@ Pop-in tremolo arm for enhanced stability @@ Treble bleed circuit maintains highs when reducing volume @@ Includes Elite Molded hardshell case V-Mod Pickups V-Mod Stratocaster pickups are engineered using a proprietary blend of alnico magnet types for the neck and middle pickups. Each pickup is voiced specifically for its position, creating high-output tone with vintage warmth and the crisp, clear sound that made Fender a legend. New \"Deep C\" Neck Profile Designed for comfort and speed, the new American Professional \"Deep C\" neck profile sports more substantial shoulders. The increased mass and altered geometry creates a more natural feel that's perfect for chord and single-note playing alike. Narrow-Tall Frets Narrow-tall frets are taller and narrower than their medium jumbo cousins, making them especially effective for bending notes and playing chords up the neck with perfect intonation. Pop-In Tremolo Arm The new pop-in tremolo arm securely stays in position, no matter how hard you play. The arm tension can also be adjusted for a perfectly dialed-in feel that matches any player's preference. Treble-Bleed Circuit The treble-bleed circuit maintains the high end when turning down the volume knob to reduce gain, letting your tone shine through, no matter where the instrument's volume is set. Bone Nut An original-era Fender design element, a bone nut contributes to superior tone and performance. Many players consider bone nuts to be more \"organic\" sounding.
