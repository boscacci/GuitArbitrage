{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Used but modified Gretsch G1910 Malcom young tribute (NOT SIGNATURE MODEL!) YOU DON\"T SEE THESE OFTEN ! ! ! VERY CLEAN, LIKE NEW, HARDLY PLAYED AT ALL ! ! ! Black padded zippered gig bag can be added for an additional $20, contact me if you purchase this gorgeous Amber guitar and want a gig bag. Some factory blemishes in the finish and body top and binding, but no big deal. Fender style bolt-on neck as pictured. I'm not sure of its weight but it's rather heavy for a compact Gretsch guitar. NOS late '60s pick guard added, as well as black Sperzel Trim-Lok tuners. G string tuner button is different than the rest, I bought them that way, but for $3 you can change it out to a #2. I bought this to add what I had in black, was to add a Bigsby B-700, but never did. Now I am selling it because the compact size of small solid bodies and chambered bodies like this don't fit me, I need full sized hollows. Great Gretsch Tone Switch Circuitry at a MUCH more affordable rate! Madie in 2002 in Korea. The GretschBucker humbucking pickups aren't bad, but can be swapped out if desired, which I planned on doing when I got it, I just decided against keeping it, so in its gig bag it stayed for about ten years. HAHA! Restrung with Gretsch flatwound .010-046 strings for that \"Velvet Touch!' You'll need to adjust it and raise the wrap around bridge because I never did. ASK ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL PHOTOS AND I USUALLY ANSWER SAME DAY OR NEXT. CONTINENTAL US SHIPPING ONLY UNLESS YOU CONTACT ME FIRST, I APPROVE AND QUOTE YOUR SHIPPING CHARGE. WILL BE BOXED IN A GUITAR BOX, WELL PACKED AND PACKAGED.
