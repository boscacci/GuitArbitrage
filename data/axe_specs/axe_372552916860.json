{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Choice Birdseye Maple 2-Piece Squier '51 neck, looks like this one was manufactured in May of 2005 from the mark on the neck heel. This neck is from one of the \"first run\" Squier '51 Vintage Modified Series models. This is one of the nicest necks I have seen from one of the first run models and I have had a few! Real nice chunky C-Profile tele neck, straight as an arrow, has no noticeable fretwear, truss rod responds nicely. What's interesting about this neck is that it is a 2-Piece neck, most of the first run '51's had a solid 1-Piece maple neck. If you look at the last pictures you can see the fretboard is a separate piece of maple, quite rare in fact, I have heard of some of the Squier '51's having these 2-Piece necks but it is the first one I have ever owned! The Birdseye Quilt in the fingerboard is quite beautiful and really stands out, please look at all of the pictures closely. This neck was on a '51 when I got it a few years ago, I used the body for another project and put this neck aside. The previous owner applied a Fender Telecaster Custom decal and what looks like a light coat of poly over the front and back of the headstock. Looks decent but the E in the Fender has a small defect in it at the top part of the letter. Just add tuning machines of your choice and some string trees and this neck will be ready to mount on your '51 or Tele project! The end of the neck heel measures about 2 3/16 inches wide on this one. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
