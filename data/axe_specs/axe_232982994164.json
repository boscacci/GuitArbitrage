{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Thanks for stopping to check out our listing friend! Please know we are here to serve you.

If there is anything specific you're looking for, or anything specific you'd like us to list for you, please don't hesitate to contact us! And please feel free to read a little more about our story below. Item Description:I know absolutely nothing about guitars! But here's a bit of info I found on the ol' interweb: \"The MG74 was made in Korea under strict quality control, and was part of the original Mercury series. Of that series, the MG7xs were the highest ranking of the imports. The MG7xs included the 70, 72, and 74. Basically this is an alder body, maple neck, and flamed maple top. They were replaced by the MG740 of the Mercury II line in 1994...The last retail price was $719.90, so trust me the MG-74 model is no joke and not a beginners guitar.\" Item Condition: Like the title says, this is definitely a barn find. Pretty rough but she just screams that she's lived a life and has seen things most have not. I'm not too entirely sure I would restore this. I might hang it on the wall as is. One hell of a conversation piece! THE ESTATES MEN: My names Chris and I work with my Mom, Gail and my older brother, Kyle. We started selling on eBay shortly after my little brother, Kevin passed in June of 2018. We weren't very close as a family and I wasn't a very good big brother to Kevin. It's unfortunate that it took him passing for me to realize all of this but now that I have, I will not lose another day doing something that doesn't bring me joy or closer to my family. Fortunately, my family loves treasure hunting as much as I do, so we decided to become eBayer's together! Each of us brings a unique and formidable amount of knowledge in numerous areas but we're also very eager to learn as much as we can, in hopes of bringing you all the best treasures on eBay! If we could ask anything of you, it would be to subscribe to our store and to please reach out and let us know what you're looking for. We want to succeed in what we're doing here so any feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading a little bit about us!
