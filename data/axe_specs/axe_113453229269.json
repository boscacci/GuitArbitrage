{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "VERY NICE MADE INJAPAN FENDER SQUIER CONTEMPORARY STRATOCASTER These E-Series Fender Squiers are great guitars andare an excellent value. Built in themid-1980\u2019s at the FujiGen factory in Japan. This one was built around 1986 based on the serial number. They are very good quality. Features include: \u00b7 Red glossy body with black painted headstock \u00b7 No pick guard \u00b7 22 frets neck with medium-thin profile for greatplayability \u00b7 2 Single-coils + 1 Humbucker \u00b7 1 volume pot \u00b7 1 Tone pot \u00b7 Truss rod adjustment at the headstock \u00b7 Neck tilt adjustmentat the neck plate \u00b7 Stamped Fender saddle \u00b7 Fender sealed tuners \u00b7 3 mini toggle-switches for maximum tonal possibilities. Both single coil switches are On-Off. The switch for the humbucker is On-Off-CoilTap (split), so you can have single coil or humbucker sound in the bridge position. You can have any combination of pickups withthis configuration, any one, any two or even all three pickups at once. \u00b7 Has a 24 \u00be\u201d Gibson scale in a strat! I do hate to sell thisguitar because it really is a great player, but I have 22 guitars and I want toget a control surface for recording. Thisguitar needs to go to a good home! I believe it is a completely originalguitar (including the knobs) except for the whammy bar (not pictured, but itwill be included). Action is nice and low. The prior owner had the frets lightly levelled,they are in great shape. The guitar is in very good condition. Has some very minor nicks here and there thatyou have to look hard to see. It has oneding below the bridge that is about \u00bc\u201d by 3/8\u201d long and a rice sized ding nearby. Still you don\u2019t see them until you lookpretty close. I took some pictures to try to show the dings. These triple toggle MIJ Contemporary Strats arerelatively rare. You would be hardpressed to find a nicer one than this without paying big bucks. Comes with a very beat up Fender hard casethat is badly cracked. It is good forshipping and keeping it safe at home, not for normal use. Also comes with two allen wrenches in thecase storage compartment. It\u2019s a well madeguitar that feels good in your hands and plays very well. The red finished body is sound, the neck is smooth andstraight and in great shape, the tuners are quality sealed Fender tuners, and the bridge/tremolois good quality. The neck is medium, not overly thin, but not fat at all. The action is low and very comfortable withno buzz. Shipping is $35 flatfor the lower 48 states and actual shipping to Alaska or Hawaii.
