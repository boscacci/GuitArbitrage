{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "GIBSON LES PAUL VOODOO GUITAR Made in a limited run from 2002-2004, the Les Paul Voodoo features a swamp ash body, ebony fret board, 496R & 500T pickups, and a red voodoo skull inlay. This is a used guitar that has been well cared for. Please note in the photos that there is a hairline crack in the front of the head (see pics). The case is also original and is in very good condition. The lock has never been used and still has the plastic pin in it. There are some scratches on the top front (see pics). I bought this guitar in 2004 and it has been in my possession the entire time. Because of the hairline crack I am willing to part with it at a discount. Shipping is $65.00 Shipping will include insurance to protect both buyer and seller.

Have you had the crack in the headstock assessed by a professional? Thanks.sugobon reply: 1. There is no buckle rash on the guitar. It was never played professionally. I only played it a handful of times. 2. I have not had the guitar inspected by a professional. I noticed the hairline crack for the first time yesterday. dmw858 Hello. Does the crack go through so it\u2019s visible on the back? Was it repaired at all? Do you think it affects intonation? Thanks!sugobon reply:1. The crack does NOT go all the way through to the back. See additional pics of the front and back of the head. 2. I do not know if it affects intonation because I have not played the guitar. 91evo Hello, Has anything been done to the crack to prevent expansion? (Repair, etc) Thankssugobon reply:1.

QUESTIONS FROM BIDDERS: highfilms Hi, is there a photo where the red in the grooves of the body shows any better? I've seen some where the red is really prevalent and others where there isn't much red at all. Just trying to get a good visual of the body. Thanks, Interesting crack. Was it there when you bought it? Almost looks like it's along the glue line for part of the headstock.sugobon reply:1. I am attaching 2 pics showing the grain of the body. 2. There was no crack when I bought the guitar. I first noticed it on the day I listed it on eBay.", "ItemID": "273633799280", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T19:02:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T19:02:45.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/GIBSON-Les-Paul-VOODOO-2003-Ebony-w-Red-Skull-Guitar-/273633799280", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Glendora, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736337992808080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3OTc=/z/B3cAAOSwN5hcKmJj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE3MFgxNjAw/z/EfkAAOSwqoxcKmJr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTMyWDE2MDA=/z/xwYAAOSwAFFcKmJx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mFgAAOSwwTFcKmJ7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0N1gxNjAw/z/CFoAAOSwJFBcKmKp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n2oAAOSw-sVcKmKv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8EUAAOSwMd1cKmK1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTI3WDE2MDA=/z/770AAOSwcapcKmKG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3N1gxNjAw/z/yfUAAOSwF5VcKmKN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzgxWDE2MDA=/z/oXIAAOSwhspcKmKT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4OFgxNjAw/z/330AAOSwlfNcKmKf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ0M1gxNjAw/z/~rAAAOSwjfdcKmK9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91740", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sugobon", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 335, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 653}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "GIBSON Les Paul VOODOO 2003 Ebony w Red Skull Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Swamp Ash", "Ebony"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2003"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Voodoo"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 721, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 720.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
