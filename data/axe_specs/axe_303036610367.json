{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Standard Stratocaster Made In Mexico in great condition. The color is Lake Placid Blue w/ a custom paint job that looks fantastic in person. Brought it with me to Guitar Center for the free lessons and all the associates thought it was one amazing looking guitar. Only selling because my wife won\u2019t let me have too many guitars. Condition: I would rate the condition as excellent overall. There is a very small dent in the side of the body (see picture) and that is really about it. Shows very little wear and plays amazing. I set it up to low action with no fret buzz and near perfect intonation. Mods: I did upgrade it a little bit with new saddles, new 9 gauge NYXL Addario strings (put on 1 month ago with little play), colored volume and tune knobs; put a wood block in the back (kinda like a Clapton mod); new neck plate; will include the vintage saddles it came with in the gig bag. I ship to US only and will ship USPS within 1-2 business days after payment. I strive to ship quickly and make it a smooth transaction. Thank you for looking.", "ItemID": "303036610367", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T16:28:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-21T12:25:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Standard-Stratocaster-Made-Mexico-Great-Cond-Custom-Paint-w-Bag-/303036610367", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Indialantic, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030366103678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QW8AAOSwWH1cQ9Zs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WnAAAOSwEGBcRUOt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0pYAAOSws~pcQ9Zw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TRAAAOSwEKxcQ9Zx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qnAAAOSwC~9cQ9Z2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wYoAAOSwOShcQ9Zy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/htwAAOSwgrZcQ9Z0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hp8AAOSwRbpcQ9Z4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7jQAAOSwW69cQ9Z8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6mcAAOSw6IdcQ9Z1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JT8AAOSwhY9cRUPr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32903", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kevins2990", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 256, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5066}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Standard Stratocaster Made In Mexico in Great Cond; Custom Paint; w/ Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 36, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
