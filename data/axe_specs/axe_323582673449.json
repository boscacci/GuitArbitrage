{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a lake placid blue Fender Duo Sonic. Guitar was purchased a few months ago and is in excellent condition. Plays great. I am only selling because I am moving and having to downsize my guitar collection. Guitar has coil taps which provide an ample amount of tonal options. Has a single coil neck pickup and humbucker in the bridge which gives this guitar a lot of versatility. The finish is gorgeous and was only available through a select few retailers. Shipping is $35 for lower 48. Stand not included. Thanks for looking and have a great day!", "ItemID": "323582673449", "EndTime": "2018-12-09T17:50:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-04T17:50:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Duo-Sonic-HS-Lake-Placid-Blue-Special-Edition-Electric-Guitar-/323582673449", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bowling Green, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235826734498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XLMAAOSw29JcBrw~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OjIAAOSws99cBrxN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "42103", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mlvera28", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 868, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.6}, "BidCount": 14, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 282.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 282.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 73}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Duo Sonic HS Lake Placid Blue\u00a0Special Edition Electric Guitar ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Duo Sonic HS"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 411, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 287.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
