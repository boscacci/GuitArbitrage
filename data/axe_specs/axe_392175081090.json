EMG Active Pickups. High Performance Tele! From The Web: Heavy mahogany for a heavy modern rock icon. The Jim Root electric guitar is a truly modern Fender Tele built for big sounds! As lead guitarist for Slipknot and Stone Sour, Jim Root is one of today's leading heavy guitarists. This Telecaster guitar from the Artist Series was a labor of love for both Jim and Fender, combining several unique features to give it an identity all its own. A Telecaster for the new millennium, the Jim Root Tele features a warmly resonant mahogany body with active EMG\u00ae pickups for high headroom, thick distortion, and pristine clean sounds. The black hardware, and flat finish offer a unique and heavy aesthetic. If you're looking for a Tele that \"goes to 11,\" the Jim Root Artist Series is your guitar. Includes case.This is a true \"Closet Queen\" This Jim Root Telecaster was purchased by a collector who has all the Fender Artist Series guitar in his personal collection. Unknowingly, his wife purchased this guitar 3 months before his birthday not knowing that he already had this model. He traded it in on a Brad Paisley Tele in my shop. The guitar looks new, smells new and has the case, case candy; everything you would get when you purchase it new. The only flaw are some light strumming scratches on the pickguard.
