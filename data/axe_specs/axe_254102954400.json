{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Based on the S-200 T-Bird reissue, the T-Bird ST features the same unique, asymmetrical shape, but with a simplified feature set. Minimalist players will appreciate the added stability and reliability of a stop tailpiece and pared down electronic controls, while enjoying the T-Bird\u2019s retro vibe. The dual Guild Franz P90 pickups found on the T-Bird ST P90 are perfect for the player looking for that crisp, vintage, single-coil sound, offering plenty of mid-range output that can be driven to a soaring classic rock tone. The T-Bird features a vintage C shape set mahogany neck, and bound rosewood fingerboard with mother-of-pearl block inlays. Other period-correct details include open gear vintage tuning machines, and famed asymmetrical headstock adorned with Guild\u2019s logo and Thunderbird icon in mother-of-pearl.
