{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For a demo see clip at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkhq6l5sLBg> November Rain solo on this Travel Guitar. From the Traveler Guitar website: NEW COST $399.99 The Pro-Series represents Traveler Guitar\u2019s original production model and remains a standard of innovation and design for travel guitars. The proprietary In-Body Tuning System uses standard tuning machines relocated into the body, eliminating the need for a headstock. As a result, you\u2019ll have the same full-scale playing experience you\u2019re used to on an instrument that\u2019s 28% shorter and 64% lighter than a typical full size electric. If you have ever wanted to have both an acoustic and electric guitar in one, the Pro-Series is for you. It features a custom piezo pickup (like standard acoustic/acoustic electric guitars) and a single-coil electric pickup, so you can play a breadth of tones and styles with just one instrument. The 24 \u00be-inch scale neck-through body sounds great through acoustic and electric amplifiers, or through its unique internal resonant pickup system with the included stethophone headset, which allows for private listening without batteries or an amp. The lap rest is detachable for easy transport, so guitar and included gig bag fit easily in an airline overhead compartment.One-piece maple neck-through-body with Natural satin finishHybrid Acoustic and Electric with piezo and electric pickupsDetachable lap rest for transportation and storageIncludes deluxe gig bag, limited lifetime warrantyFull 24 3/4\" scale steel-string acoustic/electric travel guitar that fits in airline overhead bins NOTE: Shipping costs - There is some confusion on the site as I listed on ebay.com while registered on ebay.nl Flat rate to North America, Australia and New Zealand - US$40 Flat Rate to UK and EU - US$23", "ItemID": "401707250524", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T19:20:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-13T19:20:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Traveler-Guitar-Pro-Series-Maple-/401707250524", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Utrecht", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/4017072505248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/HsEAAOSwSxVcVe8c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/YY8AAOSwWrxcVe8r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/iL4AAOSwR3tcVe89/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/XYwAAOSw7HhcVe9O/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/8wgAAOSwNTNcVe9i/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/HEUAAOSwPatcVe-Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ZA0AAOSwckZcVe-g/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/gx0AAOSwwkRcVe-p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "3533JC", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "terranchudma-0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 110.52, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 110.52, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***3", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 14}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "Europe", "CA", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": " Traveler Guitar Pro Series (Maple)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Traveler Guitar"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Headless"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural maple"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Pro Series"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 404, "Subtitle": "Travel guitar lightweight full scale hybrid elec/acoust", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "NL", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 113.02, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "RU", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The original Traveler Guitar Pro Series Maple.
