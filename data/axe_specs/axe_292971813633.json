It's in the exact same condition I received it in, except I cleaned the guitar and put on some new strings. Everything works as it should. There are a couple of nicks in the paint which do not affect it's playability, more of a cosmetic issue. Great sounding guitar, I just need to thin out my collection over the next couple of months. Ask any questions before bidding, please. Shipping to CONUS ONLY. Guitar will be relisted if reserve is not met. ...Cat not included.
