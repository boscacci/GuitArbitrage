{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Pretty much unused in its 50 - plus years. Passed on to me from a buddy who owed me, he bought it 1967. There are a good few hairline cracks in clear coat, from storage in the cold, and minimal, superficial nicks. The case is in excellent condition and actually has the original,working key. Some original paperwork and tag. Quite nearly in mint condition. The pad on back is as new. A definite British 60's relic, made in Italy, in great shape. Don't want to deal with the hassle of return, so unless it is damaged in transit, am selling for reasonable price, and that's that. It is a strange, unique guitar, works fine. Has an mechanical string mute, which works but not very useful, but of quirky interest. All in all, it is pretty neat, I have not seen one for sale anywhere in this state of condition. Of course, now that I am listing this, I start to feel like keeping the darned thing...while I thought I would never say it - I have too many guitars.", "ItemID": "283310449028", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T01:13:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-20T02:32:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1960s-Vox-Mark-IX-Teardrop-9-String-Electric-Guitar-V-231-Circa-1966-/283310449028", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Montvale, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833104490288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UI8AAOSwZKlcGvmf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hKgAAOSwT5tcGvmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mPEAAOSwAopcGvmf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/l98AAOSw6iZcGvmb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VMcAAOSwGVFcGvmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MjsAAOSwQXlcGvmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7t4AAOSwniVcGvmf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q-kAAOSwVAtcGvmY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vxkAAOSwL-xcGvmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FfkAAOSwu4dcGvmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oIIAAOSwC9hcGvmd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fSEAAOSwFAtcGvmf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07645", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "davisema-2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 62, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2409}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1960's Vox Mark IX Teardrop 9 String Electric Guitar V-231 Circa 1966 ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Vox"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["9 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}]}, "HitCount": 129, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
