The guitar has light playwear and is in excellent condition. It is all original with no changed out parts. There's some light scratches on the end near the rear strap button - but not thru the finish. There's a small paint chip on the body at the neck plate - very clean other than that. The frets don't have any playwear and there are very few pickmarks, so it looks like it was barely played. Here's the spec's -- As the distinctive early-\u201960s offspring of the equally distinctive Jazzmaster\u00ae guitar, the Jaguar guitar became an enduring favorite that has successfully spanned many decades and genres, be it \u201960s surf, \u201970s punk, \u201980s new wave, \u201990s grunge and beyond ...This Fender design classic paired brighter pickups with a shorter (24\u201d) scale length. The trio of sliding pickup selector switches, rotary volume wheels on the upper bout, and chrome hardware and tremolo lock are all signature Jaguar traits, and the removable Fender Mute is a built-in string-damping device created with surf bands in mind.FeaturesModel Name: American Vintage \u201862 Jaguar\u00ae Model Number: 010-0900-(Color#) Series: American Vintage Series Colors: Ocean Turquoise (Nitrocellulose Lacquer Finish) Body: Alder Neck: Maple, \u201cC\u201d Shape, (Nitrocellulose Lacquer Finish) Fingerboard: Rosewood, 7.25\u201d Radius (184mm) No. of Frets: 22 Vintage Style Frets Pickups: 2 Special Design American Vintage Jaguar Single-Coil Pickups (Neck & Bridge) Controls: \u201cLead\u201d Circuit: 2-Position Tone Switch, Volume, Tone,\u201cRhythm\u201d Circuit: Volume, Tone, Circuit Selector Switch Pickup Switching: 2-On/Off Slide Switches, One for Each Pickup Bridge: Vintage Style \u201cFloating\u201d Tremolo with Tremolo Lock Button Machine Heads: Fender/Gotoh\u00ae Vintage Style Tuning Machines Hardware: Chrome Scale Length: 24\u201d (610 mm) Width at Nut: 1.650\u201d (41 mm) She comes with the original Fender hardshell case as seen in the pictures- no trem arm.
