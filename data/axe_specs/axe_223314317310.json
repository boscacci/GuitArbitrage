{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson ES-137 made in 12/2012 so it might be a 2013 model. Wide flames on the top which move around at different angles and are hard to photo. The bridge pickup is original but the neck pickup has been replaced with a pretty interesting (and expensive) Echopark Gold Coil that was put in there before I took this in on a trade. I don't have the original pickup. The fretboard is nice and dark on this one (none of that light washed out garbage) and the neck profile is perfect...not too thin and not baseball ball chunky. Original Gibson Custom hard case is included and it is in great shape. Gibson COA is also included Condition: I'll call it Extremely Good. Very mild fret wear on the first couple and some mild weather checking on the neck binding. Minor surface wear here and there and a small surface mark between the pickups. No significant gouges or deep scratches. Some set-up tweaks to your personal taste will likely be in order. USPS to Continental USA only. Please read my feedback and buy with confidence. I have sold many expensive guitars on Ebay.", "ItemID": "223314317310", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T19:27:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T19:47:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-ES-137-/223314317310", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Denver, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233143173108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jjsAAOSwiwZcFmzy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LsgAAOSw3bZcFmz1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LesAAOSwCNlcFmz4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IVkAAOSw~llcFmz7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SP0AAOSwn6JcFmz~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BnMAAOSwO7dcFm0C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lrwAAOSw4VpcFm0G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k3YAAOSwALpcFm0J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r5QAAOSwusdcFm0N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uj4AAOSw7OdcFm0S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "80209", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thunderlung", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 126, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 9}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson ES-137", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-137"]}]}, "HitCount": 75, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
