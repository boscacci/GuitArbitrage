{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gibson Flying V 2004 This was purchased a number of years ago for an advertising requirement and we used it to demo a guitar amp we were building. It is in very nice shape. There is some bucks rash on the back as you would expect but nothing through the finish. There is a small nick in the back of the neck but you don\u2019t notice it when you are playing it. I thought this was a 67 Reissue but the serial number daters just come upas a regular V. The case is in great working shape. All of the clips and the lock are in working order. The guitar cover is in great shape and I will he including the truss rod tool. Slight ding at the top on the outside but for a 15 year old guitar.. I took it to the NAMM show in 2007 and someone wanted to take a picture of Rudolph Schenker and he only takes pics with flying V\u2019s so he asked to borrow it for the picture. That being said this kid very lightweight and has the smaller V profile like a 67. It plays great and if you are looking for a V, this one is awesome.", "ItemID": "192834635754", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T01:45:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-22T01:45:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Flying-V-67-Reissue-/192834635754", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Glen Ellyn, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1928346357548080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k~QAAOSwbjNcb0~o/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LwYAAOSwbURcb0~w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xO0AAOSwnDRcb0~9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TuYAAOSw0bpcb0~S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1FYAAOSwxbFcb0~V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ebAAAOSwbh9cb0~T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjEyWDUzOQ==/z/KYQAAOSwpCFcb0~K/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60137", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thomaskperkins", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 333, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 19, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 739.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 739.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 674}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Flying V \u201867 Reissue", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Flying V"]}]}, "HitCount": 703, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 749.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
