{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Japan Telecaster TL62B-650 A-Serial Black !! Description This is Fender Japan Telecaster TL62B-650 A-Serial Black. I was only practicing at home, I have not used it outdoors or live etc. There are no big scratches on the body, but there are several minor scratches. The fret seems not to be so worn out. Also, because it is not detailed to the guitar maintenance, adjustment of the neck etc is not done. Because it is a guitar about 25 years ago, please think that the neck is necessary adjustment. I changed the string to a new one. It is Regular Slinky of Ernie Ball. At that time the warranty, genuine soft case is attached. Body basswood with binding neck maple oval type 324 scale fretbord rosewood 184R 21F guitar weight 3500g PLEASE CHECK MY OTHER GUITARS.
