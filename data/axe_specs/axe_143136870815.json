{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a beautiful guitar that sounds and plays great. It was built at the Saein plant in Korea, which has a reputation for excellent quality guitars. I replaced the stock pickups and electronics with a GFS \u201cClassic 59\u201d AlNiCo V humbucker at the bridge, a GFS AlNiCo Mean 90 P90 at the neck and Gibson full size potentiometers. Sounds killer.The Guitar has a \u201c2ND\u201d stamped at the back of the neck (serial number covered on purpose), which means it had some cosmetic flaw when inspected at the factory. Honestly I have no idea where the issue is. Either way this is a used guitar in very good condition, really minor signs of use, well taken care of.Neck is straight. Frets are good. The original bone nut has a little missing piece near the edge on the low E string side, but the string is well seated it\u2019s never been a problem, even on low tunings.Nice hard case in good condition is included (no key).PLEASE NO INTERNATIONAL BIDS. NO EXCEPTIONS. Sold As Is, no returns. Check my feedback and bid with confidence.
