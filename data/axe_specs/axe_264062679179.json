The Warlock has been long been synonymous with playing hard and rocking out, always bold to the core. This Warlock Core gives the classic Warlock body shape a new dimension. Visually, you will immediately be drawn to the bold carbon-fiber-inspired strip inlayed onto the top of the Bullet Broof Black finish. This upgraded Warlock has a long-set Mah neck with slim heel, Mah body, and Rosewood fretboard adorned with the distinctive BC Rich \"R\" logo as the lone inlay element. The cutaway is nice and deep giving you full access to all 24 frets for shredding solos, and this neck is incredibly fast. The electronics are smoking - featuring BCR Extra-Hot Humbuckers that are bolted directly to the body for soaring tones. It is really a comfortable neck, and the tones are fantastic.
