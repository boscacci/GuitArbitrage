{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1990 Korean made Westone Villain Graphite. Has the ORIGINAL modulus graphite neck with the 22 fret ebonal fretboard. 2 single EMG Select single coils, and an EMG Select humbucker in the bridge, complete with coil tap. Also has a Kahler Spyder trem bridge. Now the \"project\" part of the description. It needs the locking nuts and screws, an arm, the low E string fine tuner, (yes, there is a screw there that works perfectly in a pinch.) a strap pin on the bottom, and the Kahler needs to be set up. (If you play with Kahlers, you have all of those parts in a drawer somewhere. Or you can purchase them on eBay here.) As you see in the pics, the neck is great, with a tiny mark on the back of it, that won't show in the pics and you can't feel when you play, and the body has a few scraps, bumps and bruises. (I have no clue how that one grouping of marks happened. like some idiot dropped a screw driver on it many times.) And has the normal bumps and scrapes you would expect from a 28 year old shredder guitar. Has a non original Gigbag. Please pay within 24 hours of winning bid.If you are within 100 miles of the Jacksonville area, I will gladly meet you halfway.", "ItemID": "323651335737", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T02:32:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T02:32:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1990-WESTONE-VILLAIN-w-MODULUS-graphite-neck-RARE-Project-/323651335737", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Jacksonville, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236513357378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4xkAAOSwvEhcPpct/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HE4AAOSwwDJcPpcv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/A7kAAOSwNJJcPpct/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GHcAAOSw5wNcPpct/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/k-gAAOSw2fRcPpct/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VJUAAOSwvrJcPpcs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DiwAAOSwkjJcPpct/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M5IAAOSwnh5cPpcu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AP4AAOSwP85cPpcu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/goQAAOSw0VxcPpcu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32254", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cindylikescandy", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 307, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 172.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 172.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***x", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 4}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1990 WESTONE VILLAIN w/ MODULUS graphite neck!
