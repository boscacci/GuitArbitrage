{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Schecter omen diamond series 7 string with active electronics in great condition. There is a three way pickup selector switch, volume knob, and a tone knob. It has the Duncan designed pick ups and a big through body bridge. The guitar has mostly been used in a studio, and has not seen much travel or wear. It\u2019s great for metal genres of course, and instrumental music, but can also be coaxed into sounding like a telecaster for some low country notes. It\u2019s very cold here right now, so the guitar will be shipped without the 9 V battery that is part of the circuitry so it doesn\u2019t potentially freeze and crack and damage the guitar. There is also a soft sided gig bag that comes with it. I had this before I Purchased the guitar and it is not made for it, but it fits well.", "ItemID": "323702935762", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T17:44:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T17:44:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Schecter-Omen-Active-Diamond-Series-7-String-Gig-Bag-/323702935762", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3237029357628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NDQ=/z/SmMAAOSwESdcbYva/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NDY=/z/JbMAAOSwddpcbYvc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IIIAAOSwb-JcbYv5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Pf0AAOSwZGJcbYv7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6J0AAOSw4sxcbYwA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Pf8AAOSwZGJcbYv9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dPYAAOSwxphcbYv-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60657", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "us_charg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 15, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Schecter Omen Active Diamond Series 7 String With Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Schecter"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 29, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
