The new G6131T-62 Vintage Select 62 Jet Firebird with Bigsby rocks that legacy to perfection.The early 1960s saw the double-cut Jet get a black back, a zero-fret and gold hardware. As previously, its signature power and punch came from chambered mahogany construction, which magnifies harmonic richness by letting air resonate between the top and body for livelier and more articulate tone. Thats all here on this fiery tone machine, along with TV Jones Classic pickups that replicate that vintage FilterTron sound to fabulous sonic effect.
