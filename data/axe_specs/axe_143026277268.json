{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a gorgeous Tom Anderson Pro-Am with all original pickups from 2012. Specifics are listed below. Guitar has been well taken care of as it's been one of the number 1 instruments I've used on the road the last 5 years. Never a problem, never an issue. Some standard gig wear as one might suspect, a few dings here and there that I tried to make out with the photos. A finish crack along the back of the neck a couple years ago prompted me to send the guitar directly to Tom Anderson and let him look at it personally. He assured me it was a simple finish crack and all was good! Having no pickguard in order to show the beauty of the grain, the guitar also has some light pick hazing, as one might surmise from a working instrument like this one. No functional issues, this guitar is solid as a rock! Beautiful red to black fade finish over ash body. Great playing maple neck with stainless frets. This guitar has NEVER given me a moment's issue. Why sell? I have several Andersons and must pay some critical bills at this time, so my loss is your gain..... Story of a gigging musician's life..... Priced to sell, and comes with original hard case with trem arm, fretboard guard, and all the case candy I could find for it, all in excellent condition. This guitar plays GREAT and the buyer will not be disappointed. Gonna be a great working guitar for someone for sure! Paypal ONLY! NO INTERNATIONAL BIDDING; I'll cancel all bids outside the US. You pay the shipping and I'll pay the insurance to get her to ya. Shipping via UPS insured. Please give this one a serious look and a good home. Feel free to contact me with any questions; I have excellent feedback and want all buyers to be totally satisfied! Have fun bidding and thanks for looking. God bless.
