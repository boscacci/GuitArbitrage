More on the RS502T from Yamaha...........Stripped down, rev'd up and ready to rock. Japanese minimalist style is simple to describe but hard to capture. With just enough of everything you need, and nothing that you don\u2019t, the RS502T is exactly what it should be\u2013beautifully simple. Includes gig bag. PickupsDesigned from the ground up, Revstar features specially wound YGD pickups that are perfectly matched to each guitar. More than 50 prototype pickups were tested featuring different combinations of wire, windings, magnets and base plates. Eventually, a spec was settled on for each guitar model and the Revstar pickup series was born. This model features VP5 pickups (8.3k DCR) with Alnico V magnets, German silver baseplate and plain enamel wire for clear, vintage tone with bite. Dry SwitchDesigned especially for Revstar, Yamaha's proprietary Dry Switch gives you the versatility of a coil split, but with a tone that's miles ahead. Using a passive filter circuit painstakingly designed to give the perfect frequency response, the Dry Switch filters out low frequencies to give the punch and clarity of a single coil pickup minus the inevitable hum and hollow tone often associated with split humbucking pickups. And because it's a filter circuit, the Dry Switch works on both humbuckers and P90s for a totally unique, usable tone. Custom HardwareInspired by the stripped-down custom Caf\u00e9 Racer motorbikes popularized on the streets of London in the 1960s, Revstar's hardware captures the high-performance, individual character of those bikes with a wide range of totally unique, customized hardware. From the unique pickup covers and raw copper scratchplate on the Revstar Professional, to the totally custom floating aluminum tailpiece on the RS502T, each and every component is perfectly calibrated for great performance and unmistakable style\u2014capturing the very essence of a Caf\u00e9 Racer. Sound ImageInspired by raw power and performance, Revstar's sound is as unique and bold as its aesthetic. Working to evoke a visceral, unbridled power and an individual, organic tone that is made possible only by considering every detail, Yamaha's engineers chose materials carefully and designed custom pickups to make sure Revstar sounds as stunning as it looks.
