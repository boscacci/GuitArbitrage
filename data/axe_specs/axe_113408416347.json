{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2013 Gibson Grace Potter Signature Flying V Nocturnal Brown w/ Case & Paperwork I purchased this guitar in 2014 from the original owner. It had a pro set up put on it with new strings, I played it once and it has sat in a case ever since. There is absolutely ZERO buckle rash on the back side, some extremely light marks on the pick guard and a couple of imperfections that are shown in the pictures. Comes with original Gibson paperwork and purchased/warranty registration. This guitar is in extremely nice, rarely played condition. Please see photos for item condition. Check your application before bidding. Questions? I am happy to answer any of your questions about this item. Thanks, Dean. Corvette Specialties of Oregon.
