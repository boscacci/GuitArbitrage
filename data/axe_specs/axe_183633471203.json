{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you see that this listing changes items it means I sold it elsewhere. A lot of guitars are moving locally this week, so if you\u2019re interested speak up ASAP before it is gone. This is a 2008 Reissue of the original lucite Dan Armstrong guitar. It is made in the Fujigen plant in Japan. comes with a single coil and humbucker pickup as well as a non original gig bag. overall it is in great to excellent condition. A few minor scratches which could buff out and little dings on the headstock. no fret wear to speak of. Please ask all questions before purchasing. I don\u2019t ship to all countries. It depends how reliable the postal service is in a given country. Insurance is also obligatory. Please request a shipping quote prior to purchasing. The EBay shipping quotes aren\u2019t great because the app is very limited with choices.", "ItemID": "183633471203", "EndTime": "2019-01-27T21:20:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T17:53:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2008-Ampeg-Dan-Armstrong-ADA6-Reissue-Lucite-Electric-Guitar-2-Pickups-Bag-/183633471203", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Gatineau, QC", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836334712038080_4.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-OUAAOSwwgBcSdgd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YVMAAOSwcttcSdgo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/25QAAOSwUpFcSdge/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MZAAAOSwQGFcSdgj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hB8AAOSwSONcSdgb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Q6YAAOSwUMBcSdgi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ArgAAOSwsrlcSdgg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3gUAAOSw5xhcSdgm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eicAAOSwnGVcSdgl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "J9J 2R4", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cskguitars83", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 379, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1659.25, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2200.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 152}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "Europe", "US", "AU", "JP"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2008 Ampeg Dan Armstrong ADA6 Reissue Lucite Electric Guitar With 2 Pickups, Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Acrylic", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ampeg"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2008"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Dan Armstrong ADA6"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 239, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
