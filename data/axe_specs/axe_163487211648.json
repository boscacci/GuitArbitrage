One of the most crucial elements to shredding is construction.\u00a0 To that end, Schecter has crafted this C-1 with a double-cut contoured mahogany body, carved quilted maple top, ultra-thin 3-piece mahogany neck and rosewood fretboard.\u00a0 The C-1's neck joint is customized for easy\u00a0high-fret access, and the rosewood fretboard is cut to a flat 14\" radius and topped with 24 extra-jumbo stainless steel frets.\u00a0 Additionally, the C-1 comes equipped with premium hardware, including Grover tuning machines, GraphTech XL Black Tusq nut and TonePros T3BT bridge that strings through the body. The C-1 is loaded with a set of EMG 81TW and 89R\u00a0pickups, perfect for metal and shredding.\u00a0 EMG's design of the 81TW bridge pickup takes coil tapping to the next level, adding a separate single coil pickup in the same housing.\u00a0 This provides the traditional EMG 81 tone, plus an extra single coil pickup, accessed via a push/pull pot.\u00a0 The 81TW also features an internal preamp, delivering two distinct sounds and EMG's noise-cancelling technology. Much like the 81TW, the 89R sports two pickups in one housing.\u00a0 The 89R's coils are reversed, so that the single coil sits closer to the neck, capturing bright, airy, Strat-style tones.\u00a0 On the humbucker side, the 89R utilizes an Alnico V magnet, dishing out warmth, richness and lots of power.\u00a0 Best of all, the 89R has separate preamps and coils, allowing for custom humbucker and single coil sounds. This C-1 is in very good condition, with some faint scratches on the top of the body.\u00a0 It's been professionally setup, and is ready to rock.\u00a0 Does not include case.Year of Manufacture: 2008Country Of Origin: South KoreaColor: Black CherryBound Neck: N/AHardware Color: Black ChromeCase: N/AModifications: N/ADocumentation: N/AElectronics (Controls): Volume (Push-Pull)/Volume (Push-Pull)/Tone/3-Way SwitchNeck Wood: 3-Piece MahoganyNeck Type: Set NeckFretboard Wood: RosewoodPickup Configuration: EMG 89R/EMG81TWInlay Style: Abalone Gothic CrossesTail Type: TonePros T3BT TOM w/ String Thru BodyWeight: 8.81lbsTop Wood: Quilted MapleBody Wood: MahoganyIF YOU BUY IT AND YOU ARE NOT HAPPY WE HAVE THE 30 DAY MONEY BACK RETURN POLICY READ BELOW - THANK YOU SOLD AS USED AND AS IS ,BUT YOU DO HAVE 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF DELIVERY TO CONTACT US FOR A REFUND IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY : Buyer is responsible for shipping charges back to us.
