{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Japanese made Ibanez RG470. It has a LO-TRS tremolo, and the original Ibanez pickups. The frets are in good shape with lots of life left. This is a good playing, good sounding guitar - the action is pretty low. There are no electrical problems, everything works as it should. Now for the bad - this guitar has been banged up over the years, and there are many scrapes, scratches and missing bits of finish - I have tried to show the worst in the photos. There are pick scratches on the front of the guitar, and some scratches on the fretboard around the first fret. There is a small crack in the neck on the back where the Floyd nut screws come through. I have tried to show as many of these flaws as possible in the photos.The tremolo arm is missing, and one of the clamping blocks on the nut is not original (it is bright chrome). I am not sure the strap buttons are original either, and for sure one of the screw on one is not. No bad or case is included, you just get the guitar. I only want to ship to the lower 48 states in the U.S.A.
