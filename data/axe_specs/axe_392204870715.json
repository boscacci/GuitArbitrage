{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding Here is a 2002 Gibson Memphis ES-135. Sounds crystal clear with Gibson Classic 57 Humbuckers. NATURAL/Blonde in beautiful condition and plays easily and solid chording and fretting. Excellent condition. Lovingly maintained, no smoke in home, maintained and only played in recording studio environment. When not being played, in case. Pickguard has normal marks and body is shiny and Nitro Cellulose Laquer is excellent and shiny! Frets polished, top w Gibson finish cream, rosewood fretboard beautiful and maintained yearly w Gibson fretboard oil. A pleasure to own. I bought this from the original owner who supplied the above information and it is spot on--the classic 57s are beautiful in this guitar for jazz or blues or rock----it especially excels at jazz but can compete in any genre with the right peripherals. The guitar sat unplayed for quite a while before i bought it and i am moving in on after a short time to pay some holiday expenses--i usually sell the guitars i haven't had time to really bond with when there's a cash crunch so that's why this one is being offered. I'd keep it if I could. Because it sat so long there's was some scratchiness at the top of the volume pot but my luthier addressed this with graphite and since i got it back i've been twirling the pot and it is much better and will disappear with more use. Essentially an almost mint demo quality guitar in the coveted natural finish (no blemishes on the wood makes this the Gibson choice for the blonde/natural finish) the case is clean and all the latches work although the lock doesn't--the truss rod wrench is included.I will sell overseas but contact me for a shipping quote--from my zip to Spain just cost $170 (i'm as far north and west as you can get in the mainland US)thanks for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392204870715", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T20:35:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T20:35:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Mint-2002-Gibson-ES-135-coveted-blonde-finish-w-OHSC-/392204870715", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Port Townsend, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3922048707158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE2WDE2MDA=/z/8NAAAOSwuQhcKnrC/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4MVgxNjAw/z/9AUAAOSwq6VcKnrN/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MzA=/z/xcwAAOSwkjJcKnrT/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODY=/z/ldUAAOSwBkNcKnrc/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTE3/z/JBYAAOSwGq5cKnrj/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjc2/z/FqwAAOSwjfdcKnrp/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM2NFgxNjAw/z/-bkAAOSw651cKnrw/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTA=/z/Dh8AAOSwhY9cKnr1/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~K0AAOSwLr1cKnr7/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDgy/z/8pEAAOSwhrpcKnsE/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "98368", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "glemons3p26", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3694, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 24, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1024.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1024.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 793}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Mint 2002 Gibson ES-135 coveted blonde finish w OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["natural/blonde"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["67 SG reissue"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2002"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood", "Laminate"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 328, "Subtitle": "offers considered", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1049.66, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM", "RU", "AL", "AD", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "EE", "FI", "GG", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LT", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "SJ", "UA", "VA", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "if an offer is accepted i will re-list the guitar for the offer amount and the buyer will have a few hours to make payment unless someone else sees it and buys it at the offered amount", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
