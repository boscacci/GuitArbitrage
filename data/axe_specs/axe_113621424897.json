Currently it is difficult to obtain because of production end.Go up to one of the guitars that contributed to Japan's hard rock / heavy metal scene Ibanez RG series. Its sharp design not only looks good but also playability, The slim finished neck and the carefully processed fret side are highly evaluated, and the original bridge unit combines the expressiveness and durability and trust from musicians.This model does not use the maple's thrust plate which is common to J \u00b7 Custom etc. I am daringly making it a Solid Ash Specification.
