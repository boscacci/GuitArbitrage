{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Relic Strat- Road Worn Custom Guitar.. Condition is Used. Up for Sale Is the real deal guitar if you are looking for a guitar that plays, sounds & looks great. I customize & put guitar's together from different quality parts & they are way more bang for the buck than guitars at this price. The Guitar is setup properly and stays in tune and plays with ease.The guitar has a genuine 50's road worn body & hardware. The paint has been stripped and the body finished with danish oil and relicd' in the right spots for a great natural look. The neck is an early 90's Squier Neck with a Seventies headstock & a very professional 1970 Fender Strat Decal installed by Mr G'scustom Relics- ( He sells on ebay - check out his necks ) with the Seventies F Logo Tuners & F Logo back plate. The pick up's are what make it. I tried a few different pickups on this guitar & the Fender Saranium Cobolt Noiseless sound unreal. They have the real fender strat sound with NO 60 cycle hum.You wont need to modify it like if you bought a fender roadworn with the BUZZY Tex Mex Pickups. This baby is gig ready. I wish I could keep it but I really need the Money- My loss is your gain. Again .. this guitar is an unreal deal for the $'s you will agree upon receiving :)", "ItemID": "273703599781", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T15:17:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T16:28:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Relic-Strat-Road-Worn-Custom-Guitar-/273703599781", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2737035997818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNFg3NTA=/z/KLcAAOSw57ZcZudz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/964AAOSwaRBcZud8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ud0AAOSwrhNcZueG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1~oAAOSwyXtcZueK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNFg3NTA=/z/4SwAAOSwHOlcZueN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNFg3NTA=/z/Yz0AAOSwXIFcZueS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNFg3NTA=/z/2w4AAOSwufFcZueW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNFg3NTA=/z/Rb0AAOSwotZcZuea/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/16gAAOSwoW1cZueq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "70121", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "galaxyl88", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 249, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 780.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 780.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 98}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Relic Strat-\u00a0Road Worn Custom Guitar.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}]}, "HitCount": 42, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
