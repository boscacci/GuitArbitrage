{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a 1997 Made in USA Fender Lonestar Stratocaster. This guitar is in beautiful condition and has been up graded with Fender locking tuners. The original tuners are included in the case. The color is a beautiful Shoreline Gold. There are no dings or bumps on the body. It looks like this guitar was hardly ever played. The only blemish is a small ding on the top of the headstock. The ding can be seen in the last picture. The frets show no wear at all. The rosewood fretboard is also in perfect condition. It has two Fender single coil pickups and a Seymour Duncan humbucker pickup in the bridge position. This pickup combination gives you all the tonal options you will ever need. The guitar comes with the OHSC and still has the plastic over the Fender name plate. If it wasn't for the very small blemish on the headstock this guitar would be dead mint. Included are the original hang tags, strap, catalogs, and trem arm. The case is in the same condition as the guitar. No rips or tares in the tolex. I don't know when you will see another 1997 Strat in this condition. The Shoreline Gold makes this an absolutely beautiful guitar. Please look at the pictures and if you have any questions please get in touch with us. Shipping will be a flat $59.99 and this will include insurance.", "ItemID": "323672350341", "EndTime": "2019-02-22T21:41:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T03:04:21.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Made-USA-Fender-Lonestar-Stratocaster-OHSC-and-original-paperwork-CLEAN-/323672350341", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lafayette, Louisiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236723503418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X0gAAOSwAOdbLEKZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lqEAAOSwSixbLEKs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2r4AAOSwL~hbLEK6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GuEAAOSwXoJbLELJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IvYAAOSwoKFbLELZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SV8AAOSwlglbLELm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xoUAAOSwZKRbLELt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/U~sAAOSwZrdbLEL4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XUYAAOSw6AlbLEMd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/25gAAOSwL~hbLEMn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/L0YAAOSwORtbLENK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tUQAAOSwq4VbLENP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "70506", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "arfcollector", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3588, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1099.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1099.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 71}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Made in USA Fender Lonestar Stratocaster OHSC and original paperwork CLEAN ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Shoreline Gold"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 184, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "RU"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
