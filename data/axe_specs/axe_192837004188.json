{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2010 Fender American Special Telecaster Made In USA. Outfitted with Tex Mex Pickups. Plays good sounds good. Low action, no string buzz. I've discounted the price because of non original pickups and a few imperfections, none of which effects the playing or sound. Good frets-no significant divots-string impressions just starting on first couple of frets. Paint chipped area on top under your arm, but out of sight by others when you are playing, typical wear scratches. Small finish crack on the bottom side of neck pocket which is common on some teles. It does not show thru in the neck pocket. A couple small pecks on the top of the neck by the nut. A couple small routings showing thru by the bottom side of the bridge-one is typical for many Fender Telecasters for the pickup cavity and one is a small bit of a routing showing which was made to run a ground wire to the bridge screw-the routing for the ground wire is so it will sit below the bridge and not cause the bridge to stick up. CTS 250K pots. Vintage Fender wiring. Some copper ground foil installed on the body under the pickguard and on the bottom of the pickguard. A steel button string retainer installed and also has the original string retainer. Fender mylamar nut. Les Paul style jack plugin. No gig bag no case. I'll bubble wrap it for softer shipping. Fed Ex shipping. SIGNATURE REQUIRED ON DELIVERY. Someone will need to be at your location to sign upon delivery. It will not be left at your door or porch.
