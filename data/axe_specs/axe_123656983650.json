{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1989 Rickenbacker 620/12 Up for sale is a Ruby colored 1989 Rickenbacker 620-12. This is a players instrument 100%. It has all the various dings, scrapes and bruises you could ask for in a 30 year old instrument, and is a guitar meant to be played. There's a series of hairline cracks in the finish which is typical for this Ruby color. One thing I really like about this guitar is you can take it onstage and REALLY play it. With other Rickenbackers I've played I was always worried about scratching them or something. It's nice to play one and not have to worry about that. It has a blank Winfield Vintage Jackplate on it. The original serial number was I27169 (September 1989) So, how does it sound? Beatles, Byrds, The Jam, Petty, XTC...The list goes on and on. If you want that sound, you can only get it with a Rickenbacker 12 string. It doesn't have to be THIS Rickenbacker 12 string, but it does have to be a Rickenbacker 12 String. This guitar sounds sparkly and has an incredible amount of sustain. It sounds like it has a compressor built in to it. This is the only Rickenbacker 12 string I've ever had the pleasure of owning, so I don't know, maybe they all sound like this? In any case, I know why they say Rickenbacker's chime after hearing this one. Comes with a hardshell case, and will be packed well.
