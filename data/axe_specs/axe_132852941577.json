{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This 1997 Parker Fly Classic guitar is beautiful, lightweight and easy to play. It's been very gently used, in a non-smoking home. I asked a friend who plays much better than I do to try it out, and he had a great time. From Wikipedia: \"The Fly is unique among electric guitars in the way it uses composite materials. It is notable for its light weight (4.5 lb; 2.0 kg) and resonance. It was also one of the first electric guitars to combine traditional magnetic pickups with piezoelectric pickups, allowing the guitarist to access both acoustic and electric tones. ... The Fly has a vibrato system that allows the player to select from a fixed-bridge mode, a bend-down-only mode, and a free-float mode. The bridge has been designed to stay in perfect tune, even with heavy use of the vibrato bar. ... The Fly featured two magnetic Dimarzio Humbucker style pickups and a Fishman developed piezoelectric pickup designed to emulate acoustic guitar sounds. The piezoelectric pickup is aided by an onboard active pre-amplifier requiring the use of a 9 volt battery. ... The guitar was equipped with Sperzel tuners, which allow the string to be locked into place at the pole in which it winds. This feature allows the string to remain fastened into the pole without requiring more than one wind.\" The guitar has a few cosmetic blemishes (see photos). There is a ding on one edge of the mahogany body, and a tiny ding on the other edge. There is a scratch in the surface of the gloss black finish next to the top strap button. There used to be a Roland GK-2A synth pickup attached, and there are 2 small screw holes near the bridge that have been filled and color-matched. It comes with a sturdy padded gig-bag, the vibrato, the original stereo cable and an adjustment tool.", "ItemID": "132852941577", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T02:33:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T02:33:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Parker-Fly-Classic-Pre-Refined-Mahogany-Body-Free-Shipping-/132852941577", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Los Angeles, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328529415778080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTA=/z/Xi0AAOSw7Spb6OHK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eL8AAOSwQuZb6OHN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-z8AAOSwb-Rb6OHR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/F6sAAOSwjrFb6OHV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTI5WDE1OTI=/z/VGYAAOSwyodb6OHb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pa0AAOSwckVb6OHe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0CcAAOSwjNdb6OHi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2zUAAOSwhX5b6OHn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzM4WDE2MDA=/z/4QQAAOSw8cFb6OHq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIxMlgxNjAw/z/NfYAAOSwJTNb6OHs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDc2/z/u9wAAOSwVFJb6OHx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUzOFgxNTM2/z/qdIAAOSwUpFb6OHz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90027", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mjlogan", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 183, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 13, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1552.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1552.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 100}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Parker Fly Classic \u201cPre Refined\u201d Mahogany Body Free Shipping", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Parker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Classic"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 798, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1577.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
