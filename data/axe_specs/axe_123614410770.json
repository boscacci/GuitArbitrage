{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson 1999 ES-335 Dot Neck in Gloss Black/Ebony with its original Gibson Case. . Condition is Used. This is a 1999 Gibson ES-335 in Gloss Black/Ebony with its original Gibson Case. Serial Number 92149XXX. Complete model number from Gibson is ESDPEBNH1. The guitar is 100% Original in every way. No cracks, breaks, or previous repairs. This guitar is a player. This instrument is 20 years old and has some light buckle marks/scratches/swirls from playing throughout the body. Nothing deep or to the wood but there are light marks over the body. Electronics work as they should and sound great. Tone/volume knobs are free from scratchiness. Neck is good and truss rod moves freely. The one-piece neck is lenited in Gibson's specs as a \"1960 slim taper\" profile. It feels great, incredibly easy to chord in any style jazz, rock, blues and has enough heft to enhance sustain. Grover nickel tuning keys and the pickups are the '57 Classics which are a perfect match on this instrument! The binding has aged to a rich ivory/creme color. Original brown with pick interior hardshell case contains the original warranty and Gibson inspection slip. The case has a few small dings in the tolex, but overall in great condition as is the pick stain interior. Certainly a great sounding guitar that you can play in the studio or on the road without worry of dinging it up a bit.
