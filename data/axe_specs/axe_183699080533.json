{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Early 1974 Gibson Les Paul Custom with Walnut finish. This gorgeous Les Paul Custom is all original except for the upgraded tuners, one potentiometer, and the input jack. The finish appears to have a very professional refinish and looks fantastic. Everything else is original, including both pickups and the 3 other potentiometers. The guitar weighs 10.02 pounds and the neck thickness measures 0.802\" at the 1st fret and 1.001\" at the 12th fret. The original potentiometers with serial 1377401 date to the 1st week of 1974. While the serial number on the headstock could apply to 1970-1975 as well, it is widely reported that the pots were used in a timely manner from this era at Gibson. Guitar production wasn\u2019t nearly as fast paced during this period as it was in the 1960s, which meant Gibson ordered fewer parts at that time. This early '74 Les Paul Custom also features the engraved truss rod cover lettering, which was only used up until mid-1974 when they switched to painted lettering on the truss rod cover. It also features a transitional neck tenon, typical of Les Pauls made around '73-'75. This guitar is in excellent condition for its age and the finish on the pancake body looks outstanding with only minor marks. The top clear coat is still glossy. You can tell it has been well cared for its entire life. The original pickup covers have some beautiful patina, as does the gold bridge and tailpiece. This features a double-bound pancake body and all binding looks immaculate with only the tiniest amount of aged yellowing. The back of the body has light typical worming that can be seen under direct lighting. The finish on the back of the neck has faded a little just from playing. The neck is nice and smooth with only one very tiny fingernail mark. The Ebony fretboard looks great. The frets are very low and have wear. The frets have been dressed and polished to a bright shine, but It would probably benefit from a refret sometime in the future to bring the action down. The headstock looks great. The original Kluson tuners were replaced with vintage gold 70's-era Grovers Milk Bottle rotomatic tuners and was probably done back when the guitar was brand new. No holes were drilled for the tuners and could be cleanly reverted back to Klusons if desired. The bridge looks like an early 70's Stars Guitars tune-o-matic which could have been a special order. The input jack and jack plate were replaced long ago and the original input jack is included. The original bridge pickup was once replaced long ago but was reinstalled. All electronics work perfectly with zero scratchiness in the pots. The original pickups sound outstanding on this guitar. Includes a non-original hardshell case. The case works well. All latches work, as well as the handle. The exterior has some scuffs and marks from being in storage, and there is a sticker on the exterior. The interior of the case is in excellent condition. Like the Les Paul Standard, the Les Paul Custom was replaced with the SG body style at the end of 1960. The original Les Paul and Les Paul Custom were not brought back until 1968. Upon its reintroduction, the Les Paul Custom differed from those of the '50s in number of ways: the headstock was a slightly steeper angle, the control cavity in the body was cut in a different manner, and the neck tennon was longer. Starting in 1969, the Custom also adopted a multi-ply body construction with a Maple top like the Les Standard, where the original Les Paul Custom used an all Mahogany body.
