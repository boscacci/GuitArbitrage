{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I bought this guitar used in 1981. Since then it has played R&R, R&B and C&W and it's done it as well as I could do it. I added a Hot Rails style bridge pickup because it wasn't as harsh as the single coil and it over drove very well. The middle and neck pickups are overwound, Benson Custom pickups. High quality and wonderful tone. Also the wiring has been modded so that the first tone control next to the volume controls all three pickups. The original pots, etc., quit working long ago and have been replaced with quality components. The frets show very little wear as I have a very light touch on all my instruments. In spite of it's age, it has a long way to go before any significant work like fret replacement will be needed. The finish is about what you would expect. A number of nicks and dings and a finish crack or two. It has a lacquer finish hence the cracks. The tremolo has a Wilkinson block which uses a 'push-in' type lever. This eliminates the screwing and unscrewing that eventually screws up the threads. Much better arrangement. Also has it's original case The inside top of the case has a cutout in the foam to accept the tremolo lever eliminating the need to remove it to put the guitar into the case and close it up. The guitar is well set up and of course you can use it on gigs right out of the box. If you win this, I personally wish you your version of all the god times I had with it.
