Available for auction is a 2016 Gibson Les Paul Traditional. The Les Paul Traditional 2016 T's foundation is the same traditional tonewood combination that helped make the Les Paul a legend when it was introduced six decades ago. A traditional pickup wind in the neck position provides plenty of warmth and clarity, and in the bridge position, slightly over-wound coils in the '57 Classic Plus offer wailing lead tones. This guitar is in excellent 95% +++ condition and comes in the original Gibson case with case candy. This Gibson plays like a dream but has been played very little. \u00a0 \u00a0 (See Pictures For Better Details) Pictures are of the actual item being auctioned. We never use stock photographs.
