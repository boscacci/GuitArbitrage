{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for grabs is a Fender Strat parts-caster. The body is Made in Mexico, it is finished in Sonic Blue lacquer. The neck I bought here on eBay, it is not a Fender made neck from what I can tell, or is it a licensed neck. It came to me like it is with the Fender decal and the finish on it. That being said it is very nice neck, no sharp frets, low/high frets, just like a Strat neck should feel. The pickups are Fender Tex-Mex, CTS pots, orange drop cops, the bridge is a lower end aftermarket like GFS or something, it does works well. The Tuners are the staggered length, Fender \"F\" brand. It plays great, it sounds great, was just set up by Space Guitar of Cleveland,Ohio. The body has a finish crack in the back, see photo's. It was purchased this way, I put 2 wood screws into the back of the body to hold it in place just in case. As always, lacquer hides nothing and the crack is small but present. In a year or so since the refinish it has NOT changed from what you can see in the photo's. There is some chipping in the finish around the neck pocket, see photos. The finish is gloss with typical minor handling marks/scratches.Otherwise it is a very nice player, stays in tune, great intonation, neck feels great in hand, medium large frets, plays and sounds like a Strat should. Will ship within 1 day of auction ending/payment received, solidly packed, in a slightly used Fender gig bag.
