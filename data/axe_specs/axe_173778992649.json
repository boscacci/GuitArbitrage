{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Rare 1991 Fender Heartfield RR9. Designed in the USA. Made in Japan (Fujigen). This was built as a top of the line Pro Quality guitar. Alder body. Maple neck. Rosewd. board. Gotoh Japan tuners. Tremolo with arm. Master tone & volume. Active on board EQ with push button controls for single coil, humbucker, and full distortion modes. Button Controls are adjustable so that you can dial in your sounds. This guitar is in overall good condition. It does have some normal wear, a couple of chips in the paint (as shown), and an extra tuner hole that I can see. All that being said this is still a very sharp looking guitar. The neck is straight, the truss rod is working smoothly, and there is very little if any board or fret wear. This one is a REAL PLAYER. The action is low and the neck is smooth and fast. KILLER SOUND!!! Will ship in a padded gig bag that is worn but will help protect this FANTASTIC GUITAR. Thanks for looking ! Shipping to lower 48 only !!! Unless prior arrangements are made.
