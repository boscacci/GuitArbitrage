{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "VINTAGE 1960's / EALY 70's ARIA (UNIVOX) OFFSET ELECTRIC GUITAR WITH ORIGINAL CASE Up for bids is an interesting old Japanese guitar that I think is from the late 60's or maybe the early 70's. The logo is missing from the head but it appears to be an Aria Diamond, or perhaps the very similar Univox UC-3 model. It features a very offset body shape and it has three single coil pickups. There is a three way selector switch, tone and volume knobs, and a tone switch that actually gives it a wide range of sounds. It's in decent shape for its age, showing the usual mostly small nicks and dings from use. I'm including close up photos showing the two worst wear spots on the side and bottom edge of the guitar. All three pickups and all of the controls work as they should. It has the typical twangy Japanese single coil sound but does respond well to overdrive or distortion. The neck is straight and it plays fine. The frets are on the smaller side so it's not really a shredder but would be great for surf, grunge or punk use. It is missing the tremelo arm, the knobs look newer and a couple of the bridge height adjustment screws are mis-matched. The guitar comes with appears to be the original chipboard case that fits the exaggerated offset shape perfectly. Check out the many photos above and bid to win. U.S. shipping will be $50 (more to Alaska and Hawaii).
