{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Little used Good condition Gibson Johnny A for sale. No dings identified, normal playing marks on front and few belt scratches on back. Never left my smoke/pet free house, time to sell. Comes with nice alligator Gibson hard shell case and certificate of authenticity. More pictures upon request. Free shipping in US. From his years with J. Geils Band front man Peter Wolf to his acclaimed solo albums, Johnny A.'s passion for the guitar is proverbial. Gibson recognized Johnny's talents and created theJohnny A. Signature Model. The Johnny A. Signature Model combines the best of vintage Gibsons with innovative designs to create a guitar that is pretty unique. The body is completely hollow with a carved maple top. The outer surface is contoured to look and feel like a traditional hollowbody guitar, but the inner back is flat, cutting down on feedback and imparting a bright, snappy response. The custom neck profile and pearl inlays are coupled with more traditional Gibson features such as multi-ply binding, gold hardware, a Bigsby tailpiece, and an ebony fingerboard to create a guitar that's diving headfirst into the future while giving a knowing nod to the past.
