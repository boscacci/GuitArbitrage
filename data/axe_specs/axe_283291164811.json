Mint Condition - the plastic is still on the pickguard and backplate. ******************************************************************************TREY\u2019S AWESOME GUITARS - STORE POLICIES: AVAILABILITY: If you send me a message, I think you will find that I am very responsive; I attempt to do so. One exception is that on Saturdays, I am not available most of the day because this is my day to get away from it all, however when I return on Saturday evening, I will respond to any messages or offers. I also do not generally respond after 9pm EST any day, however I generally do respond early the next morning. DESCRIPTION OF GUITARS: I endeavor to describe guitars as accurately as possible. Most guitars have some clearcoat scratches and swirling on them; I do not generally attempt to photo these as they are very difficult to capture and generally do not accurately represent what they look like once you receive the guitar. I am very picky about pointing out imperfections and use; I very rarely classify a guitar as Mint Condition. When you get the guitar, I want you to experience satisfaction that it was exactly as described. I know I am very unhappy when I receive a guitar that was not as described. PACKAGING: I endeavor to pack up my guitars so they are safe and secure on the way to you. I cannot guarantee that the shipping company will not damage it, however I try to minimize that as much as possible. I use new or like new boxes that are heavy-duty; some boxes that are described as heavy-duty are not really. I do not prefer shipping boxes that have been folded in half, however, if I use them, I will secure the fold well. I attempt to follow all recommended guidelines in packing them up. SHIPPING: I generally say that I will ship within one (1) business day, however I try to ship as quick as possible. Many times, I ship the same day especially if I receive the order early that day. Please note, however, that I am very picky about my packaging, and I take the time required to pack it up good. If the guitar is valued over $1,000.00, it will take me a little longer as it will be insured, and I am required to take it to the Customer Center, and this is further away from my location. SATISFACTION: I definitely want you to be satisfied on your purchase. I have been selling on eBay for awhile, and thanks to my awesome customers, I have earned and maintain a 100% rating for guitars.", "ItemID": "283291164811", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T14:34:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T13:13:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-American-Special-Stratocaster-2017-Sunburst-Mint-Condition-/283291164811", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Johns Island, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832911648118080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/SOoAAOSwFs1cB84O/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NDA=/z/p9UAAOSwB19cB84Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/LdMAAOSw7HhcB84j/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/WqoAAOSwZKJcB84u/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2Mjc=/z/JisAAOSwFZZcB843/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMTU0/z/A8YAAOSwXItcB85G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/7W0AAOSwsQJcB85T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/8jEAAOSwj5BcB85e/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mjg=/z/SQEAAOSwPGtcB85n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODM2WDE2MDA=/z/LIoAAOSwRWZcB85z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29455", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "treys-awesome-guitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 437, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 116}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender American Special Stratocaster (2017), Sunburst, Mint Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Special"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 266, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Mint Condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
