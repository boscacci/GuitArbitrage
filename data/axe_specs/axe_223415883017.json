{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2014 Fender 60th Anniversary American Vintage Stratocaster in VG++ Condition. Fender really nailed the '54 vibe with this one...probably one of their most accurate reissues including specially designed '54 pickups with rounded polystyrene covers, \"tallboy\" knobs, \"football\" switch tip, rounded headstock edges, \"Fender Pat. Pend\" stamped bridge saddles, round string tree, vintage correct single-ply pickguard, and backplate with round holes. The guitar plays perfectly and sounds beautiful. The pickups in this guitar are really nice. It's set-up with GHS David Gilmour 10's, and has the comfortable '54 U-shaped neck, 7 1/4\" radius, and vintage frets. This is a GREAT Strat!...also not much difference between this and a Fender Custom Shop. Cosmetics: This guitar has 3 paint chips on the top edge of the body (see last pic). Otherwise clean shape. The frets are also excellent. Includes orig. Fender \"Center-Pocket\" Tweed case, Certificate, trem bar, and all the factory accessories shown...tons of case candy with this guitar.From Fender: The two-piece ash body features a side seam and a flash-coat lacquer finish in the guitar\u2019s original 2-Color Sunburst.
