{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I purchased this extraordinary instrument from a prominent vintage guitar dealer 6 years ago. When I received and inspected it, I was amazed at the absolutely \"like new\" condition it was in, down to the unused case candy original tweed Fender strap in the accessories compartment. It had the original strings on it and obviously hadn't been played much, so I took it to Lyrical Lumber, my local luthier, who did a professional set up on it. It plays and sounds really great. While he was working on it, he called me up and asked if I wanted him to remove the protective coating from the back plastic cover (see my pic#8). I said no, leave it there to show how untouched this guitar is. In my 6 years of ownership, I don't think it's spent more than a few days all together out of the case under the bed. These American Standards have been gaining in value over the years and are now poised to make a big jump in collectability and value. The best judge of the true value of any item is what they have sold for recently. Check out item #.The exact same guitar as this one, but not as clean and \"minty\", sold for $1100. Will be shipped upon receipt of payment to a USA buyer in the lower 48.On Feb-19-19 at 12:41:47 PST, seller added the following information: OOPs!
