{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Charvel CX390 Jackson Super Strat Dimarzio Tone Pro Neck PUP Double Locking Trem. Condition is Used. Bridge pickup has been replaced with a DiMarzio Tone Pro. The lower tremolo thread insert has been repaired. The wood was cracked and repaired with glue or epoxy. This repair was done before I got the guitar, so I don\u2019t know exactly what happened. I have had other guitars with the same repairs, and in my opinion, it does not effect the way it plays. The guitar is used and has a few small nicks and dings. The neck is lightly discolored near the fingerboard on both sides. Please message me if you need more pics. SELLING AS IS WITH NO WARRANTY. TREMOLO STUD INSERT HAS BEEN REPAIRED AMD GLUED BACK IN. Stand in pics is not included. Guitar will be professionally packaged and shipped with insurance.
