{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a really great guitar: a 2016 Gibson SG Naked. This was a limited run, produced in two colors \u2014 the \"walnut\" finish shown here, with the cream pickup covers and knobs, and the \"natural\" finish (looks kinda orange) with black pickup covers and knobs. This version looks the best, if you ask me. SPECIAL FEATURES:\u2022 Solid mahogany body and neck with \"walnut\" finish \u2014 really nice woodgrain on this one. \u2022 Super-slim-taper Angus Young profile neck, with a nut only 1.65 inches wide. This is slender, folks. If you have large hands, this may not be the guitar for you. \u2022 No binding; simple dot inlaid fret markers \u2022 24-fret rosewood fretboard\u2022 Gibson P-90 single-coil pickups with cream covers\u2022 Gold top-hat style volume and tone controls\u2022 Grover Rotomatic tuners, chome-plated \u2022 Gibson Tune-o-Matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece, chrome-plated \u2022 Oversize aluminum strap buttons CONDITIONThere is a very light scratch across the back that you can see in the last photo. You have to tilt the guitar to the light to really notice it. I photographed it from different angles so you could see it better. Let me know if you need other pictures. Other than that, it's in excellent condition. No other dents, chips, cracks, breaks, scuffs, stains, scratches, buckle rash. No repairs or modifications. Low action, plays like a dream. Also, very light. I get 6.2 pounds on my bathroom scale. That may not be 100% accurate, but it certainly FEELS lighter than my other SGs. The previous owner put it in a nice hardshell case. It's a generic model, not Gibson-branded, but it fits well and does the job. There are a few small white scuffs on the lid (see photos), but otherwise very good condition. Nice and clean inside and out. Black plush interior with chrome hardware. Latches, hinges, and handle work fine. $40 for FEDEX GROUND OR HOME DELIVERY SHIPPING to anywhere in the continental USA. Sorry, but no international bidders. Delivery to confirmed PayPal addresses only. I promise to pack it carefully and will do my best to ship it within 24 hours of your payment. A signature will be required for delivery. Let me know if you have any questions at all.
