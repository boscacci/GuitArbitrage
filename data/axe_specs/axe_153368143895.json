{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a Yamaha SJ550HR in good and clean shape. These are very high quality and are Made in Japan. Very beautiful mix of a yellow/brown color. These were made in the 1980's. This one is not as heavy as some of the other models, which will make it easier on your back. This has some scratches, both front and back and a few small dings, the worst of which on the side, one on the front as well as one on back. This is a great feeling neck with large frets. Includes all strings except the last string, smallest one. Typical wear shows on the guitar, with some light scratching on the body and a few shallow dings on the back of the neck. The bridge hardware has some corrosion on it, as do the pickup covers. Overall a touch up pen would take care of most of the minor ware.... The guitar has a lot of versatility and plays very smoothly.", "ItemID": "153368143895", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T02:33:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-07T02:48:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Yamaha-SJ550-HR-Electric-Guitar-/153368143895", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Riverside, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533681438958080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mlUAAOSwAdhcW5uP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KUsAAOSwcyVcW5uX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ntgAAOSwrw1cW5tw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~oAAAOSwCrtcW5t7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lFYAAOSwoG1cW5tz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~n0AAOSwCrtcW5t2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QEIAAOSwHQxcW5ue/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "92503", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "used-appliance-parts", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 61, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.4}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 288.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 288.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 241}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Yamaha SJ550 HR Electric Guitar ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Yamaha"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 55, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
