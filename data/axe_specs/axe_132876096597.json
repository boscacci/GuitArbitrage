{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Please note the guitar comes with a strap I bought to match the cool blue and I'll put it in a soft case when I mail it. Feel free to send me any questions Thanks!!! Here's the manufacturer's description of the guitar. I highly suggest researching the guitar it's got great reviews, it's awesome I just never have time to play and prefer acoustic guitar when I do play. Enjoy!! A cool-looking solidbody with upgraded pickups and electronics. In 1957 Gibson purchased New Yorks Epiphone Guitar Company and moved production to Kalamazoo, Michigan. With plans to expand retail distribution by differentiating Epiphone dealers from Gibson dealers, Gibson began production of a new line of \u0153Kalamazoo-made and designed\ufffd Epiphones in 1959. For over a decade, Epiphone solid body guitars and basses were produced right alongside Gibsons. These Epiphone guitars represented some of the highest quality and best sounding instruments of their generation. They provided unique shapes, pickup arrangements, and tonal signatures not seen on comparable Gibson models of the day. Under appreciated at the time of their release, numerous artists through the years have recognized the unique appeal of these guitars. Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter, Paul Gilbert and Steve Marriot are but a few of the artists that have embraced the tone and build quality of these Kalamazoo built Epiphones. One such Epiphone instrument was the Wilshire. Like an SG guitar, the Wilshires double cutaway mahogany body with a glued-in mahogany neck that joins the body at the 22nd fret gives you ultimate upper fret access. Lightweight and comfortable, the Wilshire has excellent resonance and natural acoustic tone \u201c even unplugged. Featuring Epiphones LockTone tune-o-matic/stopbar combination, the transfer of string vibration is improved even more giving this guitar excellent sustain and clarity. Case sold separately. PRO Electronics Utilizing Epiphone's 4-wire humbuckers, each volume control is a push/pull potentiometer that allows you to coil-tap each pickup seperately for more twangy \"single-coil\" sound and a wide range of different tonal combinations. While 1960's early Wilshires were fitted with Epiphone's own mini-humbuckers, the new Wilshire PRO harkens back to Wilshires made in the 1970's and features full size humbuckers. The neck pickup is Epiphone's Alnico Classic that provides warm and subtle tone with a full, even response that doesn't hold back when you need that classic humbucker crunch. An Alnico Classic Plus, which is the perfect companion to the Classic, is overwound for a slighter higher output without sacrificing its rich, vintage tone. Both feature Alnico-II magnets, enamel wire and are double vacuum waxed. Retro Looks Also unique, the Wilshire features Epiphones own \u0153batwing\ufffd headstock. A classic design that improves tuning ease and accuracy by offering a straight string-pull design, the headstock is adorned like the original with the vintage \u0153Epiphone\ufffd logo in gold. Other features include a 1960s SlimTaper neck profile with rosewood fingerboard, premium 14:1 die-cast tuners and individual Volume and Tone controls for each pickup.
