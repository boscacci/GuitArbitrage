{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a guitar I just bought few weeks ago to help charity tha auctioned it and for curiosity about this guitar and brand. I am relisting it as a full charity auction. It is a great guitar, better than my expectations and had heared good thing. I have access to the original maker G----n SG and surprised at how great this compares to it, plus has prettier inlays! Like the fact that has a maple neck not like original makers weak mahogany neck that will snap if you drop it. This guitar is set up ready to gig. A little tarnish on the gold hardware that is to be expected, see pictures, an almost inpercetable and unphotographable little dent in paint on back. A great demo of this model is found on Youtube by Pistol Pete. Would keep it but do not need it have dozens of guitars Comes with a soft gig bag. Great Christmas present or find a poor young talent to give it forward to. PS- was lazy so some of pictures are from the original auction. Internationals SORRY appears due to CITES rules since maple... Ebay will not allow it to go to you.
