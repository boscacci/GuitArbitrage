{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx,no PO Boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement. I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Strat\" Gilmore style. The Squier maple neck has near zero fret wear ,and has had a nice headstock make over with many coats of cleat over the decal. The previous owner had put different tuners on at one time but now the tuners are back to the original Squier tuners. You can see where I filled the holes left over on the back of the headstock. The very cool Gloss Black Body looks very nice,has a few tiny pin head size chips to the finish,otherwise mild surface scratches. The pickups has been upgraded with SEM single coil pickups. The guitar has been wired for tone control on all three pickups.The bridge and neck pickups both work with the neck pickups tone control. Nice to have tone control on the bridge pickup,makes it a lot more versatile. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The capacitor has been upgraded with a .022 Orange Drop style epoxy film capacitor . More range of tone control and a smoother response. Action is good and guitar plays very nicely. This guitar sounds really good,and it looks like a classic. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
