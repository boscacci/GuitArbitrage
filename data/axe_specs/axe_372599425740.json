{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Normal 0 The king of solid body guitars, the Les Paul Custom made its debut in 1954 after the initial success of the Les Paul Goldtop. Les Paul himself suggested black as a great color for a new Les Paul because it looked \"classy\" and went well with a tuxedo on stage. Now with its ebony or antique white finish, the Les Paul Custom has often been referred to as the \"tuxedo\" Les Paul. And with its gold appointments, fully bound body, neck and headstock and mother-of-pearl inlays, we think you'll agree that the Epiphone Les Paul Custom is \"dressed to kill\". Now featuring ProBucker 2 and ProBucker 3 humbucking pickups, gold hardware, multi-binding on body (top and back), neck and headstock as well as split-diamond pearloid headstock and fretboard inlays, it's as gorgeous as it is deadly. INCLUDES: 2015 Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro Electric Guitar and Pre-Owned Soft Black Case. (No box, manual, or any additional accessories) *Stand not included with auction* 14 DAY NO HASSLE RETURNS! No partial refunds.

Guitar is pre-owned but appears to have been taken care of well.  It does show signs of use such as a few minor nicks and scuffs to body but again minor and just worth noting.  Gold hardware has some fading especially to the pickups and tuners. Neck is straight. Installed a brand new set of Super Slinky guitar strings while testing the guitar.
