{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Thank you for taking the time to look at this very nice guitar.The guitar is all original.I had the guitar pro set up, and it plays like a dream.Low action, great frets, and a beautiful range of sound.No signs of fret wear, and a very nice fret board.Has new Clear-tone strings. I love the sound of this guitar, but after 50 years of being a guitar player, I am just set in my ways and love my Les Pauls. There are two spots on the guitar one next to each strap button, where it appears that someone had moved the buttons.I tried to show them in the photos, but they are hard to see.Other than that and the missing paint on the two fins, there are normal signs of use. All very minor. I am sorry, but the case is not included, It is for a bass guitar I own.I assure you that the guitar will be very well packed for shipping.This is being sold as is, so please look at the pictures, and ask any question.Look at my feedback and you will see that I try to be as exact as I can.", "ItemID": "254055698479", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T16:13:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T16:13:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-JS32T-King-V-/254055698479", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Freeport, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540556984798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YgcAAOSwyUFcCCVa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PpcAAOSwt~1cCCVt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f1wAAOSwxtVcCCV~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6t8AAOSwrZBcCCWU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KlkAAOSw6~pcCCWs/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Wp4AAOSwqlxcCCXC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nmcAAOSw29JcCCXW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0DYAAOSwYXpcCCXq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PcMAAOSwFx5cCCX9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "61032", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ranger69black", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1048, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 7, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 117.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 117.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 378}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "  Jackson JS32T King V", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["King V"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 194, "Subtitle": "Pro Set UP  Sounds Great!!!!!", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 120.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar us used and does have signs of being played, but all scratches and marks are very minor.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
