{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great condition on this very recent (2017) Les Paul Classic. Has Grover locking tuners, Plus Top, great slim & flat 60's profile neck and it's original hardshell case. Just used at the house for recordings. Never took it out to a gig. Here's a cut-n-paste from the Gibson site to tell you more about the model: Les Paul Classic Utter the phrase \u201cLes Paul Standard\u201d and most players will bring a clear visual and sonic image instantly to mind. For the rockers among us, chances are that this vision will embody the Les Paul Classic Plus from Gibson USA, a powerful embodiment of a legendary guitar that looks every lick as good as it sounds. Crafted from premium tonewoods, the Les Paul Classic Plus carries a highly figured Grade-AA maple top, which looks absolutely stunning beneath your choice of Vintage Sunburst, Heritage Cherry Sunburst, Trans Ebony Burst or Manhattan Midnight finish, all in high-gloss, hand-sprayed nitrocellulose lacquer. Classic Les Paul Standard appointments such as acrylic trapezoid fingerboard inlays and cream body and neck binding are accompanied by a deceptively powerful pair of humbucking pickups mounted \u201copen-coil\u201d for a modified look that sits great with the guitar\u2019s lack of pickguard, which also serves to show off the Les Paul Classic Plus\u2019s gorgeous wood. And, to top it all off, players can choose their preference of rounded \u201950s or slim \u201960s neck profile. As with the best Les Pauls crafted since the early \u201950s, the Les Paul Classic Plus starts with the legendary tonewood pairing of a solid carved Grade-AA maple top glued to a Grade-A mahogany body. Marrying maple\u2019s clarity and definition to mahogany\u2019s richness and depth produces a tonal complexity that no single-wood guitar has ever matched. Its resonance and sustain are only further enhanced by the deep-set quarter-sawn mahogany neck with 17-degree back-angled headstock. Optimum playability is ensured by your choice of rounded \u201950s or slim \u201960s neck profile and a 12-inch fingerboard radius for choke-free string bending. The guitar\u2019s 22-fret fingerboard is made from baked maple, a heat-treated hardwood that offers a clear tone and extreme durability. To pump up all this tonal goodness to the max, Gibson loads the Les Paul Classic Plus with a pair of its hottest humbucking pickups. The 496R in the neck position is wound with 42-AWG wire like a traditional PAF for rich, warm, vocal-like tones, but carries a ceramic magnet for enhanced punch and clarity. The 500T in the bridge pickup is a more formidable beast altogether, wound with finer 43-AWG wire to pack the coils to the max and built with a ceramic magnet for scorching leads, endless sustain and willing feedback. A pairing of Tune-o-matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece ensures solid sustain and accurate intonation, while a set of vintage-style TonePros\u2122 tuners with pearloid buttons looks great and makes tune-up a breeze.", "ItemID": "233026940490", "EndTime": "2018-12-03T06:12:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-30T06:12:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2017-Gibson-Les-Paul-Classic-T-Heritage-Cherry-Original-Case-excellent-/233026940490", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Louisville, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330269404908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rCcAAOSwZupb95fC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YNQAAOSw5tNb95e~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dOoAAOSwV3hb95fG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SHgAAOSw3fxb95fJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xFAAAOSwRWZb95fM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lXsAAOSw-V1b95fR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BLUAAOSw-2hb95fP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nOsAAOSw5UFb95fU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/65YAAOSwiE1b95fa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p3sAAOSwhfRb95fX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G68AAOSwrpJb95fd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "40272", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kapparaider", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 786, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.8}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2017 Gibson Les Paul Classic T - Heritage Cherry-Original Case-excellent", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Classical"]}]}, "HitCount": 113, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
