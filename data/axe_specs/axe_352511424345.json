{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1977 GIBSON LES PAUL PROserial number: 72627580 (last digit is slightly under tuner so it could be a 0 or a 6)included: Road Runner soft-hard case....I don't know what it is called..it has soft material on the outside but a thick hard molded foam core..looks safe enough to fly with.original pickups were replaced with vintage Dimarzio. check out photos. it doesn't look like any routing was done...there are some small shims glued in place so the humbucker frame screws have something to hold. I think this guitar originally had P90's.the guitar shows wear, but no major flaws. The maple neck has paint wear from playing. The fret wear is evident, but there are no gouges and no flat spots. The back of the body has numerous buckle marks and what note, the outer sides have some small dings.there is an extra hole for the strap buttonthere is some electronic weirdness: let me explain: there is a switch added that you can see, but the switch does not do anything that I can hear. The volume pots work perfectly as they should. the tone pots are kind of weird: when maxed out at full the tone is slightly cut, roll back the tone knob and the tone is at full treble mode....so I would say at 10 position the tone is actuality at 7, then rolled back to about 7 it is at 10.play-ability is excellent...it has .009 strings on it...... so kinda light for my taste, but it plays fast and clean, excellent tone.in my opinion this is a beautiful guitar with all the sweet love a 1970's guitar should have but no abuse .....no disasters.....you could use as it is, it is ready to rock. TERMS OF SALE: guaranteed excellent working-sounding-playing 1977 Gibson Les Paul, has the usual wear and tear but no major damage, has some electronic modification as noted.
