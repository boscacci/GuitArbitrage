From blues to jazz to rock and beyond, the maple body offers tones that are bright and snappy, but not harsh. Pair that with the set mahogany neck and rosewood fingerboard - which bring a touch of thickness and warmth to the tone - and you've got a well-balanced instrument for any genre.Classic P-90 pickups deliver tonal versatilityA pair of single-coil P-90 pickups are the engine that drives the power of the Casino. P-90 pickups are unique, as they sparkle and shimmer when you pick gently, but they can get mean when you really lean into them. This puts you a myriad of tones at your disposal, including the patented Beatles jangle that was so prevalent across many of their classic tunes.1960s SlimTaper \"D\" neck profile for smooth playabilityThe 1960s SlimTaper \"D\" neck profile is designed for fast and smooth playability. Thinner than '50s-style necks, this neck profile stays out of the way for fast leads while still being comfortable for rhythm playing.
