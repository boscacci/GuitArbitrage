{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Washburn Tour 24 black and red telecaster guitar is in nice shape, even with a couple broken paint bumps. Lots of pick swirling with some scratches and a couple dink\u2019s one small one on the neck. Not bad but it is there. (I tried to take a picture) Please use the pictures for a large part of the description. I played this one a lot by the wear on the neck and it\u2019s wear overall. This guitar has had the tremolo from a Jackson guitar installed, not sure why or when. No trem bar and the Locking nut for the tremolo was taken off and the strap buttons are missing on this guitar. The original case is in solid shape, but the inside pocket fell out long ago. The interior is still soft and nice though. There may be some scratches and tolex dink\u2019s but this whole rig is 20+ years old. This is a highly coveted and hard to find model of this guitar. This was a regular player until about five years ago or so. It has been kept in its case in a controlled environment while I have owned it. Could use a good cleaning of the pots but it still plays and sounds great. This is a used item that may take some work or love to make it fit your style or playing personality. That being said, no guarantee is given or implied, I will only ship to the lower 48 states.
