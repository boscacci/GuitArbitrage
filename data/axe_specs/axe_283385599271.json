{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ibanez S670QM Electric Guitar, 2017 Saphire Blue, Mahogany Body, Maple Neck. Condition is Used. FREE SHIPPING!!! (The price has been dropped, and this is as low as I'll go with this guitar. FREE SHIPPING STILL APPLIES!!!) 2017 was the last year with a Rosewood fretboard before it got changed to Jatoba, and 2018 was the last year with a Mahogany body before it got changed to Meranti. That means THIS IS THE LAST YEAR WITH \"PREFERRED TONEWOODS!!!\" I've included a picture of the back of the headstock with the last 5 digits of the serial number covered (for my protection). If you look up Ibanez serial numbers online, you will see that the first digit represents \"country of origin\" (Indonesia), the next 2 digits are the year (2017), and the next 2 digits are the month (03 = March). The final 5 digits are the actual \"serial number\" for that specific guitar. This is proof that it is a Mahogany body / Rosewood fretboard guitar...AND IBANEZ IS MAKING CHANGES ACROSS THE BOARD!!! This is not the only model that Ibanez is changing to alternate tonewoods!!! This guitar weighs 6 lbs, 14 oz (6.875 lbs...3.12 Kg). I put this guitar on a scale, and that is how much this particular guitar weighs. This is very light for a solid body electric guitar! The reason is because of the contoured shape...both front and back. The contours make it very comfortable to play. The comfort in playing is not just because of it's light weight but also because of the way that it contours to the body. I've included a side view picture comparing this S670QM to my PRS so that you can see how thin it is on the edges. There is very little signs of wear on this guitar, it's in very good condition. I put new strings on this guitar, it's in standard tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E). The strings are \"Cleartone Heavy Series\" light top / heavy bottom (10 - 52). I also cleaned the fretboard and used Old English Lemon Oil on the fretboard when I did the string change. I put \"Fast Fret\" on the strings to protect them from the elements during shipping. If they feel too slick, just wipe them down. The guitar is in factory condition with the stock Ibanez pickups (Quantum Series), stock wiring, stock tuners, and stock tremolo bridge (Ibanez Edge Zero II). There is no tremolo bar included with this guitar. Trem bars are available pretty much everywhere. -Mahogany Body / Quilted Maple Top (Sapphire Blue)-1 piece Wizard III Maple Neck-Bound Rosewood Fretboard-24 frets-25.5\" Scale-Dual Humbuckers (Ibanez Quantum Series)-Single Coil Middle Pickup (Ibanez Quantum Series)-Edge Zero II Tremolo-Locking Nut FREE SHIPPING!!!
