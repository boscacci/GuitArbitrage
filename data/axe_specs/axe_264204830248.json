{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is a rare bird for sure. I calling this as a semi-hollow, it's actually a hybrid hollowbody. There is a solid center block under the bridge and pickup, but it morphs into a hollowbody in the remainder. The result is something you can rock with, but will produce some great jazzier tones at the neck position. The word is that these particular guitars were, in fact, made by the respected Peerless Korea shop. And the fit and finish of this guitar bears that out, it's top-notch. Beautiful fret work, multi-ply binding all around, definitely not a mass-produced hack job here, folks. I thought about replacing the electronics, the surprise was that it wasn't necessary. The guitar sounds fantastic in it's all-stock condition. There is some discoloration of the gold appointments consistent with any used guitar, but it is extremely clean, no visible dings or chips. Everything in good working order, no fret wear, etc. The Guardian jumbo hardshell case shown is included. Ask any questions that you might have in advance. USA shipping only. Please check my other auctions for more quality guitars.
