{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Epiphone ES-175 Custom Shop Limited Edition VS Used. I took this guitar in as a partial trade with the intent of reselling. It is a fine guitar with no problems, it is just going toward another deal already made. So I played the guitar for about an hour to make sure there were no glitches and she is good to go. The only 'defect' I can find in the guitar is a small plugged hole (pictured) where the previous owner installed a strap pin near the base of the neck. Otherwise there are no major defects. If you need any other views or pictures do not hesitate to ask and I can add them to the posting. She is a very nice guitar and sounds very sweet. I will consider all offers and will ship via FedEx for $60.
