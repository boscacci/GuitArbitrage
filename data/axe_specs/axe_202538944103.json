Most have no flaws at all. Any that had blemishes have been restored by an expert luthier and I am careful to report as accurately as I can anything that has been refinished. They are stamped with a tiny \"used\" on the back of headstock and serial partially removed to prevent dishonest dealers from selling you an instrument claiming it is warranteed. What you get is a brand name, quality instrument for a fraction of the cost.Features\u00b7 Body Type:Solid body \u00b7 Body Shape:Les Paul \u00b7 Left-/Right-handed:Right-handed \u00b7 Number of Strings:6 \u00b7 Body Material:Mahogany \u00b7 Top Material:Quilt Maple \u00b7 Body Finish:Gloss \u00b7 Color:Midnight Sapphire \u00b7 Neck Material:Mahogany, Set \u00b7 Neck Shape:SpeedTaper D-profile \u00b7 Radius:14\" \u00b7 Fingerboard Material:Rosewood \u00b7 Fingerboard Inlay:Mother of Pearl and Abalone Block and Triangle \u00b7 Number of Frets:24, Jumbo \u00b7 Scale Length:24.75\" \u00b7 Nut Width:1.687\" \u00b7 Nut Material:Graphite \u00b7 Bridge/Tailpiece:LockTone Tune-o-Matic/LockTone Stopbar \u00b7 Tuners:Sealed \u00b7 Number of Pickups:2 \u00b7 Neck Pickup:EMG-85 Humbucker \u00b7 Bridge Pickup:EMG-81 Humbucker \u00b7 Controls:2 x volume, 2 x tone, 3-way toggle pickup switch BACK OF HEADSTOCK stamped used as required by all MFGS before releasing any instrument for resale to void false warranty claims \u00b7 Bid with confidence! Here's what some folks have emailed me, commenting on their guitars:\u00b7 \"Marilyn, I just got the guitar and plugged into my amp. It sounds and plays wonderfully thanks for your good eye in finding these bargains. Truly the best item Ive purchased on ebay. Hope to do business with you in the future.\" -George \u00b7 \"Marilyn, Once again you have outdone yourself. The Fender is absolutely gorgeous ! ! ! ! Thanks again. It really is nice to have someone on ebay that is completely trustworthy. It has been a pleasure emailing you. Have a great summer.\" -Tom\u00b7 \"I just received the guitar. WOW ! I thought I bid on a used one. No way is this used! I would have bid 10 times more if I knew how excellent it is ! My son LOVES it ! Thank you sooooo much ! U have got too stress on your site how fine these are ! Not stressed enough ! Worth alot more. I\"M NOT complaining, but u can get more for another one like this ! Highly recommended, Thank you,\" - Theresa\u00b7 \"Marilyn....Got it!! My son was very pleased, Guitar looks very nice, I can't see why it had to be labeled used, obviously nothing that I could see and neither could my son, perfect for someone getting started and better quality than a truly used guitar. Thanks!\" -Perry\u00b7 \u00b7 I will only sell guitars I would like to own myself. I stand behind what I sell and will accept a return if you are not satisfied for full refund less shipping provided the guitar is returned insured, in the same packaging you received it in, and packed for return just as you received it. Instruments that have been altered or tampered with in any way cannot be returned- sorry! Shipping includes double boxing, ample padding, and insurance (packaging alone costs me over $10!)\u00b7 About Shipping costs: The size of the box makes shipping any guitar pretty pricey. Packaging alone cost over $10. I charge less for shipping than my actual costs in an effort to offer you the best possible deal on a quality instrument! I pay for insurance, and signature required delivery as well as quality heavy duty box and packing materials- I go the extra mile to make sure your guitar arrives perfectly! Shipping to Alaska, Hawaii and international is additonal-please provide postal code for quote.
