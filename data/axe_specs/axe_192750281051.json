{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The bad: I bought this from my friend who was the original guitarist in Shinedown. It spent time touring the world and it has nicks, swirls, dings, scratches and every other type of wear associated with being played on several songs a night for 200 or so shows (frets are still great though). Some of the pictures almost look like a green finish but it is Trans-gray.The worse: It suffered a broken headstock. When I bought the guitar, it was on condition that he return it to DTM to repair the headstock himself. He agreed and about a month later, Mr. McNaught mailed the guitar to me. Since the back of the headstock is natural, the work could not be hidden with paint and you can of course see the repair. Mr. McNaught did an excellent job and signed his name over the repair. It is solid and does not affect the guitar in any way, other than the visual. The good: It is an amazing guitar built by the Master. It has almost every upgrade available and if you are interested in the guitar, you no doubt have an idea of what it cost to have built. It plays like a dream and sounds like every other McNaught I have owned, played or heard - amazing. Most significant is that it is a McNaught you don't ever have to stress about playing live. It is a players guitar that is still beautiful and it can be had for far less than you could ever hope to find a Phoenix", "ItemID": "192750281051", "EndTime": "2018-12-12T02:32:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T02:32:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Davis-Thomas-McNaught-pheonix-guitar-/192750281051", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "North Hollywood, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927502810518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIwWDM1Mw==/z/hz0AAOSwAopcCdte/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIwWDQ4OA==/z/Vn0AAOSwnWpcCdtf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTg2WDYyMA==/z/A60AAOSwj-RcCdtg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "91606", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "massinfluence68", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 74, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1499.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***6", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 280}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Davis Thomas McNaught  pheonix guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["McNaught"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 107, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1524.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The bad: I bought this from my friend who was the original guitarist in Shinedown.
