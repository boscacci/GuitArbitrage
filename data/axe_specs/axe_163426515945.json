{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Greetings and welcome, waifs, strays, stragglers, vagabonds, bo ho's, buskers, tramps, vamps and pirates, yes especially pirates! So m'hearties this is a FIVE DAY ONLY auction, part of our Christmas sales from the stable of afterlife acoustics. For consideration, we have here a 'nice' forty eight year old Eko from late 60's or very early 70's with the nice sci-fi 'bubble' headstock logo. Now, this is a STRICTLY PLAYERS ONLY GUITAR!! an early edition of this classic Italian guitar, a somewhat well weathered wayfarer, and has been put through her paces for sure. Converted to a six string guitar (can easily be changed back to a 12 string) so it has the nice wide neck of a 12 stringer to suit those of use with larger hands, this plays very well and the pickup is good and punchy. This thing has travelled the world and then some, now it is your turn and she's going for a second time around on the carousel?! So lets talk turkey... \u221e Lots of lines, checks, scratches, dings, marks, cracks(in varnish not wood) on front, back and sides, so this is no corner of the room statuette! \u221e Otherwise in original structurally good condition with a pickup fitted \u221e Action good, set at low around 2.5mm @12th fret, can be raised or lowered with the original adjustable saddle \u221e Professionally set up and maintained \u221e UK Made nickel wound light gauge strings fitted \u221e Frets in good condition as is board \u221e Body took some flack over time, has a weathered part relic look with plenty of wear commensurate with a played guitar of age. Great mojo and good tone That is what it is about with these old loves, this has plenty of Jap mojo and that classic well dried tone, a players guitar. No reserve, low start pro setup, slinky Eko!!
