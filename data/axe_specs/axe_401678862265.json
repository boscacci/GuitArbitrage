In this auction we have a Epiphone Les Paul Traditional PRO Electric Guitar This Epiphone Les Paul Traditional PRO Electric Guitar is in great working condition and sounds great due to in store testing prior to listing.It is in great cosmetic shape with no apparent blemishes or scratches. Includes a Road Runner Black hard case.The case has very small minor blemishes. Epiphone?s long friendship with Les Paul dates back to 1940 when Les, working after-hours at the Epiphone factory on 14th Street in New York, created what may be the world?s first solid body electric guitar. Over the years, Les continued to work closely with Epiphone by reviewing new product ideas and offering suggestions. The Epiphone Les Paul Traditional PRO combines the best of Les? original design with new features--including newly tooled pickups--for a Les Paul that?s not only an incredible instrument, but is one of the best overall values available for guitarists today. We think the Les Paul Traditional PRO's combination of progressive electronics and classic styling makes it the very kind of guitar that Les would have made himself. After all, Les was a lifelong Epi fan and always encouraged us to never forget that the ?Les Paul? guitar was born at Epiphone.
