{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2017 Fender Custom Shop NAMM Limited 1964 Stratocaster Relic Ocean Turquoise Ove 2017 Fender Custom Shop NAMM Limited 1964 Stratocaster Relic Ocean Turquoise Over Gold w/ OHSC\u00a0 The classic look of a Stratocaster never gets old, and a decade after its introduction, the instrument was poised at the brink of history-making music in 1964. The Fender Custom Shop NAMM Limited Edition celebrates the 1964 Stratocaster by recreating the instrument in a special relic'd finish on a select alder body, hand-wound 1964 pickups, a 9.5 in.-radius fingerboard with 21 vintage-style frets, and vintage hardware.\u00a0 This is one of the coolest Custom Shop Strats we have had in some time. This guitar was $4000 new and it was only played sparingly by the original owner so it is in mint condition with no fretwear. The ocean turquoise over gold sparkle finish is incredible in person and because this one has a 9.5\" radius, it plays flawlessly up and down the neck (1963 C Carve). It has a set of Fender Custom Shop 1964 Handwound pickups which are perfectly balanced and articulate and it includes its original hardshell case, certificate of authenticity and all original paperwork.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ryan Fowler's Guitar Experience is one of Maryland's premier brick and mortar guitar shops.
