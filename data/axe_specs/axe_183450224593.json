{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Used 1984 - 85 Fender Stratocaster made in Japan. Sounds like the classic Stratocaster with clean bell-like tone and distorts out very well. even though the Stratocaster plays very well it is a used Stratocaster over 30 years old and does show signs of use. The frets show signs of use but are still very usable. The body has knicks scratches and a couple of bruises here and there and one major bump on the bottom. None of this affects playability. many years ago I have had a couple of Seymour Duncan pickups installed in the bridge and Middle . I am keeping those pickups and I have had the originals reinstalled. That is why the middle and Bridge pickup covers are still almost White as I had them stored up. The other neck pickup cover and knobs have yellowed over time. It's set up the way I like it and low action. You may need to set up to your liking. Sold as is with no returns.", "ItemID": "183450224593", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T22:15:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-23T18:12:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-1984-japan-/183450224593", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lebanon, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1834502245938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ubIAAOSwE8Vbp9Vm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~PIAAOSw~Qhbp9Vt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oVMAAOSwV-5bp9Vw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HdQAAOSwH~Rbp9Vz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/B6IAAOSwTJtbp9V2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/boIAAOSwMzVbp9V5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zdAAAOSwxaVbp9V7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rncAAOSw~IFbp9V-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MOYAAOSwAN1bp9WC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lFAAAOSwnFpbp9WE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QhoAAOSwtspbp9WH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37087", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jagdelay", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 834, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.8}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 445.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 445.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 374}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster 1984 japan", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["111800800", "310620532"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["111800800"]}]}, "HitCount": 1651, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78654738", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
