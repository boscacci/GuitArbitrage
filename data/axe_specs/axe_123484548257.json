{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A vintage 1965 Kay Speed Demon. Made in Chicago, USA. Three \"speedbump\" pickups. This guitar looks practically new. the sunburst finish is still shiny. The metal has no corrosion. The knobs are still shiny. Amazing. Near mint condition. This guitar is all original except that the bridge pickup was rewound. It sounds better than the other two now. It was rewound to original spec's and the guitar was re-assembled exactly as it was originally. The electronics sound great with no scratchiness in the pots. The 4-way switch has one position for each pickup, and a fourth for all three. The guitar plays great with good action and tone. One very minor thing I noticed is that the bridge slides on the body a little bit when you bend strings. A couple of small pieces of double-sided tape will keep it from sliding. the neck is 25.5 inch scale. Double-line Kluson Deluxe tuning pegs. The guitar weighs 7 pounds, 0 ounces. The case is the original two-tone white/black case. It's also very clean. I added two screws on each side of the storage compartment - the original staples had given out. Buyer pays $35 shipping. International shipping will be about $80-110. -Fred.", "ItemID": "123484548257", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T03:14:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T03:14:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1965-Kay-Speed-Demon-Guitar-Mint-Condition-clean-original-3-PU-w-case-NR-/123484548257", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "East Greenwich, Rhode Island", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234845482578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/3kcAAOSwQH5b6NPU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/HLYAAOSwzXJb6NPZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/6NEAAOSwTVlb6NQP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/lZgAAOSwoVZb6NPf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/YkQAAOSwZtRb6NPm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/nPAAAOSwDPNb6NPr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/MQEAAOSwcBZb6NPy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/N6cAAOSwhJFb6NP4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/XpwAAOSw7R9b6NP9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/BzYAAOSwWrxb6NQD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/zDUAAOSwNWtb6NQI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/hfEAAOSwHt1b6NQJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "02818", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kidkwik", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4782, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 488.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 488.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 101}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1965 Kay Speed Demon Guitar Mint Condition clean original 3-PU w/case NR", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Kay"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Original"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1965"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 387, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "SecondaryCategoryID": "118985", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118985", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=4149503", "StoreName": "the humble supergenius"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 493.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
