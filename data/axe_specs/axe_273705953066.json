{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I have too many guitars and time to scale down. This Epiphone Limited Edition Les Paul is HEAVY although not as heavy as a Gibson, but close! Excellent tone and sound. Guitar has very minor scratches and nicks. Case not included, but guitar stand is! Guitar will be wrapped and packed nicely in big ass box for safe shipping Product InformationOwning the Epiphone Les Paul Limited Edition Custom electric guitar puts you in the company of legendary Les Paul fans like Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend, and Matt Pike. The dual ProBucker pickups let you get that iconic humbucker crunch and sweet high gain tone, and the coil split option allows for sparkly, jangly single-coil tones as well. This guitar is also an eye-catching work of art with a fully bound rosewood fretboard, mother-of-pearl inlays, and a carved mahogany top. Your lead parts have all the sustain and tone you want because of the Epiphone's mahogany body, set-neck construction, and solid tune-o-matic bridge. Furthermore, grover tuners make sure that you never worry about going out of tune in the middle of a performance.Product IdentifiersBrandEpiphoneMPNENCTSBNH3UPC0711106329666ModelLimited Edition CustomeBay Product ID (ePID)78642123Product Key FeaturesBody MaterialMahoganyString Configuration6 StringBody TypeSolidAdditional Product FeaturesGuitar TypeElectricFingerboard/Fretboard MaterialRosewoodDexterityRight-HandedBody StyleLes PaulBridge PickupHumbuckerNumber of Strings6 StringAcoustic Guitar Type6-StringGuitar SeriesLes PaulSeriesLes PaulNeck PickupHumbuckerWidth AT Nut1.68in.Body ColorSilver BurstGuitar Scale24.75in.Neck MaterialMahogany", "ItemID": "273705953066", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T23:50:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-16T23:50:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Limited-Edition-Custom-Electric-Guitar-/273705953066", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pullman, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2737059530668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/Fm0AAOSw0VBcXzkK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/ZrYAAOSwL-9cXzlA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/2C8AAOSwKk5cXzl1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/uoEAAOSwAdhcXzmm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/VH4AAOSwpvRcXznR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/-DQAAOSwLgVcXzn~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjA=/z/elYAAOSwJgBcXzog/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "99163", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "neglectedeclectic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 64, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 228.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 228.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul Limited Edition Custom Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silverburst"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Limited Edition"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["ENCTSBNH3"]}]}, "HitCount": 723, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 231.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78642123", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 10, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent tone and sound.
