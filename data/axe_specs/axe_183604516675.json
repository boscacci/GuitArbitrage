{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a fantastic example of this model. The new owner will be hard pressed to find any real flaws. I cannot detect any dings, visually, and perhaps only a couple of very minor scratches if I run my finger over a couple of areas. The pickups do have a very few, very minor tarnish spots which is typical for older gold hardware. It has some checking on the back of the neck behind the nut area. It runs parallel to the neck. Similar checking where the neck attaches to the body. It is not readily visible - you have to be looking for it under the right light and angle. Never bothered me. This is not uncommon for these early 1980's korinas. My korina Flying V from the same era has the same thing going on. There is a sort of scrape(?) on the upper bout in front but again it is only apparent under the right lighting, angle and you have to be looking for it. I hate describing these things, but I must be honest. It is visually striking and if I didn't point these things out one might think it a new guitar. All original, to the best of my knowledge. I have not changed out anything while I have owned it. I have owned this guitar for about 25 years. I bought it from the original owner who worked in the music store that sold it to him new. I have never gigged or jammed with it. The frets are very good and neck is excellent. It inspires you to play. If you are reading this then you know what you are looking at. I have never disassembled any part of this guitar and I would prefer not to. But if a serious buyer insists on seeing something I will do it. About the pics: they were taken with an old camera phone and some appear a little blurry and dark. I apologize. But this Moderne looks as good as any of the others that I see for sale currently. Certainly korina Gibsons will only go up in value. It appears that Gibson will not make Korina guitars anymore. It seems they are afraid to touch it now after having been raided. I will sell this guitar in the next few days. I will lower the price as necessary until that happens so someone is going to get a steal. Don't be shy about making offers. All I can say is \"no, thanks\". If I weren't hurting for $$ it wouldn't be for sale. Sales only to the lower 48 states please. I understand this is a high-dollar guitar and I will ship it fully insured unless the buyer instructs otherwise. If the fully-insured shipping total is greater than what I have listed I am will to do a 2/3 1/3 sort of thing. For example if the actual shipping is $300 the buyer pays $200 and I will pay $100. Sound fair? I am willing to discuss it with the buyer. If you live outside the lower 48 and you want to buy/bid please CONTACT ME FIRST using the \"Ask a question\" button (e.g. shipping will be more and we should discuss that). This item is also listed locally so I reserve the right to end the auction at any time. Check my feedback and bid with confidence. I will treat you right.
