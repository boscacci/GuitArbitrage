{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your consideration is a pair of Korean Made Ibanez AX Series guitars from 1999. I purchased these over the summer in hopes of doing a couple restoration/mod projects, but with baby number 2 on the way in 4 months, projects are on hold. Both of these guitars are structurally in great condition. The necks are straight, show little to no fret wear and very clean for their age. Cosmetically, there is no deep damage, but the clear coat on both bodies shows quite a bit of surface scratches and hazing. From a distance, it\u2019s hard to tell, but up close, visible. These guitars would make a great mod project, or if the surface abrasions aren\u2019t an issue, just great guitars to get creative with and enjoy without worrying about being too careful. Due to the picture limits on eBay, I can send additional shots of each guitar if you have any concerns regarding condition. Price has been set accordingly to reflect condition. AX320T - Vampire KISS (Red) 1999 Mahogany Body, Maple Set Neck, Infinity Humbuckers, Lo-TRS Locking Tremolo (no whammy bar). At minimum, will need setup. Shipped to me with strings completely loose. AX120 - Black 1999 Mahogany Body, Maple Bolt On Neck, AH Humbuckers, Fixed Bridge, String-Thru Body Guitars will be shipped with new Fender Deluxe Gig Bags Technical Information: All sales are final and returns are not accepted. Instruments are used and sold As-Is. Payment is expected via PayPal within 24 hours of auction closing. USPS Priority Shipping is $59.00 to anywhere in the USA. Due to the fact that both of these guitars have Rosewood Fretboards, I am unable to ship internationally due to CITES regulations. I apologize to International bidders for the inconvenience. If there are any questions or concerns, please let me know. Thanks for looking and have a great weekend.", "ItemID": "123646972486", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T06:45:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T06:45:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-AX120-AX320T-Electric-Guitar-Lot-Korea-1999-John5-Marilyn-Manson-Zombie-/123646972486", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Warren, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover", "AmEx"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236469724868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bWEAAOSwSCZcZlhp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZWYAAOSwPaBcZlhz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BmoAAOSwW0tcZlhj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oEcAAOSwwmBcZlht/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AMYAAOSwVZ1cZlkM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ggoAAOSwKmhcZlkR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oOQAAOSwkNFcZlhm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qLoAAOSwWKpcZlhh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/slMAAOSwg~9cZlh1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yJUAAOSwm1VcZlkU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JGoAAOSwAvFcZlkW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mAIAAOSwHSVcZlkY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48088", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ectoshock", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 567, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 18}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez AX120 AX320T Electric Guitar Lot - Korea 1999 John5 Marilyn Manson Zombie", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}, {"Name": "To Fit", "Value": ["Electric Guitar"]}]}, "HitCount": 173, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 202.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
