{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "GRECO EG-600 G 1991 Goldtop MIJ fujigen Serial #: 1 5402 Wow! Check out this early 90's Greco EG-600 G! Goldtop finish w/1ply cream pickguard. MADE IN JAPAN. 1991 Fujigen manufacture. Mahogany body w/maple top, mahogany neck, and factory stock on the model Screamin' front and rear humbuckers! It is a used instrument and it has been played of course so it does have a few small marks on it here and there nothing that I found that I would call significantly major and overall I'd say that it's fine shape! Bit of camera flash glare and light reflection in the photos. White glare areas on the neck, body, and headstock are only camera flash and light reflection. The neck is straight and in solid condition. Frets and fretboard fine. Metal parts, hardware, and pickups are in solid working condition as well. Gave it a few good runs and it sounds great! Big beefy tone and plenty of power with the Screamin humbuckers! Plays great! If this is what you're looking for don't miss it! Comes w/generic hardcase in fine shape.
