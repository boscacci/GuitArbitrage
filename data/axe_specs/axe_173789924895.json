Bidders with less than 5 feedbacks, and/or multiple bid retractions,must contactme before bidding. I reserve the right to cancel bids from bidders with a sketchy bidding history. If you have questions, please ask before bidding! You are checking out an early 60's Gibson Melody Maker in need of some work. A great fixer upper project. Neck pickup works, bottom bridge does not, may be a wiring issue or the bottom pickup may need to be re wound. Bridge pickup is missing all but 1 screw that is the only thing holding it in place. Tailpiece is missing. Comes with the Schecter tuners shown. What you see is what you get, I do not have any parts or extra anything, so there you go! Cosmetically it is in fair vintage condition for a guitar from the late 50's It has its share of battle wounds from over the years for sure. There is some peeling here and there and the clear coat is cracking on the better part of the body. Please see pics and judge for yourself! This is sold as is. Auction includes the early 60's Gibson Melody Maker with case shown and as pictured and described only. I highly recommend using Uship for Very delicate heavy or bulky items. They come to me pick it up and deliver it to you safely. You must go to their website and setup an account, (it takes 5 minutes) and make the arrangements yourself. I have had great dealings with this service, but in no way am I responsible for damage during their handling. It is located in West Ft Lauderdale area. Just give them your location and approximate dimensions, for example, \"Drum set with hardware\" they take bids with drivers passing my area to yours, or you can set a price you are willing to spend for the transaction, It works and its easy! Costs less than UPS or Fedex for heavy or bulky items! I use a great deal of packing material to make sure everything arrives safely and this will be shipped in a strong box. . Please keep that in mind when calculating your shipping . Check out my feedback regarding packing! Yes my shipping may be more money then the other guys....but isn't spending a couple of bucks more, better than getting your merchandise damaged? My handling fee covers extra packing material, and or my time to find the best box for your item! FYI, If you pay fast I ship fast! International bidders are responsible for duties.
