{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For your consideration is a Peavey Wolfgang USA model in ivory white with black binding. The guitar is in excellent shape with little to no fretware and has been professionally setup with Elixer 10 ga. strings. Plays great and sounds killer. There are no scratches, buckle rash or fingernail / pick marks as it has not been gigged and stayed in my smoke free, pet free home. Its completely stock other than I had the toggle switch wired to a normal bridge down, middle both, up neck, pickup selection. They come wired backwards and I just didn't care for it. If you want it different its an easy 2 minute change. I did capture two very minor blemishes and they are VERY minor. The hardware is near perfect with no tarnishing, pitting or rust marks. The bottom 2 rests on the case are not intact and it came that way from the factory when I purchased the guitar new.....it doesn't affect the functionality of the case in anyway, so I just didn't make an issue out of it as I was so pleased with the guitar. The Ivory color USA models don't come up for sale vary often so hears your chance to snag a great one at an excellent price. Good luck and please feel free to ask questions. Thank you !!", "ItemID": "303009118724", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T09:58:28.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-26T16:02:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PEAVEY-WOLFGANG-USA-/303009118724", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Brandon, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030091187248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/meIAAOSwF7lcI6BZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/8gMAAOSwcH5cI6Bt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/R-UAAOSw1jpcI6B-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/CB8AAOSwM6FcI6CL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/NtEAAOSw5qJcI6Cb/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/VT4AAOSw1IhcI6Co/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/tnEAAOSwzgtcI6C0/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33511", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rekrek", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 291, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PEAVEY WOLFGANG USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Wolfgang USA"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 116, "Subtitle": "EXCELLENT CONDITION", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "EXCELLENT", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
