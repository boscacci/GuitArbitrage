{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is my Ibanez Artcore AS 73 guitar. Here's the story on this one. (they all have stories don't they?) When I got this guitar 12 years ago it had suffered some damage. The neck was split behind the nut about to the 7th fret. It was still in one piece so, on the advice of a local guitar tech, I fixed it. You can see where the repair was made but you really can't feel it. It was also missing one pickup. Anyway, I repaired the neck and put new pickups in it. That was 12 years ago so it's safe to assume that the repair is solid. The action is nice and low. I have recorded with it, and played it on stage a few times but I really haven't used it much. It looks like it had very little use before I got it. Still a beautiful guitar and it plays very well. I don't remember what brand the pickups are but they sound great. I realize that the repaired neck does affect its value. So the opening bid is $175 with no Reserve and free shipping within the lower 48. For obvious reasons the guitar is sold as-is. Questions?
