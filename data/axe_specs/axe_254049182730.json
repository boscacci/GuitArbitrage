{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hi, and thanks for looking! This auction is for a vintage 1984 Hondo Formula I Series Randy Rhodes style V or \"Concorde\" as it is sometimes known. These seem to be fairly high quality, with set 22 fret necks and original grover tuners. This one has the translucent black finish. If you look real closely you can see wood grain underneath. It does have some scuffs and wear to the finish, you can see the marks from the strap and whatnot. Like any pointy guitar, the points have some wear and finish missing but other than that it is solid as a rock. This model has the dual humbuckers and vintage style trem. There is one volume knob and two tone knobs plus a pickup selector. One of the knobs is missing but its just one of those metal knurled style like you would find on a tele. The guitar plays fine and the action is ok, not too high. I am including a hard case from a Dean V which it fits in just fine. It's kinda hard to find the V cases! You just have a little more space on one side of the V... If you have any questions, just ask!This is a no reserve sale.", "ItemID": "254049182730", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T20:08:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T20:08:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1980s-Hondo-Formula-1-Series-H770TB-Rhodes-V-Concorde-HH-Case-/254049182730", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Radford, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540491827308080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9TUAAOSwNrZcK8Nh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bK0AAOSwHGJcK8Nn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aVgAAOSwEppcK8OV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PscAAOSw29JcK8Nv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5IwAAOSwa3lcK8Ow/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yWoAAOSwzcNcK8N2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gPQAAOSws6dcK8N5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UocAAOSwVYhcK8N9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "24141", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "newriveronlineauctions", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4100, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 122.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 122.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "w***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 121}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1980's Hondo Formula 1 Series H770TB Rhodes V Concorde HH with Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Hondo"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Laminate"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup", "With Case", "Vintage Tremelo"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1984"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Formula 1 Series"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 141, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=58439516", "StoreName": "New River Vintage"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good condition, made in 1984 by Samick in Korea.
