{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "0 0 1 75 432 Flowforth Productions 3 1 506 14.0 Normal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE This is an amazing deal for a neck-thu Electric Guitar in like new condition. Allen Eden 1987 hard-tail model. Beautiful Spalted Maple body with matching reverse headstock (with natural Maple offset) , Dark walnut center neck-thru section, Maple neck with slick Maple fretboard, matte Black tuners and bridge, and thin Purple translucent finish. Comes equipped with two Wilkinson humbucker pickups. 3-way switch, and Black vol/tone knobs. This is a really underrated guitar (sells for $419 on the manufacturer website) \u2013 plays and sounds great having had a recent luthier set up. Also comes with a new Gigbag. All the instruments I sell have had a full luthier's set-up, including fret polish (level and re-crowning where needed), filed fret ends, oiled fretboard, action (string height) adjustment, truss-rod correction(when necessary), tuner inspection (replacement where necessary), as well as a thorough check of internal issues like bracing. The guitar will arrive properly stringed, often with a new set of D'Addario XLs. I pack the items professionally then ship with full insurance. I've been working with instruments for 20 plus years so I am very thorough. Of course, things may change slightly in transit - or you may want to further adjust the set-up to suit your playing preferences - but you will receive a guitar with a better set up than those just drop-shipped from the factory.", "ItemID": "173816071883", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T17:48:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-28T17:05:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Allen-Eden-Purple-Spalted-Maple-Neck-thru-Electric-Guitar-w-Gigbag-/173816071883", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lafayette, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1738160718838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDMyMw==/z/azYAAOSw8zRcThFF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDQwOA==/z/6wEAAOSwAGFcThFG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDM1Mg==/z/62UAAOSwsDZcThFH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDQ0NQ==/z/DQkAAOSwOmBcThFI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzUyWDYwMA==/z/LtYAAOSw-hZcThFJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDMwMQ==/z/xBMAAOSw3JdcThFK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "80026", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "flowforth", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2508, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 329.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 329.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2914}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Allen Eden Purple Spalted Maple Neck-thru Electric Guitar w/Gigbag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Allen Eden"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["1987 Hardtail Purple"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["solid body"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Translucent Purple Spalted Maple"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany", "Spalted Maple"]}]}, "HitCount": 27, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great condition.
