{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Sweet 1990 Rickenbacker 360 12 String Guitar. Not a guitar guy, was a storage locker score from a music collector (check out some of the sweet 1st ed. Mono albums that I\u2019ll auction later this week). I am not a guitar experts so it has been to St. Paul Guitar Repair and checked out for existing issues as well as mechanically tested tested. All the internals/electronics etc... are in full working order. The identified issues are missing strings and a few (4 or 5) small \u2018weathering\u2019 cracks, tried to show them in pics but almost unnoticeable to the untrained eye. Essentially, they look like little cracks in the clear coat of lacquer or multi stage auto/bike paint. While you can find them when you look close, they are not unsightly And can\u2019t be seen from 2 feet out etc... and they assured me that these are common in Minnesota guitars which have been in and out of cold environments and they do not at all affect playing. Other than that, they said it could use a tuning etc... as it doesn\u2019t look played for a very long time but it\u2019s in \u2018great\u2019 overall condition and looks like it was not played much at all, generally. Was probably just a show off piece after it was autographed. Autographed pick guard by Roger McGuinn. This is NOT his signature model though, it is just autographed by him in marker. ONCE AGAIN AND IN BIG CAPITAL LETTERS!!! THIS IS NOT THE ROGER MCGUINN SIGNATURE MODEL THAT IS A $5K GUITAR. THIS IS A 360/12 THAT WAS SIGNED BY HIM. NOT NOT NOT THE ROGER MCGUINN SIGNATURE MODEL. NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT THE RMSIGMODEL DANGNABIT. Comes with original case (which is in so/so condition, it has some stainage on the outside) and the original Rickenbacker paperwork with serial number etc... Here\u2019s the deal with the shipping price. It\u2019s high, I know but I\u2019m not an expert guitar packer so I\u2019m sending it with FEDEX PACK AND SHIP. This is a program where they pack the item at FEDEX with their techniques/materials etc... I know it\u2019s more expensive but this way you will know that it is safe and secure to get to you. I don\u2019t wanna screw up something on such a nice item. It\u2019s an auction with NO RESERVE so factor the shipping into your bid.", "ItemID": "223217975909", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T02:24:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-05T02:24:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rickenbacker-360-12-Guitar-Red-Black-Autographed-Roger-McGuinn-Pickguard-1990-/223217975909", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232179759098080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5N1g4NzA=/z/524AAOSwG1Jb36OR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7LIAAOSwF8Fb36Oy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0f4AAOSw6dhb36Nu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RqMAAOSwd7Fb36P1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CKQAAOSwqnVb36N-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bH0AAOSwhX5b36Ob/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dMAAAOSwaepb36Ol/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rqIAAOSw2-pb36QM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YjkAAOSw-5tb36PF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kKcAAOSwQuZb36Nz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jvkAAOSwMjtb36OA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5N1g5MDY=/z/kpQAAOSwHhRb36PX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "55118", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "straystuff", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3135, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 41, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1626.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1626.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 117}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rickenbacker 360 12 Guitar Red Black Autographed Roger McGuinn Pickguard 1990", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Rickenbacker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["12 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["360/12"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Reg"]}]}, "HitCount": 831, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1285025560", "StoreName": "straystuff"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1651.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
