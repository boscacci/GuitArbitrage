{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1983 IBANEZ GB10This is an Ibanez GB10 George Benson Signature Guitar from 1983, made in Japan.The serial number for the guitar is G831543.The pick-guard appears to be the original pick-guard, and is in pristine condition. The guitar has been kept in a climate controlled environment.The guitar plays like a true master's instrument should, as it was carefully cared for by a collector before I acquired it a few months ago. The guitar appears to have one modification, someone installed a second strap button on the back of the neck, and appears to have replaced the strap button on the bottom of the body.What we believe to be the original strap button (for the bottom of the body) came with the Guitar at the time of purchase, and will be included with the guitar when it ships. The guitar would appear to be signed by George Benson himself, see photos. This is the classic Ibanez semi-hollow body, perfect for getting that rich full-bodied sound of many a jazz giant. Can only accept payment via PayPal. Buyer is responsible for shipping.", "ItemID": "323606967414", "EndTime": "2018-12-22T13:51:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T15:31:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-GB10-1983-/323606967414", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Plymouth, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236069674148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5MVg3NzM=/z/Q70AAOSwds9bylRu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc1WDEyNDI=/z/gBkAAOSwxHhbylSg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kcoAAOSw6dhbylR4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PKIAAOSwnCFbylSB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pq8AAOSwwvtbylSM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i30AAOSwHt1bylST/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o2wAAOSwXy1bylSy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x6oAAOSwGsJbylOv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNlg1NzU=/z/Vo0AAOSw~LBbylQL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IB4AAOSwDkBbylTg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "02360", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "charlevermett_0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 55, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 174}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez GB10 (1983)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["GB10"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["There appears to be an additional strap button installed directly on the back of the neck.
