Description *************************************************************************YAMAHA (Yamaha)s LES PAUL (LP / Les Paul) / SL 500 S !!!!! \u25cf The sound of the rear pickup is small. There is no problem with other electric systems, the neck is almost flat, the frets are slightly decreased so there is no problem in playing. Strings are reattached to new ones so you can use them immediately after arrival. There is a crack around the upper left of the escutcion of the front pickup. Something somewhat like cloudiness of painting has occurred somewhat around the top of the head. Although there are some other scratches etc., I think that it is in a state not bad, if it is second hand for aging. Since the thing in the image is all the exhibit, please confirm.************************************************************************* Payment We accept PayPal only.Please make a payment within 3 days after send my invoice.
