{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Very rare Fender Stratocaster JR. Made in Mexico. 2004 This is not a Squier Mini Strat. It is much better quality. These were made for only a couple of years, in the early 2000's. It is in great shape. There is a finish crack in neck pocket. A finish chip on the end of lower horn, and some cracks on the edge. Some wear on the frets, and some small dents on back of neck. Minor dust, dirty, handprints from normal useage. This is the first Fender JR, I have ever seen. I thought it was a fake until I did some research. I am showing a product description I got from MF/GC website when this was a new product in early 2000's.
