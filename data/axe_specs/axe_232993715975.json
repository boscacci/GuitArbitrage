{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1984-1987 St. Blues Workshop Bluesmaster IV Custom Honeyburst Finish Signed TK Tom Keckler HSS Kahler Tremolo Tailpiece Beautiful guitar with hardly any wear. I would classify this as being in excellent condition for a 34 year old guitar but I\u2019d rather grade conservatively as there are a few very light marks and signs of use. Guitar serial number is 04088 which appears to be a very early serial number. Neck pocket is signed \u201cTK\u201d and stamped: St. Blues Guitars 1492 Union Ave. Memphis, TN 38104 Bottom of neck is also handwritten \u201cST103\u201d. Guitar has HSS pickup layout with a pull tone knob coil tap / split humbucker feature. The guitar is also outfitted with a Kahler USA PAT. APP\u2019D FOR tremolo System. This guitar has a 5 way pickup selector switch. All electronics work. The lock down screws on the metal string guide do show some wear in the philips grooves. I messaged St. Blues Guitar Workshop with pictures of this guitar and then spoke with a representative who confirmed that these early guitars were initialed by the craftsman that worked on them. He confirmed that this guitar was indeed built by Tom Keckler as evidenced by the \u201cTK\u201d initials in the neck pocket. I asked about the serial number and the year it was produced and he said it was made sometime between 1984-1987. This is a very early Bluesmaster IV Custom built by the main man himself. This is a pre owned guitar that will show signs of wear commensurate of age. I am not the original owner of this guitar and do not know the past history of this guitar. Guitar may need additional setup and/or adjustments for personal preference. Guitar comes with gig bag. Please see all pics for more details. Shipping to lower 48 USA.
