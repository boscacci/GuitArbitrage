For the ultimate Mosrite and Fender Stratocaster enthusiasts: collectors, players and public displays. Sold as-is. Serious buyers only please. Pick up in LA. International buyers please inquire first before bidding. Thank you. ***********************************************************The description, including \"one-of-a-kind\", was taken directly from Mr. Dave Kyle's letter and Certificate of Authenticity. The original owner worked with Semie at the Mosrite factory. Being also a Stratocaster fan, he wanted to have something with the \"notch\" settings. By wiring three mini-toggle switches, he could also get the Telecaster front/rear combination or any pickup alone, making the tone possibilities even higher. The Moseley vibrato unit was missing the arm. Mr. Kyle had a Bigsby Hagstrom unit and transferred the handle from it to the Mosrite. Mr. Kyle also stated that Andy and Mark Moseley offered to buy this guitar, but he refused at that time (June 14, 1995). Mr. Kyle also has a story for most of the signatures that he received on this guitar.This guitar has a very interesting history including being recorded by an artist. \"Each signature was procured and witnessed by me.\" Semie signed this guitar as-is, Dave Kyle thought this guitar was special enough to lug around different venues for many years to get signatures on it and Andy and Mark Moseley (Semie's brother and nephew whom Dave worked for) wanted to own this guitar. This is a piece of American history. RIP Nokie Edwards, my first guitar hero!", "ItemID": "253457307905", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T00:47:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-02-28T07:23:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/MOSRITE-Custom-Electric-Guitar-USA-used-Strat-Semie-NAMM-Amigo-special-sale-RARE-/253457307905", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lakewood, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2534573079058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjI5/z/OBgAAOSwqfZabRB1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q5cAAOSwXzNabRB4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5K4AAOSwoFVabRB6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTg0WDE2MDA=/z/v~gAAOSw8vNabRB8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjM1WDE2MDA=/z/P08AAOSwKcVabRCK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAzMlgxNjAw/z/jPsAAOSwZ11abRCC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dy8AAOSwrslabRCM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IooAAOSwp-RabRDP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GQoAAOSwMfhabRCF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90713", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pfiintl", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 644, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 6288.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 6288.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 279}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "GB", "CN", "JP", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "MOSRITE Custom Electric Guitar USA used Strat Semie NAMM Amigo special sale RARE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Mosrite"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 1857, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Custom Made in USA", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
