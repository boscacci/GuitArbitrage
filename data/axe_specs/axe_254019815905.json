{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Handmade by Terry in 2013. If you\u2019ve ever wanted a great les Paul type guitar with a trem. This is it !!!!purchased from Oz at Austin Guitar House (Top of Line Store). At the time Oz mentioned to the original buyer that this was the best guitar he has had in his store. (It's that good)One piece korina body, Honduras Mahogany neck, Mann-Made two point trem, Peter Florance custom wound Voodoo pickups. The most beautiful rosewood board of any guitar I've ever owned.One of the coolest features on this guitar is Terry's Mini Q - dramatic passive tone controls that sound completely organic. The dual concentric knobs control the two separate filters...and each pickup has it's own set. The top knob is a low-pass, and on this guitar the filter is voiced for that \"vowel-like\" Mick Taylor-thru-an-Ampeg sort of tone. The bottom knob is a midrange contour, and there's a lot of fun to be had here! Turn them up to \"10\" and there's zero insertion loss.Comes with the original black pickguard and black pickup mounting rings and black trem tip. I like the way the guitar looked without the pickguard and with cream colored pickup mounting rings. I can easily switch it back to the original black if you'd like or include it with the guitar. Weight 9 lbs.Great Neck, beautiful rich tones and Terry's Amazing quality build.I have the original receipt which I can include which was for $7000.Feel free to ask any questions.", "ItemID": "254019815905", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T03:29:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T03:29:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-Terry-McInturff-Carolina-Guitar-Trem-/254019815905", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Sedona, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540198159058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BfEAAOSwt~1cDdtH/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sE4AAOSwD1pcDdtP/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TwcAAOSwHSdcDdtc/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2uQAAOSwHu5cDdwz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dbkAAOSwXItcDdvx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sv8AAOSw~rhcDduC/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7kwAAOSwxPpcDdxx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RLUAAOSwcOZcDdxP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AWAAAOSwyUFcDdub/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "86336", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gabrielheart", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 57, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 91}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rare Terry McInturff Carolina Guitar with Trem", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["McInturff Guitars"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Carolina"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Korina"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 116, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great near mint condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
