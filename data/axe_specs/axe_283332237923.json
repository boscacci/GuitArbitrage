{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 1959 Gibson ES-125 T with a second P-90 professionally installed. Serial number inside starts with \"S\"\u2014means made in 1959 Issues : Tiny chip on the nut between the G and D notch doesn't affect anything, just being picky. The new P-90's have the same output and sound as the originals-- GREAT! All parts are new replacements-- tuners, pro wiring, Gibson wire, orange drop caps, tortoise pickguard. This is not a toy, it's a tone monster! Original finish is clean overall, a few flaws, nothing major, the pickguard and area around it is probably the least attractive area (pic #7), check the pictures close. The neck is straight, fretboard has some minor gouging but the frets show little wear. Fresh pro set-up, she plays clean all the way down, action is about 1/16 inch at 12thfret, great tone and a pleasure to play. Comes in a great-fitting old Guild hard case that provides serious structural protection, particularly after the expert contribution of a ninja duck-tape mojo master. The 2018 Vintage Guitar Price Guide values the 1959 Gibson ES-125 TD in excellent condition at $2000-$2700. This one is priced to reflect its non-original condition, despite the fact that it\u2019s now good as new!
