{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Moderne style electric guitar - Glen Miller Version The Gibson Moderne is the missing link in the late 1950\u2019s Gibson \u201cModernistic Guitars\u201d series that failed spectacularly when released and then went on to define the look of so many electric guitars of the future. The Explorer and the Flying V were produced and sold in small numbers - until \u201crediscovered\u201d in the late 60\u2019s - but the \u201cModerne\u201d was never released back in the day. In that respect, their is no truly \u201coriginal\u201d Moderne, just the many homages to it\u2019s unique sweeping design including, of course, the Gibson and Epiphone \u201cre-releases\u201d starting in the 1980\u2019s. This guitar is one of the versions created by luthier Glen Miller of Wrona\u2019s House of Violins in upstate New York. The story goes that they had purchased old stock from the Gibson factory in Kalamazoo, MI and created a series of instruments with those authentic materials. This is one of those guitars. The Moderne is the kind of instrument one either loves or hates. Full disclosure - I love them. In fact, the only thing I never loved about the Moderne was the original headstock design, a large fanned out piece of wood usually referred to as the \u201cGumby\u201d headstock. Imagine my delight 10 years ago when I saw this very guitar sporting Mr. Miller\u2019s ingenious mash up that put the split V shaped headstock known as the \u201cFutura\u201d style on this Moderne. It\u2019s a look Gibson later included in a 2012 release so I imagine it\u2019s a popular one. Made of mahogany and fitted with Bill Lawrence humbuckers, this guitar features a substantial neck (I believe ebony - possibly dark rosewood) and is a dream to play. The details of the Moderne story are enough to write a book about and fortunately such a book has been written. Among other treats about this mysterious artifact of the history of the electric guitar, it also happens to include a short section on Glen Miller\u2019s creations and images of this very instrument. It didn\u2019t seem right to let someone have this guitar without a copy of the book so I\u2019m including one along with the original bill of sale. FYI - depending of the light, the guitar can photograph towards either brown or cherry. There are two issues to be mentioned. The case is more of a \u201cshipping\u201d case than a \u201cgigging\u201d case. It\u2019s a Gibson case and fits the Moderne\u2019s shape perfectly but the latches, while workable, are fragile. The other is the fact that one end of the gold plastic \u201cGibson\u201d logo on the headstock isn\u2019t fully adhered to the headstock. Meaning it should be secured at some point. I don\u2019t do things like that so I haven\u2019t touched it. Finally, I am leaving my Dunlop strap locks on the guitar and including the leather strap I used with it.", "ItemID": "332958329228", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T15:47:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-16T21:55:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Moderne-style-electric-guitar-Glen-Miller-Version-/332958329228", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "New York, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329583292288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4Nlg2ODE=/z/o8YAAOSwZNtcFsaB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUzOFg5NzU=/z/mKUAAOSwtKlcFsac/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n-AAAOSwqkRcFsap/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j8QAAOSwxoJcFsa2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H1sAAOSwVEFcFsbb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA4WDE1ODc=/z/eIMAAOSw5UFcFsbP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTA2WDE1ODc=/z/jfMAAOSwIAJcFsbv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjgzWDE1ODc=/z/M4AAAOSwWAhcFscF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6HwAAOSwFlJcFscQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NlgxMTEy/z/1dwAAOSw8iZcFsc3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ5OFgxMTc4/z/ZhIAAOSwmkBcFsdT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU0MlgxMDg1/z/SWEAAOSwhzhcFsd2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "10013", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cmartdgi", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 24}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Moderne style electric guitar- Glen Miller Version ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Mahagony"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Moderne style guitar- Glen Miller Version"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahagony"]}]}, "HitCount": 124, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
