{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "We have here my baby that never was. I fell in love with the finish (Juju they call it) on this guitar! I bought her as a back up to my '81 LP custom. That band broke up and she didn't fit with the new band. So I kept her thinking I'll jam her some day or use her in a video. Ahhh... such is life none of that ever happened. So here she is still every bit a beautiful as the day I bought her. No mods, no changes. I never even got a chance to set her up. I'm pretty sure the body is swamp ash with a rosewood fret board. Gibson says the pick ups are custom Alnico II's. The tone is solid LP! The only issue with this guitar is that it does not have the Juju snakeskin guitar case. I have the very cool black snakeskin case. I've been looking for the V version for a while now and these are hard to find. Especially one in this condition. The new ones look cool, but not as cool and this early 2000 LP. I'm a player and I've been doing the ebay thing for years. Ask any an all questions. I'll charge $40 for shipping. I'll refund the difference if needed. No returns unless something crazy happens and then let's talk about it!
