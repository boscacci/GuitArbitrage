{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1999 Plum purple Parker Fly. Love this guitar and did a lot of gigs with it. Very stable trustworthy guitar that never let me down. I have too many guitars and have taken to strats so I need to thin the herd. Has a few scratches. I am the only owner. Bought it from Guitar center in 2000 I think. It had been dropped and there was a small crack where the strap peg is. I had it professionally repaired and then did a little touch up on the paint myself so it looks like a scar near the float adjuster. There was never a problem with it. Everything works great. The LED light for the battery is missing but I never used it anyway. Battery lasts a long time. I would replace every 6 months regardless if it needed it because it was a gig guitar. Comes with a Parker hard shell case. I just played this guitar for 30 min before reposting. Everything works like a dream. All pick up selections work and Piezo is great. Action is set really low. Every fret is the same across the neck.", "ItemID": "283329935486", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T03:03:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T20:10:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Parker-Fly-Deluxe-Guitar-USA-1999-HSC-plum-purple-/283329935486", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Escondido, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833299354868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/IFwAAOSwwFNb~vYj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/yqIAAOSwoEFb~vYt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/E2IAAOSwXMxb~vYx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/66cAAOSwtgZb~vY5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/LlYAAOSwmXpb~vZC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/26QAAOSw5-hb~vZI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/MrcAAOSwEJ1b~vZS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/ZFEAAOSwF7lb~vZX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/3o4AAOSwb15b~vZh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/TkMAAOSwx-lb~vZp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/DXMAAOSwIbtb~vZ2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "92030", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jpentonguitar", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 169, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 470}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": " Parker Fly Deluxe Guitar USA 1999 With HSC plum/purple", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Parker Guitars"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Purple/ Plum"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Fly Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1999"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 38, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1125.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good condition Parker Fly.
