{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I have for sale a very nice Epiphone SG Special that has barely been used. One good ding on the bottom back edge, a tiny finish crack by the plug in, a couple of very light scuffs, very little scratching. Hard to find any wear on the frets...guitar is in excellent used condition, looks great. I have oiled the fretboard, tightened things up, tweaked the truss rod, adjusted the harmonics. The guitar rings nicely with loads of sustain. Very solid body weighing in at 7 pounds. It balances nicely and is comfortable with low action and a simple one volume one tone setup with 3 way switch. Electronics, knobs, switches work as they should. The wiring looks sturdy, the pickups sound great. This Epiphone is a bit unusual with no serial number evident, I\u2019m guessing it was from a period when they used stickers for serial numbers. Also the bridge is a Komax, which were used from time to time. The humbuckers are a bit unusual, adding to the mystery of when and where the guitar was produced. I\u2019m guessing this one is at least 15 years old and very well made. The covers, pickups, wiring, etc., showed no signs of having been previously removed....I\u2019m sure this piece is all original. As is typical with less expensive Epiphones, the tuning machines are the weak link. These are holding tune well since the guitar has not seen a lot of use. A person wanting to gig might consider a set of Grovers. This is a great SG that can play sweet or crank out the AC-DC. Check out my pictures carefully and ask questions you might have. I would be glad to send more pictures if needed. I try hard to describe accurately, and I play the guitars and tweak if needed before I sell them. Sale is intended to be final.", "ItemID": "183635553303", "EndTime": "2019-01-17T05:00:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T02:52:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EPIPHONE-SG-SPECIAL-VINTAGE-/183635553303", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bettendorf, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836355533038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Sv0AAOSwHDdcO-iT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3A8AAOSwvrJcO-jJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9-0AAOSw3-9cO-kA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~PsAAOSwltxcO-k~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bmwAAOSwzhFcO-l4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DT8AAOSwVoNcO-m-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r44AAOSwDgJcO-p7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IHQAAOSwAP9cO-rE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~2YAAOSw~TNcO-sU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jgsAAOSwdxFcO-tD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NjoAAOSw0ylcO-vD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UlkAAOSwf1xcO-wC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "52722", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mychildren5-2008", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2011, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 135.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 135.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 11}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EPIPHONE SG SPECIAL VINTAGE ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG Special"]}]}, "HitCount": 47, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=847815792", "StoreName": "Bargain Charlie&#39;s"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent..barely used", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
