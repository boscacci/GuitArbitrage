{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "It\u2019s hard to let this one go, but I\u2019m saving up for a LP Custom. This PRS dates to 1999. 22 frets, but I don\u2019t have the hang tag so can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s a Custom 22 or Standard 22. Nice metallic silver finish with a very fine sparkle to it. All original except for the strap pins, these were replaced with chrome Dunlop strap locks. This guitar has been played quite a bit but is in pretty good shape. There are 4 small dings in the clearcoat, one by the input jack, one on the upper side of the headstock near the low E tuner, one on the upper edge, and one on the lower horn. None go through to the wood. There is also some pitting on the bridge and pickup covers. Just set up with Ernie Ball 10\u2019s by Tone Tailors in Lititz, PA. Includes original case, which does have some nicks but no structural issues. Latches, locks, and handle fully functional. Auction also includes Silver sparkle leather strap with strap lock pins, truss rod wrench, tremolo bar, and case keys.

On Nov-20-18 at 04:17:54 PST, seller added the following information: EDIT: Was recently told that this is most likely a Standard 22 since there is no masked wood binding around the front edge. Did not verify this with PRS but wanted to share that info.On Nov-27-18 at 15:55:56 PST, seller added the following information: Confirmed with PRS that this is a 1999 Standard 22 in Platinum Metallic with mahogany body and neck, Indian rosewood fingerboard, dragon 2 pickups.
