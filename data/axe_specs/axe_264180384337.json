{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this Gibson Les Paul Classic \"1960\" in a beautiful tobacco burst finish. The guitar was made in the USA in 2001 and is all original. Overall, the guitar shows signs of wear, but it is in good working and playing condition. There are some small scratches and dings throughout the guitar and some of the plastic pieces have small cracks on them (back plate, pickguard, and output jack). In addition, there is some very light checking on the face of the guitar and some more prominent lacquer checking on the back of the guitar. This is somewhat common on vintage and reissue Gibson guitars that are finished with nitrocellulose. Some people hate the look while others pay a lot of money or intentionally try to relic their instrument to achieve similar lacquer checking. This one was not intentionally relic'd and happened from normal play wear over the years. The heavier checking is on the back of the guitar so it's not very noticeable when the guitar is in playing position. The guitar just had the frets polished and was restrung with 9 gauge strings. The guitar plays and sounds great and is ready to be enjoyed for years to come! This \"1960\" version of the Gibson Les Paul Classic has been discontinued and is becoming harder to find in this tobacco burst finish and with all original parts. The guitar comes with a fitted brown Gibson Les Paul hardshell case with pink interior.Please feel free to ask any questions or make an offer!", "ItemID": "264180384337", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T20:20:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-04T20:00:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2001-Gibson-Les-Paul-Classic-1960-Tobacco-Burst-Sunburst-Electric-Solid-Body-USA-/264180384337", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cathedral City, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641803843378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iasAAOSw7C5cWJls/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tjcAAOSwhY9cWJl~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VFIAAOSwdxFcWJmO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WhwAAOSwZupcWJmN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XIMAAOSwXTVcWJmM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LQ8AAOSwprtcWJmP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-UkAAOSwXFRcWJmP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ps0AAOSwPWtcWJmL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JSMAAOSwj9hcWJmP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uQ0AAOSwMkdcWJmQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LRwAAOSwjfBcWJmN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WfwAAOSwH-RcWJmf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mydeadblues", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 213, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2001 Gibson Les Paul Classic 1960 Tobacco Burst Sunburst Electric Solid Body USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Classic"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Classical"]}]}, "HitCount": 162, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
