{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for grabs is this sharp, sharp, SHARP looking 2011 Fender \"Telebration\" '62 Custom Telecaster, straight from the Fender USA factory in its double-bound Olympic White (nitrocellulose lacquer) glory! Sounds great with its Alder body, rosewood fingerboard on maple neck, and '62 Custom Telecaster pickups! The neck is a nice, slim 7.25\" radius \"C\" shape - or at least that's how it feels to my hand - with very cool block inlays. Looks like its wearing a 007 dinner jacket, lol!! You will notice one spot on the left front lower bout - about 3/4\" long but pretty skinny - where the lacquer has come off. Meant to put some coverage on it at some point but never got around to it; the lacquer peel came before my ownership. Comes with a NON-ORIGINAL tweed third party (i.e., not Fender) case. But hey - it's a case, and it'll keep your new reverse tuxedo baby happy! Will try to post additional pics and/or comments over the weekend. Happy to answer any questions. Please wait for a final invoice before PayPal payment so that I can include an accurate ship total. Shipping will be via FedEx, so please - no P.O. Boxes, no FPOs, and NO SHIPPING OUTSIDE U.S.A.
