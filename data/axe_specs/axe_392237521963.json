{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding beautiful burst on this 2006 Les Paul Custom Re-issue--the finish is nice all over with a little worming on the back that doesn't show up even with a flash--there are some reflections because the finish is still very shiny--on the whole the guitar is in excellent cosmetic condition with a few very small dents and some minor hazing on hardware as seen in the scans--it presents like a store demo from a few feet away even though it is 13 years old. the binding is clean--the guitar and the case smell good--the bridge pickup pot has been changed to a 1k but the original is in top working condition and is included--the previous original owner wanted more bite as it was explained to me-- These re-issues are not chambered and the guitar weighs in right about 10 pounds--the fretboard is excellenst and is ebony--the original frets are also excellent--i replaced the nut with a newly luthiered bone nut--the old one had been carved on very poorly and the new nut is flawless making string placement perfect. The case is a bit beat outside but clean inside--the original pot is in the case pocket the neck angle is perfect and the action is fast and does not fret out currently set at my preferences 3/32nds at the 12th fret e string--working truss rod--other than the new bone nut and the ik pot it is completely original and as mentioned the original pot is in the case pocket. thanks for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling and has been intonated as well as setup for my preferences-- the guitar may also be for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392237521963", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T20:14:55.000Z", "StartTime":
