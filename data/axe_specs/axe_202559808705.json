{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Another Beauty from the Collection of Rock-a-Billy Artist Billy Hancock! William C Hancock was an American singer, guitarist, bassist and multi-instrumental recording artist. He made many recordings, primarily in the rockabilly genre, but also a large body of recorded work in rock 'n' roll, blues, jazz, rhythm & blues, and country music. He performed live primarily in the Washington, DC are, but also played regularly at European and Scandinavian roots music festivals. Billy's musical genius spanned 50 years, as he played with everyone from his teenage group The Torquays, to Danny Gatton and the Fat Boys, The Tennessee Rockets, and many bands he fronted under his own name. Billy left this earthly stage on January 22, 2018. As the first anniversary of his death approaches, his bride and the love of his life has decided to offer a limited number of the guitars from his personal collection so others can make beautiful music and entertain fans with the instruments he loved. This offering will be carefully wrapped and packaged for secure shipment to its new home. All sales are AS IS and Final.
