{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Charvel USA Select SD1 Condition: This Charvel USA Select SD1 has been very gently used. It is in excellent condition, and shows little to no signs of wear. Includes original case. Serial number: 10330. Weight: 7.3 lbs. has stepped in to a to fill the growing trend for all things 80&rsquo;s with a modern playing, no nonsense, &ldquo;throw back&rdquo; workhorse. The Charvel San Dimas Style 1 HSS HT harkens back to the early DNA of Charvel, now built in the Corona factory in California, USA. The San Dimas Style 1 is a solid Alder body with 1980&rsquo;s styling (But not the hair styling!). It comes with a one-piece, quartersawn, maple neck with one-way vintage-style bullet truss rod, and a 22 jumbo fret, rosewood, compound radius fingerboard with rolled edges and a bone nut. The outstanding horse power comes from a set of well matched DiMarzio pickups in HSS configuration; A DP100 Super Distortion in the bridge and a pair of DP-116 HS2 single coils for the neck and middle positions. The 5 way &ldquo;super blade&rdquo; selector switch switches the bridge (Position 1), the bridge inner coil and middle (Position 2), bridge inner coil and neck (Position 3), neck and middle (Position 4) and the neck pickup only (Position 5). This brings you an interesting, and versatile range of tones. It delivers pure rock, just as you&rsquo;d expect, although if that&rsquo;s all you thought the San Dimas was capable of, you&rsquo;d be mistaken. Charvel doesn&rsquo;t complicate things any further by providing anything more than a simple volume knob for control, a side mounted output jack and a string through body, hard tail bridge. All the hardware is black and just looks stunning paired up with the satin polyurethane finish.
