{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great playing acoustic electric, but I recently got a Taylor so this one has been neglected and needs a good home. This is the EP9-RRB model, in what Ibanez calls the \u201cresonant root beer\u201d finish. Engelmann spruce top, African mahogany back, sides, and neck, and rosewood fretboard. High end appointments including \u201ctree of life\u201d fretboard inlay, wood inlays around soundhole, Fishman Aura on-board electronics with built-in tuner, and gold Grover tuners. All original, no modifications. Guitar is in great shape, with only one finish chip next to the soundhole due to overly aggressive strumming. Nice thin neck profile, plays great and sounds good both plugged and unplugged. Recently set up with 12\u2019s by Tone Tailors in Lititz, PA. Includes non-original TKL case in good shape with no structural issues. Auction also includes brown Levy\u2019s strap, paperwork, Allen wrench, spare bridge saddle, spare bridge pin, case key, and 2 sets of strings.
