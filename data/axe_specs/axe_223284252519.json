{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Note! The color is getting washed out by the lighting. It is the bright red factory color. It's the original paint. It is not pink or light red. Please read below for guitar description Up for sale is an all original series 1 Peavey Vandenberg. This is from my personel collection as I am a player not a dealer. Has orginal pickups, Kahler Floyd Rose, tuners etc. Guitar is a dream to play. Pickups are awesome with the bridge a hot 14.5 k. It has been played through the years as you can see from the photos but not abused. As expected with a played guitar, she has swirl marks and littlescratches and chips here or there. On the back there are a few bigger paint chips as you can see in photo. It is the orginal paint. Electronically shes perfect. Body is made of poplar. Very collectable guitar thats only going to continue to go up in value. Thanks for looking. PLEASE NOTE, the color is the original factory red. The flourcent lighting is making the guitar look faded or almost pink but it is indeed the original Peavey red. Thanks $50 shipping USA", "ItemID": "223284252519", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T22:46:54.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T14:04:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Peavey-Vandenberg-Electric-Guitar-Orgingal-Series-1-All-Orginal-Nice-Shape-/223284252519", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cranston, Rhode Island", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232842525198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SAsAAOSwn01cE7VB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1mQAAOSwX6RcE7Vr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GBAAAOSwg1JcE7Vo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZdYAAOSwmfhcE7Vp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vgsAAOSwwSJcE7Vp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Cv0AAOSwn6JcE7Vp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XHkAAOSwcH5cE7Vp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/U0YAAOSw-yJcE7Vp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3roAAOSwW~JcE7Vq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~gAAAOSwOVlcE7Vr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BTQAAOSwFURcE7Vr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "02920", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nemesis-guitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 19, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 169}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Peavey Vandenberg Electric Guitar, Orgingal Series 1, All Orginal Nice Shape!\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Peavey"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vandenberg"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Super Strat"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunfire Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 580, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
