{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Jackson Soloist SLATMGX3-6 Solidbody Electric GuitarHigh-performance design puts you in touch with your musicAn excellent set of EMG pickupsHigh-performance design puts you in touch with your musicOne of Jackson's mottos is \"Choose wisely. Play better.\" That's not just hype either. The fact is, a well made guitar, like a Soloist SLATMGX3-6, gives you a closer connection to your music. For instance, the Soloist SLATMGX3-6 features a compound radius fretboard, which is more rounded at the nut and flatter higher up the neck. This makes it easy to fret chords near the nut, while opening up the fretboard for soloing. The flatter higher frets also let you keep your action low, without bottoming out when you bend notes. And thanks to its neck-through-body design, the Soloist SLATMGX3-6 also gives you epic sustain.An excellent set of EMG pickupsGreat feel is only part of the equation. Jackson knows this better than just about any guitar maker. That's why they've equipped the Soloist SLATMGX3-6 with a set of classic EMG humbucking pickups. An EMG 85 pickup at the neck and a EMG 81 at the bridge give you well-balanced tone with tight bass, glassy mids and crunching highs.Jackson Soloist SLATMGX3-6 Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:A performance-built solidbody electric guitar made for metal and rockStreamlined Jackson Soloist body styleCompound radius fretboard lets you easily fret chords and pull off highly technical solosNeck-through-body design adds phenomenal sustainA pair of EMG humbucking pickups gives you a huge range of toneTHE GUITAR WILL BE SHIPPED WELL SECURED IN GUITAR CASE", "ItemID": "264201628397", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T20:24:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-17T20:12:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-Soloist-SLATHXMG3-6-Electric-Guitar-Active-EMGs-Pickups-Neck-Through-/264201628397", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "North Port, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2642016283978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDYyNQ==/z/Y3cAAOSwrhNcYyOW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTUyWDYxNA==/z/gR8AAOSwKmhcYyPi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTUyWDQ2OQ==/z/W4YAAOSw~jpcYyPL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDk2MA==/z/MpMAAOSwFpVcYyOl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDk2MA==/z/~jcAAOSwUnJcYyOo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTYwWDk2MA==/z/3MwAAOSwH4lcYyOq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "34286", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ku1123", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1017, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 440.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 440.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 628}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson Soloist SLATHXMG3-6 Electric Guitar Active EMG's Pickups Neck-Through", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 15, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Lightly Used", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
