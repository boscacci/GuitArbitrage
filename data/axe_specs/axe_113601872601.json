{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Greetings, I'll keep this very concise. The instrument has never had any work done except changing the crumbled tuners with newer (60's) keystone one. Everything is perfect otherwise. The guitar has never had anything done to it except for regular set ups from time to time. No neck resets, no fret replacements, no overspray or touch ups. It is all factory except for the tuners as I mentioned. The action is good and can be lowered even further more (there's plenty of room on the saddle) and the truss rod works perfectly. There's about 70% fret life left and the brazilian board shows no wear! The inlays are solid as the guitar itself and the neck joint is perfect. It will show wear for such a old piece but there are no cracks anywhere on it! The original case is worn but solid with missing rear latch only! No smells/odors except for that nice old guitar smell! I have blacklighted and examined guitar and I cant find a FON/serial but based on specs and conversations with the original owner and experts in the field I have concluded it is indeed 40's circa Thanks and ask any questions you might have! I will do my best to answer in timely fashion!
