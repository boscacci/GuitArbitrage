{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is this vintage 1978 Aria Pro II PE-450 electric guitar. This guitar is in great condition for it's age, showing only minor wear and a few scuffs and dings. The guitar features a very beautiful Tobacco Brown Sunburst finish. This guitar appears to be all original (maybe only pickups were changed) and plays and sounds great! Here\u2019s a little bit of history: So I still keep this guitar more than anything by collection and not by playing it, since I do not know how to play guitar. This guitar belonged to my father who rests in peace, H\u00e9ctor Mart\u00ednez \"El Borrado\", first master of the film \"EL TOPO\" by Alejandro Jodorowsky, was the favorite film of John Lennon who later sponsored \"La Monta\u00f1a Sagrada\" at the end of the 60's. My father was in the backstage of The Doors, the only time they went to Mexico City in the early 70's, when Jim Morrison had a long beard, and there is the anecdote that they lived together in that concert in \"El F\u00f3rum\". My father was a musician, he played the guitar, he had rock bands like: The Sleepers, The Diplomats, he played with Javier B\u00e1tiz, and more. I never learned to play guitar as I said before, just piano and percussion. The PE-450 was made of Maple body (later Mahogany) and birch bolt neck. This vintage Aria Pro plays like butter and looks absolutely stunning.
