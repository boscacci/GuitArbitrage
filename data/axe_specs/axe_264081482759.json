{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I am still trying to thin out my herd of stringed instruments. It\u2019s getting harder and harder since I am attached to all of them at this point. Mostly collector guitars. This one is a RARE Jay Turser JT EVH Axis JT-72 Wolfgang E Ball style EdVanH guitar. I believe they were discontinued around 2005. This is a rock guitar! The fast neck, hot open zebra pickups and licensed Floyd Rose dive bomb tailpiece and locking nut make it fun to shred on. The build is top early Chinese Turser on this one. I didn\u2019t see many come to market back in the day (it\u2019s over 15 years old). It has a book matched flame maple natural finish top and a maple neck. The only thing I did to this one, besides the usual set-up was to add black, solid brass bell knobs that really set it off. There are two tiny dings that need to be seen in the right light\u2026some mild swirling but from 2 feet away this guitar looks fresh from the factory. Never gigged out, this was a collector. I\u2019m selling because I have a real EVH designed Kramer dive bomber in my collection as well. This comes with a gig bag which it will ship in\u2026bubble wrapped and boxed. I will be listing about 20 guitars and basses, guitar parts and microphones in the next few months. I ship fast and currently own a 100% feedback rating as a buyer and seller on EBay (860+ transactions, a member since 2001).", "ItemID": "264081482759", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T01:43:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-10T01:43:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jay-Turser-JT-EVH-Axis-JT-72-Guitar-great-condition-RARE-/264081482759", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ogden, Utah", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640814827598080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/qfUAAOSwAQVb8fzZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/1pcAAOSwBkBb8fza/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/cj8AAOSwbX1b8fza/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/sMQAAOSwvhxb8fza/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQzWDkwMA==/z/4egAAOSw2-pb8fza/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/7RUAAOSwUMBb8fzZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDUxNA==/z/P-MAAOSwQuZb8fzZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDY0Mw==/z/7QEAAOSwsptb8fzZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "84404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "blindedbyreality", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 886, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 185.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 185.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 6}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jay Turser JT EVH Axis JT-72 Guitar great condition RARE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jay Turser"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Clear"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 172, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 187.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
