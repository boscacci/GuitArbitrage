{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2000 MIM Standard Strat. This Mexican made Wine Red Strat originally had a white pickguard and white pickup covers and white control knobs. The pickguard warped causing the pickups to rise to close to the strings. I replaced the pickguard and other parts with genuine Fender parts in Black. I will include the original parts with purchase. This guitar is in great shape for being almost 19 years old. All adjustment screws work and are not stripped. It has been professionally set up and plays great. It does have some strange wear on the first few frets. I don't think it was from play because the frets are in great shape. I think it was from someone putting a pick between the strings after playing causing the lacquer to chip away. It does have lacquer stress cracks at the neck joint that can be seen in photos, very common on strats. No tremolo, but one can be added. It is not stripped out. It also has discoloration on back of headstock caused by pick holder.
