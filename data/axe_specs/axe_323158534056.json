Taking design and visual cues from the Les Pauls of the \u201980s and \u201990s, the Les Paul Traditional starts with a Grade-A mahogany body and adds nine strategically placed traditional weight-relief holes for a beefy tone that maintains the resonance of modern Les Pauls, while losing a large portion of the weight. This is capped with a maple top, giving the Les Paul Traditional the look of the great Les Pauls that helped to bring rock back to the front of the stage in the mid \u201980s. Capping the Traditional with a maple top not only looks great, but it also brings out presence and definition to the tone. With the look of the great Les Paul Standards that helped to make rock king again, and every ounce of the tone thanks to legendary Gibson construction, classic tonewoods, and two genuine humbucking pickups, the Les Paul Traditional is the guitar to take your music center stage where it belongs.FEATURES:- Features Gibson's rounded 50's-Style neck profile- Avaiable in seven classic \u2019burst and plain top finishes- Gibson\u2019s renowned \u201957 Classic pickups supply vintage PAF humbucker crunch- Traditional weight-relieved mahogany body offers enhanced acoustics & resonance- TonePros Kluson vintage-style tuners offer world-class performance, classic look SPECIFICATIONS: Body Top : Maple Back : Mahogany Body Type : Traditional Weight Relief Adhesive : Franklin Titebond 50 Neck Species : Mahogany Profile50's Style Binding : Single-ply Cream Binding Truss Rod : Traditional Adjustable Joint Angle : 5\u00b0 (+/- 15 seconds) Adhesive : Franklin Titebond 50 Neck Fit Joint : Mortise & Tenon Adhesive : Franklin Titebond 50 Joint Angle Tolerance : +/- .005\" Fingerboard Species : Rosewood Frets : 22 Radius : 12\" Nut/E.O.B : 1.695\"/2.260\" Inlays : Figured Acrylic Trapezoids Nut Material : Corian Width : 1.695 Slots : Gibson PLEK System Headstock Logo : Mother of Pearl \"Gibson\" Logo with scripted \"Les Paul Model\" Truss Rod Cover : Black and White Antique Bell with \"Traditional\" engraving Tuners Model : Kluson-style Tone Pros with Green Tulip Buttons Plating : Chrome Tuning Ratio : 16:1 Bridge Type : Nashville Tune-O-Matic Material : Zamak Plating : Chrome Tailpiece Type : Stop Bar Material : Zamak Plating : Chrome Knobs : Gold Speed Knobs Pickguard : Cream Toggle Switch Washer : Cream with Gold Imprint Control Plate Cover : Black plastic Strap Buttons : Aluminum Pickups: - Neck Position : '57 Classic - Bridge Position : '57 Classic Plus Electronics Potentiometers : 2 Volume Controls, 2 Tone Controls Type : 300k Linear Volume, 500k Non-linear Tone Coil Wiring : Machine Wound Toggle Switch : Three-way Switchcraft with Creme Plastic Tip Output Jack : Traditional 1/4\" Finish : Chicago Blue Case : Gibson Hardshell Case Black Weight : 9.9 lbs / 4.4 kg All our items are fully verified by our pro technician and/or adjusted by our pro luthier before being very carefully packed by our pro service team here at the shop prior to shipment, buy with confidence! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Canadian customers must pay any applicable sales taxes.
