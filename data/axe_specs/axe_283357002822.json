{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Nice HSS Mexican strat for sale, great guitar I just have too many American Strats to justify keeping this one any longer. I\u2019ve owned lots of Mexican strats and this is one of my favorites. Has a pretty high gloss neck, which is why I liked it so much. A few dings and scratches, which you can see in the pictures. The pick guard has quite a bit of scratching, I guess the previous owner did a lot of strumming and hit the pickguard often, I feel like I sound pretty stupid mentioning that but Since the pick guard is black, the scratches show up more than on a white pickguard. The special edition sticker on the back of the headstock is starting to peel off. The chrome hardware has a little bit of corrosion on it, as you can see in the picture of the tuners. None of these things matter, I\u2019m just trying to mention every little detail that you could possibly care about lol. It plays well up and down the neck.", "ItemID": "283357002822", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T23:59:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T02:37:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Standard-Mexican-Stratocaster-MIM-Mexico-HSS-/283357002822", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bluffton, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833570028228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PB0AAOSwuvpcT7jE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MDEAAOSwJ1lcT7i~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PaMAAOSwl7dcT7jK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/US4AAOSwkjJcT7jB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dyEAAOSwmfhcT7jH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1SwAAOSwdgxcT7jJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/764AAOSwew9cT7jG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FoEAAOSwtvZcT7jD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "29910", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "herrininc", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 383, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 330.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 330.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Standard Mexican Stratocaster (MIM) (Mexico) (HSS)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster HSS"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 222, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
