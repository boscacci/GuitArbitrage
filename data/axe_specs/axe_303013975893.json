Hes known to impress the most discerning of metal fans with his steadfast, fleet-fingered technique, and his personally designed collection of Jackson signature Juggernaut instruments is sure to set any shredders tone ablaze. The Pro Juggernaut HT7FM features a 26.5-scale length, basswood body with a striking flame maple top, one-piece bolt-on maple speed neck with graphite reinforcement for rock-solid stability and wrap-around heel for comfort, 16 flat radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets, offset dot inlays, Luminlay side-dots, and heel-mounted truss rod adjustment wheel. Not willing to sacrifice tone, Mansoor spent considerable time working with Jackson to develop new, killer-sounding Jackson MM1 pickups, which can be shaped with a master volume and master tone control with push/pull select and five-way blade switch. Also features a Jackson HT7 string-through-body hardtail bridge, Jackson die-cast locking tuners, black hardware and Jackson 4x3 (4 over, 3 under) AT-1 headstock.
