{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2004 Gibson Explorer Pro Trans Black with ebony fret board with pearl inlays. Mahogany body, mahogany thin neck and maple flame top. Born on June 6 2004 S/N 546. Explorer Pro is the 3/4 version of the Explorer. Much lighter with thin neck so easier on small hands. 496R neck and 500T bridge humbuckers. This model has the large pearl inlays which was only available for a handful of years. Condition is overall very good. It has been played (not abused) and has the normal light scratches you would expect from being played. You have to get it in the right light to see them. The backside has some minor buckle rash and I have tried to capture it in a picture. I wanted to learn to play guitar but found out real quick I was better off sticking to a kit. A friend of mine, who is a professional guitarist who also relics and restores guitars, gave it a clean bill of health. I can't begin to do this guitar justice so I recommend doing a youtube search on \"Gibson Explorer Pro\" and check out robertspurling review of the 2005 version of a trans black just like this one. I think you will be impressed with what this baby can do and he provides a lot of back ground info on this model. Guitar comes with hardcase and is packaged as in the picture for shipment. Happy bidding on this unique and increasingly hard to find Gibson Explorer Pro.On Dec-31-18 at 18:01:38 PST, seller added the following information: Edit - added pic of blemish I hadn't noticed before on bottom of body in line with 3 way switch.", "ItemID": "132904934427", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T23:38:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T23:38:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2004-Gibson-Explorer-Pro-Trans-Black-/132904934427", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329049344278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/wIEAAOSwzThcKptz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/JYYAAOSweI1cKpuN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzc=/z/gbQAAOSwAP9cKpub/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzc=/z/ckQAAOSwLSZcKpuo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzc=/z/3wYAAOSwr7ZcKpu2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzc=/z/D4EAAOSwjolcKpvW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/YgcAAOSwEppcKpxG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/IJ0AAOSwlelcKpxr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/tgAAAOSwCwBcKpx2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/jr0AAOSwmepcKqj5/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc3WDE2MDA=/z/nI4AAOSwH1pcKslq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28278", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gnmojo", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 449, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 26, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1586.27, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1586.27, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 91}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2004 Gibson Explorer Pro Trans Black\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer Pro"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["3/4"]}]}, "HitCount": 879, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1611.27, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
