From The Web: Swift, deadly and affordable, Jackson\u00ae JS Series guitars take an epic leap forward, making it easier than ever to get classic Jackson tone, looks and playability without breaking the bank. The formidable Warrior\u2122 JS32 has a poplar body and a bolt-on maple speed neck with graphite reinforcement for rock-solid stability. Hosting 24 jumbo frets and pearloid sharkfin inlays, the 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius fully bound rosewood fingerboard creates the ideal playing surface for fat riffs and easy chording near the nut while gradually flattening in the upper registers for lightning-quick solos and wide bends without fear of fretting out. A pair of Jackson high-output humbucking pickups with ceramic magnets cranks out clear tone with plenty of girth, and can be shaped with a three-way toggle switch and single volume and tone controls. The Warrior JS32 also features a Jackson-branded Floyd Rose double-locking tremolo bridge and die-cast tuners.

The Jackson JS32 Warrior delivers! That's because Jackson hooked the JS32 Warrior up with a pair of their custom-built humbuckers. These high-output humbuckers give you plenty of punch and serious bite - just what you need for today's most aggressive guitar styles. Compound-radius fretboard delivers maximum playing comfort and performance The JS32 Warrior features a 12\"-16\" compound-radius fretboard for ultimate playability.

Double-locking tremolo bridge gives you serious performance and stability Are you the kind of guitarist who likes to really lay into those bends, grab the whammy bar, and waggle your axe around like a bull whip? Good thing you're looking at a Jackson! Even this humble JS32 Warrior features Jackson's epic build quality, which includes a double-locking tremolo that's so stable, you'll never have to worry about your intonation going out of whack.
