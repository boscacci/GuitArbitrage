{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are bidding on a Fender American Deluxe Telecaster electric guitar. Year of manufacture is 2007; color is Montego Black. One owner (me), and purchased around 2008. This is a really nice looking and great playing guitar. Noiseless pickups, smooth neck/fretboard, strap locks, and high quality USA made components all around have served me well for over a decade. I am a home studio musician who enjoys quality equipment. This guitar has never been on the road and has been quite pampered - stays in its case when not played. That said, expect a normal amount of ware and tear and a little bit of dust, though there is nothing in terms of obvious blemishes or damage I can locate. THE TOP OF THE PICKUP SELECTOR SWITCH IS LOOSE AND TENDS TO JUST SLIDE OFF (as seen in photo). This is strictly a cosmetic issue and is easily fixable. Guitar includes hard case and strap, DOES NOT INCLUDE STAND SEEN IN PHOTOS. I am not guitar tech-minded/skilled at all, but I can say this guitar has always stayed in tune well and has required no or minimal professional setup/adjustments when strings changed (currently strung with flatwounds). Thanks for your interest and be sure to check out my other auctions.", "ItemID": "332870355066", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T01:14:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-07T01:14:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Fender-American-Deluxe-Telecaster-Electric-Guitar-Montego-Black-/332870355066", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Douglas, Wyoming", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3328703550668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/VbwAAOSwuJRb4jYb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/SdoAAOSwuMRb4jYo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/8P4AAOSweZpb4jYy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/rMQAAOSwYUZb4jY-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/Gg0AAOSwAfVb4jZZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/nhEAAOSw0Btb4jZm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/UwcAAOSwNe9b4jZw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/6kgAAOSwiwZb4jaJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/eK0AAOSwPjhb4jaW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/h8kAAOSwjZlb4jaX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/XVYAAOSw76lb4jab/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "82633", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "catfoodcatfood", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 186, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 811.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 811.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 857}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Fender American Deluxe Telecaster Electric Guitar Montego Black", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["0119400709"]}]}, "HitCount": 639, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 821.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78656290", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
