{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "What a shame here. Up for sale is a high end Jack Gretz hand built guitar. The truss rod is broken at the nut and the back of the neck has a lengthwise crack from the truss rod being over tightened. The base of the neck heel has a hole drilled into it most likely from an attempt to remove the old rod. The fretboard is unharmed and the frets are in great shape. The neck joint is solid. As is, the neck has a forward bow. The quality on this guitar is insane. The quality of woods used is upper tier. Jack Gretz worked closely with Paul Reed Smith and you can see the influence on these limited run guitars. This was #19 built. The finish is nitro lacquer and has some cosmetic wear. Some electronics included. The original flame maple control cover and rosewood truss rod cover are included. Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "202525064592", "EndTime": "2018-12-20T02:58:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-04T15:47:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jack-Gretz-19-Honey-Amber-Flame-Top-Electric-Guitar-Project-PRS-/202525064592", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025250645928080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4mQAAOSwpYxcBeEG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s6gAAOSwVEFcBeEI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MkkAAOSwAFFcBeEF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lg8AAOSw-rxcBeEN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gsEAAOSwiJZcBeEQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EGgAAOSwydZcBeEV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yiEAAOSwl7dcBeEP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Z4IAAOSw5cZcBeEK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ts0AAOSwC~BcBeEU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6KYAAOSwyYRcBeEX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hhEAAOSw4sNcBeES/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6611, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 265.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 265.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 18}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jack Gretz #19 Honey Amber Flame Top Electric Guitar Project PRS", "HitCount": 600, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
