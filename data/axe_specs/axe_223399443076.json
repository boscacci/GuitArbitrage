{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2001 Fender Cyclone in Candy Apple Red. Great condition, except for one paint chip on the bottom near the jack (pictured) otherwise great shape for it's age. It's missing the back cover plate too. It includes a tremolo arm and a Fender deluxe gig bag, and will be packed carefully for shipping. When I got this guitar the knobs were seized and it was very dirty. So i disassembled it and gave it a good cleaning and waxed the body. I cleaned and checked all the parts as they went back on, then I installed new CTS pots, a new neutrik jack, and a new switchcraft 3-way switch. The Cyclone comes with a 270k resistor installed on the neck pickup side of the selector, so I replaced it with a better quality one. It has new strings and a setup as well. Long story short, I'm only selling this guitar because I have another one just like it and a nice strat, and I can't keep all 3.", "ItemID": "223399443076", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T03:01:18.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T01:57:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Cyclone-MIM-Electric-Guitar-candy-apple-red-/223399443076", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233994430768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cE8AAOSwf1xcCQmH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EG8AAOSwBZxb2ktA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HBMAAOSwqqJb2ks-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UzwAAOSw-yJb2ktC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aggAAOSwCVtb2k1X/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zAsAAOSwVYtb2k1a/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zA8AAOSw40Zb2k1Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rrEAAOSwypZb2kwH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uBkAAOSwcDdb2kwJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80923", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "isellrandomthingstoyou", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 207, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Cyclone MIM Electric Guitar candy apple red", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 51, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
