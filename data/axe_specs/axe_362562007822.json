{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "those looking may know but if not this is the REAL 1984 reissue guitar by Gibson back in 04-05. The runs after that were made with black hardware and knock off Floyds. Not sure if they had legit Schaller tuners but this one does. 84T humbucker by Gibson, absolutely brutal lead and fat mid-rangy rhythms. Turn the low friction pot down and cleans up better than my tele... This is a VERY rare guitar and even more rare paint with bullseye in red. I have 2 and absolutely my favorite neck of all time, true louisville slugger and EVH maple unfinished for ultimate feel if thats your thing. Hate to let this one go but I already custom painted my other. Not sure how much longer these babies will be around for decent price, but word has already got out that these era reissues are the real gems made in america by Gibson.
