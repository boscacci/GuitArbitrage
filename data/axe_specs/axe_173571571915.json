{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING EMSproviding a tracking number Description: Hello! this is a very rare guitar in excellent condition. on it there are insignificant little scratches. Scratch on the upper bridge is in the photo. there are still on the body, but they are so small that I can not photograph them. I'm not the first owner of this guitar, so I can not tell you whether the pickups were changing and whether the electronics inside were changing. At your request I can make an additional photo. the guitar is fully functional. all works without problems. no complaints about the game this tool is not. These guitars were released in a very small edition. They are very few in the whole world. sold only what you see in the photo. No soft and hard cases. There is no lever for Floyd Rose. Only the guitar itself. All customs fees of your country are paid by the buyer! NO REFUNDS !!!! Before you buy this tool you can ask me any question. I do not accept refunds. All offers are final. I do not ship this product to Africa. If you have a low rating, then I can refuse to sell you.
