{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Kramer electric guitar. Nice sunburst finish, reverse headstock, 24 frets. This guitar has a Bill Lawrence humbucker in the bridge position, and a Dimarzio Air Norton in the neck position. The tone knob also serves as a push-pull, coil tap. Guitar is sold as is, and could use some setting up. Full disclosure here, this guitar is a culmination of parts I purchased for other guitar projects. All parts were purchased separately and assembled. The guitar is in decent shape (see pics, there are small dents and scratches from normal usage) and I have had fun playing it, but before bidding please know that i literally pieced this guitar together. That being said, I am starting the bidding low with no reserve. This is not a high-quality, boutique instrument. It would be a great guitar for a beginner, or for someone who needs a backup guitar or a beater. I will also include a soft case. Please contact me with any and all questions and/or concerns BEFORE placing a bid.", "ItemID": "163347109917", "EndTime": "2018-11-07T16:10:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-31T16:10:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/KRAMER-Electric-Guitar-Sunburst-Soft-Case-6-String-Right-Handed-/163347109917", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Sturbridge, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633471099178080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GccAAOSwTbNb2dI3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tMYAAOSwQqZb2dI5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3PIAAOSwFZZb2dI7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-zoAAOSwfhlb2dI9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zMAAAOSwCK1b2dI-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1H8AAOSwMjpb2dJA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/E50AAOSwAPtb2dJC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zGUAAOSw3npb2dJE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/54sAAOSwVXRb2dJG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LawAAOSwnfRb2dJH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01566", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "caseman0929", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 158, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 18, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 151.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 151.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 8909}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "KRAMER  Electric Guitar Sunburst with Soft Case 6 String Right Handed", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["kramer"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["Please Read Description"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 528, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 154.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
