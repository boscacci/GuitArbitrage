{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I am selling this Gibson Les Paul Supreme from a collection of guitars a friend of mine has. It has had very little play. It comes with the original hard case and all the paperwork it originally came with. It has sat in its case for most of it life. It will undoubtedly need new strings as they have been on the guitar since the day it was purchased in 2009. It is a 2008 issue top of the line with the Cherry Sunburst finish in mint condition. There are no nicks, scratches, separations or anything else to detract from the beauty of the finish. Fingerboard and headstock \"Supreme Banner\" in deluxe mother-of-pearl inlays. Gold hardware and tinted frets along with a pair of Gibson's most popular humbucking pickups. Item is warranted to be received as described. Shipping to lower 48 only. No international orders accepted. Local pick up is an option. We are located only 1 1/2 hour from NYC or Albany, NY. Also within 1 1/2 hours of Danbury, New Haven and Hartford, CT.. Buyer is responsible for shipping cost", "ItemID": "183579182990", "EndTime": "2018-12-28T16:15:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-11T00:24:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Beautiful-Gibson-Les-Paul-SUPREME-Heritage-Cherry-Sunburst-Original-Hard-Case-/183579182990", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Amenia, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835791829908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VoIAAOSwjfdcDvwe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Em8AAOSwBPRcDvwh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PF0AAOSwUMBcDvwk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CsMAAOSwUqVcDvwn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tUYAAOSwAopcDvwp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hRQAAOSwkHxcDvws/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4T8AAOSwHglcDvwv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zDsAAOSw4bhcDvwx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/80wAAOSwqlxcDvw1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5JYAAOSwcOZcDvw4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TFYAAOSwFlJcDvw6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/M5gAAOSwmaJcDvw9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "12501", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "845quartz", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 528, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Beautiful Gibson Les Paul SUPREME, Heritage Cherry Sunburst, Original Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Supreme"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 362, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
