{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "First off, let me be clear that this is NOT!!!! a real vintage 59 Big G guitar.It is a version made in china.Due to my age and bad health, I am selling my guitar collection.I bought this guitar new three years ago, and have used it about 6 times in the studio.It is in very good condition and has been well maintained.This is a solid body guitar with no chambers. I switched out the original soap bar pickups as soon as it arrived to a set I had that I knew sounded good.The only issue is that when I got it, there was a hairline crack in the finish on the back of the neck near the body.After very close investigation, it was determined by my luthier, that the crack was in the finish only and did not go into the wood.Three years later it has never gotten any bigger, there has been no change in the neck.This guitar plays well, low action, no fret wear, and nice sound.This guitar was ordered with the ebony fret board. I am selling the guitar at this price due to that crack in the finish.Sold as is, and there is no case. Please look at the pictures and ask any questions.", "ItemID": "254110631984", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T20:34:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-05T16:38:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-1959s-Gold-Top-LP-Electric-Guitar-P90-Pickups-Nature-Back-Side-Good-Quality-/254110631984", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Freeport, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2541106319848080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NK4AAOSwcXhcWbgg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jxcAAOSwAhtcWbgN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5Y4AAOSwZ2tcWbg1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3gAAAOSworNcWbhr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KYQAAOSw~2VcWbh4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JVIAAOSwBAZcWbiP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/04oAAOSw3-9cWbik/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mIkAAOSw0xtcWbi5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "61032", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ranger69black", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1051, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 185.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 185.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G-1959's Gold Top LP Electric Guitar P90 Pickups Nature Back&Side Good Quality", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["LS"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ZC-LP21"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}]}, "HitCount": 85, "Subtitle": "Used but in good condition", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar is three years old and the pick guard shows scratches from being played.
