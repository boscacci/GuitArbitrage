{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "96 800x600 Normal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE Up for auction is a Epiphone \"Music Rising\" 6-String Electric Guitar Here is a Les Paul Standard Epiphone Limited Edition \"Music Rising\" Electric Guitar w/ Matching Gig Bag. This is equipped with GROVER Tuning Pegs / Keys. It appears to be in Very Good Condition and shows very minimal signs of use and/or age. There are no signs of damage, misuse or poor storage. We did have this \u201ctested\u201d by a professional musician and he states that this plays very well. He was able to point out one potential \u201cissue\u201d and that deals with the Rhythm Treble Switch. He noticed right away that it does not remain in either the Rhythm position or the Treble position but instead moves back to \u201ccenter\u201d. There is absolutely no visible damage to the switch and it was suggested that it may very well have been made that way but if not, they are a few dollars to replace. Again, there is absolutely no sign this Guitar has been damaged, dropped, etc. however he thought it was important to point out the \u201cSwitch\u201d. This comes with the Original Epiphone documentation (see photo). This is being offered As Is (music stand not included). Please let us know if you have any questions or need additional pictures.
