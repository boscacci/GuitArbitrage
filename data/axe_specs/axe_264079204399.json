The new instrument would be shallower in depth to make it easier to hold, have wider spaced pickups to facilitate finger-style play, and have a lighter weight body block to add sustain and curb feedback. A handily placed master volume knob, classic Bigsby, and generous 1 3/4\" neck all ensured that the player had everything right at the fingertips. The result was the Gibson Chet Atkins Country Gentleman.This striking guitar has been maintained in outstanding condition, with 100% original gleaming cherry finish, without pick, buckle, thumb or fingerboard wear. All original gold hardware is in place, including Gibson's exclusive Schaller 'Crank Winder' tuners, each with a small lever that folds out from the tuning key to increase turning leverage, greatly increasing the speed of re-stringing. (Also found on Les Pauls of the era, these ingenious winders have been collector's items since they were discontinued in the late 80's.) The neck has a gentle shallow D neck profile specified by Chet, and flawless action over excellent original medium jumbo frets.Distinctive 'thumbprint' fingerboard inlays are a signature touch of Atkin's design, echoing his classic Gretsch guitars of the late 50's. Sought after by players of all types since the model was discontinued in 2000, the Gibson Chet Atkins Country Gentleman is a versatile and eye-catching tribute to the Man With the Golden Thumb.Original deluxe Gibson arched plush lined hardshell case.Serial: 83428570Built in: 07 December 1988 (serial: 570) (Manufactured in Nashville or Memphis) Shipping to USA or Canada is $80. $550 to Europe.
