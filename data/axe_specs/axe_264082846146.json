The 24.5\" scale length will feel immediately familiar in the hands of any fans of older carved-top single-cutaway electric guitars. The scale also offers a slinkier string feel across the fretboard for easier string bending and lighter string tension when chording. This looser string feel also gives you a warmer tone with a fat, singing quality.A great looking guitarThe SE 245 Soapbar is sleek and beautiful. The beveled top of the guitar is not only comfortable to play, but it adds a high-class visual statement to the instrument. Maple binding surrounds the body of the SE 245 Soapbar, offsetting the finish with an organic-looking outline. And the trademark Paul Reed Smith bird inlays are on full display across the length of the 22-fret fingerboard. Sweetwater players agree that these guitars look and play like much more expensive instruments.Two Lollar P-90 Soapbars provide tonal flexibilityP-90 pickups are one of the most versatile single coil pickups made. Jason designed ours not only to sound great but has always built them with materials designed to not deteriorate or become brittle over time. We cut and build our bobbins here in the shop along with all of our other single coil pickups.All of our P-90s are vintage inspired. They're also one of our most popular pickups \u2014 and for good reason; we focus on sound, consistency, and reliability. Also, you're not limited by your guitar since you can get our distinct P-90 sound in a soapbar, dog ear, humbucker, or Jazzmaster route.
