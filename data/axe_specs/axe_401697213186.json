{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Charvel Model 6 Neck-Thru Japan Made MIJ with Original Chainsaw Hard Shell Case Plays and sounds awesome. '80's shredder!! Shows some signs of use and wear with a few scratches and light dings, but nothing major. One of the six small floyd rose square blocks has been replaced with the newer styled smaller ones and works great. Comes with the Original Whammy bar. 2 volume/tone pots were changed out at some point and new wiring was added. The boost circuit, that was removed, was in the case. Please see the last photo. I will ship it in the guitar case along with it. Pickups are original and everything else is. Case is in excellent Condition and please see all the photos that shows the condition of this beautiful beast.", "ItemID": "401697213186", "EndTime": "2019-01-31T17:48:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T02:01:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Charvel-Model-6-Neck-Thru-Japan-Made-MIJ-Original-Chainsaw-Hard-Shell-Case-/401697213186", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Smith, Arkansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/4016972131868080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Ad8AAOSw-yJcPo2M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMwMVgxNjAw/z/tRsAAOSw7D1cPo2S/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwNlgxNjAw/z/3QkAAOSwzgtcPo2Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM2NVgxNjAw/z/neMAAOSw8bpcPo2g/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM5NFgxNjAw/z/yZoAAOSw9ptcPo2p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/7H8AAOSwcf9cPo2w/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/wjkAAOSwNphcPo20/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/zisAAOSwPDlcPo26/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Ai4AAOSwviBcPo29/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/nioAAOSwoANcPo3D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/drIAAOSwg1JcPo3G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTE2WDE0ODg=/z/tcUAAOSw66JcUQpk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "72903", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "musiciansguitaroutletonline", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 4571, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 64}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Charvel Model 6 Neck-Thru Japan Made MIJ with Original Chainsaw Hard Shell Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Pearl White"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Model 6"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1987"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 134, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=19967720", "StoreName": "Musicians Guitar Outlet"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Asia", "Middle East", "Southeast Asia", "RU"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Plays and sounds awesome.
