{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender AVRI '52 Telecaster. Rare factory natural finish. The natural finish has a slight butterscotch tinge, but it is natural, not the usual Tele blonde. Serial number 50621 (just like an original pre-1954 Tele, the serial number is on the BRIDGE on these reissues). Ash body. Made in U.S.A. This guitar was formerly owned by a Fender sales rep who hand-picked it from the Corona, California factory and kept it for many years. It's not just a story, I know the guy and bought the Tele directly from him. This is NOT a Japanese-made guitar, it's an U.S. made AVRI produced in natural finish for export for Yamano, the Japanese distributor for Fender and Gibson guitars in Japan. There are a number of these for sale on eBay in Japan. Here's another one: (for considerably more $!) Why is this one in America? As I said, it was hand-picked by a Fender sales rep for his personal use and was never exported. https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-USA-American-Vintage-52-Telecaster-Thin-Laquer-Natural-Electric-Guitar/233085985616?epid=2262320125&hash=item364501e350:g:rxQAAOSw9~RcDO5t:rk:6:pf:0 He had Fender Noiseless pickups and the optional \"modern\" wiring and capacitor that's supplied with these guitars professionally installed...the wiring is so neat that it looks factory! Has Schaller strap lock strap buttons installed, the parts that attach to the strap are also included.Very good condition, body has some lacquer checking. There are a few lacquer cracks, one on the upper shoulder coming from a pickguard screw hole and on the back coming from a neck screw hole (can be seen in pics). Some minor scratches and a few tiny dings. Looks great for a nearly fourteen year old guitar! No fret wear, frets have their full height. Straight neck, low action. Perfect set up, plays fantastic! Electronics work fine. Includes all the case candy, (no strap) papers and docs, as well as the modern 6-saddle bridge and \"ashtray\" cover, Fender polish and polishing cloth, a vintage style gray cable, and the of course, the original tweed case. Somewhat full, rounded neck profile. Not a huge neck, though. The fretboard radius is 7.25\". Neck is 1 5/8\" wide at the nut. Weighs 8.56 pounds on my digital scale...it's no featherweight. Includes all the case candy, (no strap) papers and docs, as well as the modern 6-saddle bridge and \"ashtray\" cover, Fender polish and polishing cloth, a vintage style gray cable, and the of course, the original tweed case.
