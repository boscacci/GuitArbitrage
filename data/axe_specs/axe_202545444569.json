{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Be sure to blow up the pics to get a good look at everything, and read the description carefully. Thanks for looking! 2011 Fender Custom Shop Time Machine 1959 Esquire, in Candy Apple Red, modded with neck pickup and three way switch. The back of the neck was stripped and finished with oil. Everything else is stock. Top-loader bridge. See pics for dings, etc. This is not a relic model, so everything you see in the pics is from playwear. Very little fretwear. The mods were done by a previous owner, so I don't know what the neck pickup is, but the sound is extremely well-balanced with the bridge pickup. Includes original hard case, case candy, COA, etc, as shown in pics.
