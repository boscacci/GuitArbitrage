TIPS TO AVOID RESTOCKING FEES ON NEW ITEMS When you receive an item, open the package using a box cutter and be mindful not to tear up or throw away the box or any internal packaging.\u00a0 Without having to curb your enthusiasm of basking in the glow of your new piece of gear, think in terms of preserving it in its mint condition until certain you are keeping it. For instance, if it were rack gear, we would recommend avoiding racking it until you were certain it was a \"keeper\". Thus preventing any possible \"rack rash\" or scratches. If it were a guitar pedal, avoid sticking Velcro on it and mounting to your pedal board until it passed your test to be knighted and sit at your round table of pedals. Although tempting to have both of your favorite things together, put down the chicken wings slathered in barbecue sauce that is dripping all over your leather vest and beard and be sure your hands are clean and dry before trying out your awesome new gear. Pet odors, cigarette and other smoke items can also affect the \"newness\" of your gear. Also, keep the gear away from your friend with the Billy Ray Cyrus mullet driving the Camaro. He's a good guy and he means well, but years of smoke tar and beer bongs have dulled his perceptions. Observation and application of these tips will help you avoid any restocking fees on new item returns! USED ITEMS RETURN POLICY In the rare case that you receive an item that is not operating as described in the listing, you are welcome to return it for a full refund, store credit or exchange for a used item of equivalent value within 30 days of your receipt of the item, with free return shipping. We strongly suggest that you check your order after receiving it to be sure that it is in proper working order. Items purchased that are subject to buyer\u2019s remorse or negligence can be returned for a refund within 30 days minus a 15% restocking fee and minus shipping expenses. If free shipping was provided for the item, then shipping costs will be deducted from the refund also. All used item returns must include everything that came with the item and in the same condition as received. This includes all packing materials, accessories, manuals and related documentation. Items returned damaged, altered or in any way less than the condition you received it are the responsibility of the buyer. Devaluation from damages, costs of repairs or loss of value will be deducted from the refund in addition to the restocking fee. Items returned because of apparent defects, but found upon return to be because of user error are subject to a 15% restocking fee and no refund on shipping expenses. For example, if you returned a guitar pedal or microphone because \"it is not working\", but it was found that you simply had plugged it in wrong. In this case, we will be glad to send the item back to you with instructions on correct usage, at your further expense for shipping. Techno Empire will not reimburse customs, taxes or any other related fees or expenses for any international returns. Returns have to be processed through several departments. Please understand that it may take 1-3 days to complete your refund after receipt of the returned item.
