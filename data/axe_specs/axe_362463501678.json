{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The 2013 LPJ was Gibson's experiment of providing the core strengths of a high-end Les Paul with the simpler finish (although the 2013 LPJ has been compared to the Gibson LP Standard, it does not have the shine or the bindings of the expensive Gibson Standard model sports). But the quality workmanship of a bonafide U.S. manufactured Gibson shines through, along with the materials and electronics. The nitrocellulose finish for this calibre of guitars is also a plus. The LPJ is not an LP Junior, which is a different series of guitars. Quoting and paraphrasing the MusicRadar review of the 2013 LPJ : \"On the inside, these are the same pickups that used to be fitted to Les Paul Standards in the 1990s\" Contributing to the Spartan aesthetic is a pair of Gibson humbuckers - a 490R in the neck and a 498T in the bridge - that will be sonically familiar to many players. Whether you are a fan or not, on the inside, these are the same pickups that used to be fitted to Les Paul Standards in the 1990s, and still grace plenty of much more expensive guitars in the Gibson USA catalogue, so don't doubt that they have the goods when it comes to pro rock tones. A cursory strum of the LPJ reveals that construction quality here is more than acceptable. Fingerboard edges and fret ends provide a slightly rough ride in places, but more importantly, an unplugged strum reveals a bold, snappy acoustic voice with bags of sustain that bodes well for the LPJ's plugged-in performance. Ultimately, this guitar is for the player who needs a workhorse that is upto par with the top models without worrying too much about coddling it. I have 2 of these as my brother and I bought one and he lost interest in guitars. I will bet that this will be a go-to axe for many guitarists as you will grab it from the stand on your way to the couch ..... The guitar is luthiered with the 10 gauge strings very close to the action with no fret-buzz, beautiful. The guitar is well-cared for but has minor scratches and dings that are superficial and I tried to show in the hi-res shots. Comes with plush gigbag. There is a video of the guitar being played by someone in my YouTube account.", "ItemID": "362463501678", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T19:02:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-20T02:14:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-LPJ-2013-Les-Paul-Cherry-Red-Made-USA-/362463501678", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Redwood City, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3624635016788080_3.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/C8wAAOSwQ-1byoaz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/TI4AAOSwDkBbyoa1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/NCcAAOSwqS5byob6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/V5kAAOSwQqZbyob8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/UycAAOSwVEBbyob9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/S8gAAOSwUulbyocT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/pUEAAOSw1Sdbyodg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/ulYAAOSwz6pbyoeW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/oygAAOSwvK1byrou/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/kkEAAOSwhgtbyrov/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/T84AAOSwE1xby1dn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "94065", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pennywells1974", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 19, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 585.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 585.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 411}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul LPJ 2013 Les Paul Cherry Red-Made in USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 688, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
