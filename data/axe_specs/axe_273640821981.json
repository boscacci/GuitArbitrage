{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here\u2019s a Vintage 1964 Harmony H-47 Mercury Stratotone Electric Guitar with a DeArmond \u201cS-Grill\u201d pickup. This has become one of the more desirable and collectable guitars that Harmony built. This is a great sounding and playing guitar. The pickup sounds strong, the switch and controls are all working properly with no static or buzzing. The action is very clean on every note from one end of the fretboard to the other, with no string buzzing. The adjustable neck is straight, and the frets show very little wear. The tuners all turn smoothly without any play or sloppiness. The neck and body are solid with no cracks, breaks, or repairs. This has some checking in the finish, along with a few nicks and scratches, dings and dents. This has a few of the typical wear marks that you would expect to see on a guitar this old, but overall is in exceptionally good condition for being over 50 years old. The only thing not original is the bridge has been upgraded from the wooden floating bridge to one with adjustable saddles. I have tried to show as much in the photos as possible. Please use the magnifier to view them close up, as they are part of the description. Shipping is UPS or Fed-Ex, but we sometimes will ship Priority Mail for faster delivery depending on its destination. I am not shipping internationally at this time, and can only ship to addresses within the US.
