These tend to be cleaner-sounding, and not aggressive. You\u2019ll wonder why you didn\u2019t make the switch earlier. \u00a0 \ufffc \ufffcFAQ\u2019s: 1. What\u2019s the difference between the Stock Tele and\u00a0the Blues Special\u00a0Tele? The Stock Tele is more true to Vintage Specs, and thus will sound brighter, clearer, and more open. The Blues Special Tele will sound thicker, darker, and more powerful. Stock Tele is for those who want the most twang out of their guitar. 2. What Stagger do I choose? Ideally, we always recommend a Hybrid Neck (raised D). Choose Stock Bridge Stagger if you have a guitar with a round to medium fingerboard radius: 7.25\u2033 \u2013 10\u2033. Choose Hybrid if you have a flatter or compound radius (11+\u201d). 3. How far away from the strings does the pickup need to be?\u00a0Push your Low E String down at the highest fret. Measure from the top of the pole piece to the bottom of the string. Ideal starting location should be 1/8? on the bass string, and 1/16? on the treble string, when the High E string is pushed down at highest fret. 4. Wiring Diagrams?\u00a0Here! \u00a0 \ufffcTECHNICAL INFORMATION: Materials Stock Telecaster Sets are wound with 42-Gauge Plain Enamel Wire in the Bridge and 43 Gauge Plain Enamel Wire in the Neck.
