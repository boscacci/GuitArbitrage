{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For your consideration is an incredible JET Earlewood in Bronze Idol. The quality of this top is unreal. Jeffrey said finding quilt off this caliper is almost impossible now. The depth and dimension is a sight to behold. The guitar is in outstanding condition and looks new. There are a couple of finish flaws in between the pickups below the strings. You have to look at an angle in light to see them. Looks like a few very small fish eyes. The neck on this JET is thinner than the others I had and is the most comfortable. This Earlewood also has the best tone of the 7 I have had through here. I would never sell it but a Custom build came up I really want. I ship immediately insured and pack great inside and outside of the case.", "ItemID": "202571637285", "EndTime": "2019-01-21T12:31:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T18:09:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/JET-Jeffrey-Earle-Terwilliger-Earlewood-Bronze-Idol-Electric-Guitar-/202571637285", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Buckingham, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025716372858080_5.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-dcAAOSwh7tcRMaa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5uEAAOSwZKlcRLlH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gWEAAOSwzExcRLkS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/42UAAOSwGPNcRLka/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KIIAAOSwnh5cRLkd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NDkAAOSwb-1cRLj9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rRkAAOSwQXlcRLkf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7sAAAOSwXI1cRLk0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gygAAOSwsTJcRLkp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "18912", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gbopp22", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1118, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 389}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "JET Jeffrey Earle Terwilliger Earlewood Bronze Idol Electric Guitar", "HitCount": 50, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
