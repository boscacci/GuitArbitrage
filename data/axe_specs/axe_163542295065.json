{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1960 Silvertone by Danelectro Vintage Shortscale \"Wish Book\" Guitar U-1. GUITAR IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION CONSIDERING IT'S AGE. PREVIOS OWNER PAINTED IT RED AND THE HEADSTOCK WHITE. ALL ELECTRONICS WORK AS THEY SHOULD. PLAYS GREAT AND SOUNDS AMAZING. GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY BIDDING. Crafted by Danelectro in the USA, this rare and complete Silvertone model was only offered in the 1958-60 Sears \"Wish Book\" Christmas catalog, and not available in stores like the majority of Silvertone's other offerings. Also unique among Danelectro's offerings under the Silvertone brand, this guitar features the signature Danelectro \"coke bottle\" headstock and has a solid center block on the body, a feature not seen beyond the very early '60s. A short scale affair targeted to budding players who would find this Silvertone under the Christmas tree, the guitar has a compact 23 1/4\" scale length and a resulting shorter neck on a full-size Danelectro U-1 body. The single lipstick single coil pickup is centrally placed, providing the perfect balance of jangle and warmth. Both sweet and twangy, the uncommon pickup placement on this Danelectro-made guitar combined with the solid poplar center block results in a tone you simply can't get from any other Dano.
