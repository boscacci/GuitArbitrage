It comes in a hard shell case. Serial number in pictures. Date from neck in pictures. The guitar is in used condition. It does have its scratches from use and age. There is some crackling of the finish. I do see some wear on the fretboard. It comes with the tremelo. It needs new strings(the high E is currently not on it. it broke) Some of the pickguard screws are rust discolored. The backplate looks to be a replacement and they made new screw holes in the back to accommodate it... It has G&L Tuners and SCN pickups. Normal playwear that you'd except on it.
