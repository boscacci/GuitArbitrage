You are looking at a 2018 Jackson HT6 Misha Mansoor Signature Pro Series Electric Guitar. Misha Mansoor, lead guitarist for progressive metal band Periphery, has made a name for himself as a trailblazer of style and innovation over the past decade. Known for his speed and palm-muted lead attack known as djent, Mansoor has been a Jackson guitar player from nearly day one of his career. Mansoor and Jackson have now teamed up to bring you the Pro Series Signature Misha Mansoor Juggernaut HT6FM. The Mansoor Juggernaut HT6FM features a basswood body with flame maple top and a 1-piece bolt-on maple speed neck with graphite reinforcement and wrap-around heel for comfort. To add even more metal playability, the HT6FM also has a 16\" flat-radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets and offset inlay dots. Finally, a pair of smoking-hot Jackson MM1 humbuckers brings killer sonic versatility to this metal workhorse guitar. The Pro Series Signature Misha Mansoor Juggernaut HT6FM features a basswood body with flame maple top, one-piece bolt-on maple neck with graphite reinforcement and wrap-around heel for greater playing comfort, 16\u201d flat radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets, offset dot inlays, illuminating side-dots, and heel-mount truss rod adjustment wheel. Not willing to sacrifice tone, Mansoor spent considerable time working with Jackson to develop new, killer-sounding Jackson MM1 pickups, which can be shaped with a single volume control, a single tone control with push/pull select and a five-way blade switch. Available in a stage-stealing Scarlet Burst finish, this axe also features a Jackson HT6 string-through-body hardtail bridge, die-cast locking tuners, black hardware and reverse Jackson 3x3 (3 over, 3 under) AT-1 headstock.
