{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is one of the original Ola Englund Signature Series guitars from Washburn. This is the Solar 16, six string guitar with Original Floyd Rose tremolo. The tremolo has been upgraded with a big brass block and brass claw. The pickups are Duncan Solars which were only available on this series of guitars. The guitar also features maple long set neck construction, with Alder body, ebony fretboard, Grover tuners, Buzz Feiten tuning system, and a matte black finish. It is currently set up with a fresh set of D\u2019Dario XL\u2019s - 10\u2019s with wound third string. I purchased this guitar New and have been its only owner. This was not one of the \u201cB stock\u201d guitars that you typically up for sale - those have a \u201c2\u201d stamped on the back of the headstock. It has never been gigged, and has been cased most of the time that I\u2019ve owned it. (It did not come with a case, and it is not being offered with a case in this listing)The guitar has less than 25 hours of playing time on it. The cavity covers still have the protective plastic on them. That said, it isn\u2019t perfect. There is one small ding between the cavity covers, on the back of the guitar, but no other dents, or chips or scratches. There is some smoothing of the matte finish on the back of the neck, which is normal for all matte finished guitars. The guitar plays beautifully with no buzzing or strange noises, and no discernible fretwear at all. It is remarkably quiet when at rest, and all electronics function perfectly. It has a fast, comfortable neck, with large cutaways for easy access to the upper frets. Although I do like this guitar quite a bit, it tends to get lost in my collection... I\u2019m a BC Rich guy at heart, and that\u2019s what I always find myself reaching for. So I\u2019ve decided to sell this guitar to help fund some other projects. Shipping is free within the lower 48 states. No international shipping - period. I typically use Fed-Ex, since I\u2019ve never had an issue with them, and they allow you to customize your delivery (a signature will be required.)", "ItemID": "123582212646", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T23:56:53.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T15:52:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-Ola-Englund-Signature-Guitar-/123582212646", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Spencer, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235822126468080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jCYAAOSwg1JcMhtJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0psAAOSwdGZcMhtS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lU8AAOSwa1hcMhtL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Sm4AAOSwOcpcMhtO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6NUAAOSw0~pcMhtQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Z5cAAOSwfvtcMhtT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LcYAAOSwltxcMhtV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-AoAAOSw4sNcMhtM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8s4AAOSwqnlcMhtX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "14883", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "avienmael", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1907, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 765.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 174}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn Ola Englund Signature Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}]}, "HitCount": 1271, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
