The Gibson 2016 Limited Vintage Copper Non-Reverse Firebird brings back the revolutionary design from 1965 with some modern-day upgrades! The 2016 Limited Vintage Copper Non-Reverse Firebird is a recreation of the legendary design that Gibson made famous in 1965, when Gibson redesigned the Firebird and gave it a more streamlined look. The 2016 Limited Edition Firebird captures the essence of this classic while incorporating some modern components to satisfy today\u2019s players. The solid mahogany neck set into a mahogany body, maximizing sustain and resonance. The body also sports a belly contour to enhance player comfort. The neck has been carved into an ultra-slim profile for high velocity soloing, and a 22 fret fingerboard tops it all off. This current edition of the Firebird Non-Reverse has been outfitted with a pair of 57 Classic Humbuckers pickups with Alnico II magnets to deliver those fat tones. A no-nonsense control panel features a 3-way selector switch, along with master volume and a master tone control.The blackened hardware includes a tune-o-matic bridge and stop tailpiece, along with high-quality Mini Grover kidney button tuners for extreme tuning precision.
