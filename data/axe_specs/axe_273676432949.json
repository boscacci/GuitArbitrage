{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Rare Gorgeous Custom Color 80s Carvin Lefty DC200 Stereo Guitar w Hard Case. serial #. 26106 (late 80s). made in USA Florescent Violet Pearl ?? This sweet old gal is not mint, but is so very nice throughout :-). As the pics show, she is beautiful from every side with only a few tiny nics and scratches. No belt buckle rash. The worst flaws are there is wear to the knobs/ brass and a prior owner removed the top lock. It even came with two different tremolo bars, a palm bar and a more standard long bar with brass tip. The neck is sweet and the frets are in excellent condition. All electronics work fine with just a smidge of static in a couple knobs (should work out with play). The strings are getting near their end and rather than guess your favorite, I put both D\u2019Adario 9\u2019s and 10\u2019s in the case for your next change. This thing is oh so cool :-). Includes its matching Carvin Hard case in very good condition (solid, good hardware and protects well, some wear). As with all our fine instruments, we understand the bond between player and instrument and always offer a 30 day play/return policy with No restocking fee.
