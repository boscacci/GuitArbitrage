{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is an 2018 Epiphone Les Paul Standard Pro electric guitar. The neck was partially broken at the headstock. The guitar was never played, brand new prior to this. It was a pretty clean break with minimal splintering. It\u2019s the best type of break you can hope for if it\u2019s going to happen! Franklin Tite Bond was used to glue the headstock back into place. Its a strong repair and aligned properly. You can barely feel the crack line when playing. It\u2019s obvious however when visually inspecting. Some cloudiness in the finish around the repaired area. It\u2019s totally solid now and will not cause issues. Glued seams are often much stronger than the wood itself. Overall, the guitar is in excellent playing shape. The finish is excellent but I won\u2019t say mint. The action is pretty low and the neck profile is a slim 60\u2019s. The neck is straight and truss rod functions as it should. The frets are in mint shape. All electronics are checked and sound great. I will ship well packaged in a proper box.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "202565528764", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T05:51:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-14T02:53:45.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2018-Epiphone-Les-Paul-Standard-Pro-Electric-Guitar-Sunburst-Repaired-/202565528764", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025655287648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/y9sAAOSw2bFcO~PE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0-oAAOSwseFcO~PH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v6MAAOSwuA9cO~PF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TBgAAOSwvytcO~PI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pJkAAOSwIbtcO~PK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TF4AAOSwxx1cO~PL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UNIAAOSwlEBcO~PM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xP4AAOSwIqxcO~PR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/encAAOSwxJ9cO~PO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/M24AAOSwzm1cO~PP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2xQAAOSwY4JcO~PS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TkYAAOSwoylcO~PT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6611, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 20}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2018 Epiphone Les Paul Standard Pro Electric Guitar Sunburst Repaired", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 401, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
