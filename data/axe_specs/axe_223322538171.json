{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are bidding on a Cort Larry Coryell Signature Model LCS-1 that is in very good player condition. This guitar sounds as beautiful as it looks, and the photos don't even do it justice! Anything that looks like scratches on the body are just glares from lights, there are no scratches or dings on this guitar. This is a large bodied Hollow body Jazz guitar with Flamed Maple sides and back, and a Spruce top. It has a Maple neck with a beautiful inlaid fretboard, and a floating bridge. The frets are medium to low, and this guitar plays effortlessly as it should with flat wound jazz strings. Genuine Seymour Duncan pick-ups make this guitar sound amazing. If you are looking for a Jazz guitar, you will not be disappointed, the sound from this guitar is a true delight. There are 2 models of this guitar, this is the more expensive top of the line model, not to be confused with the LCS-2 model, which is built with different sound woods, and has Duncan Designed pick-ups. The sound difference between the two models is huge, I should know, I also own one of the less expensive models. I am including a used TKL hard case that fits the guitar great. I will ship within the U.S. only. You can find all of the specs on this guitar online.", "ItemID": "223322538171", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T19:02:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-12T19:02:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Cort-Larry-Coryell-LCS-1-Beautiful-looking-and-sounding-Jazz-Box-Hollowbody-/223322538171", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Oregon, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233225381718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/CjYAAOSwCNlcOjRZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/zmMAAOSw4zdcOjRb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BfsAAOSwjoFcOjRe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/XecAAOSwvwRcOjRg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/InkAAOSw-FRcOjR4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/AC8AAOSwwgBcOjR6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Es8AAOSwKSlcOjR9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/-X0AAOSwoRpcOjR~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/sRgAAOSwxtVcOjSB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/~NQAAOSwFZZcOjSD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/yB4AAOSwiwZcOjSG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "53575", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jazztrax", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 711, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1066}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Cort Larry Coryell LCS-1, Beautiful looking and sounding Jazz Box Hollowbody", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Cort"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 74, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 454.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
