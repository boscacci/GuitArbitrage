You are looking at a Vintage 1981 Gibson Sonex-180 Deluxe Electric Guitar. In production from 1980-1984, these economy models made to compete with a Fender Stratocaster. Basically, you had a Les Paul body shape with a bolt on neck and dual humbuckers. The Sonex-180 Deluxe filled the void between really expensive well made guitars and really cheap not made well guitars. In the early 1980's there were some Japanese lower end guitars that were decent guitars, so the Sonex was built to compete with the Fender Strat and the Japanese imports. They were made from a synthetic material called Resonwood, and manufactured with Multi-phonic body construction. \"The Sonex Multi-phonic\u2122 body is composed of Resonwood surrounding an inner tone wood core. The tone wood core not only acts as the anchor point for the neck, it also adds acoustic resonance and exceptional body resilience. The Sonex body is so resilient, that its structural properties survived extreme testing in temperatures ranging from \u221240 \u00b0F to 180 \u00b0F.\" The Sonex-180 Deluxe is a great playing and sounding guitar. Dual Humbuckers, Rosewood Fretboard, 24.75\" Scale, three-position pick-up selector switch, Tune-0-Matic Bridge', stop bar tailpiece and volume/tone control speed knobs. In recent years, they have found a cult like following with Alternative / Indie Rockers. Allan Harper of the Limitations, Lee Ving of Fear and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth are just a few of the notable players. Our luthier did a complete setup. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Rare solid-color silver. Less than 100 (by factory record) solid-color silver units were produced, making it the rarest of the Sonex models. Nut Width: 1.68\" Weight: 9.10 lbs. Case is NOT Included Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. The neck pickup has been changed. The bridge pickup is the original zebra humbucker. Cosmetics: Good \"Relic\" Condition. There are scuffs, scratches, chips, dings and dents on both sides of the body. Light strumming scratches on the pickguard as well as on the top. The back has some minor belt buckle rash scratches. The neck has some cool wear marks from being played. (See picture #6, #8). Fretboard in great shape. Plenty of life here. Very Authentic. The wear is what gives this Gibson it's charm. Dripping with \"Mojo\". It is used. Not perfect. Overall, a really nice guitar. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story.
