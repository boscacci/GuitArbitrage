{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2011 Gibson SG StandardHere is a genuine American made 2011 Gibson SG Standard! I'm not sure what the finish color is called, but it's a very dark red (maybe Wine Red). You can still see the wood grain through the finish. Actual weight is 6 lbs 11 oz.The body is in good condition overall and has some small dings, scratches and marks. This one was not a closet queen and has the typical wear and tear for a used guitar. No cracks, damage to the wood or structural issues.The neck is straight and the frets show only light wear. It's in excellent playing condition with no dead frets or other major issues. The fretboard is clean and the back of the neck has one small ding. The headstock has dings on the top corners and top edge. No cracks or repairs. The tuners have been changed to Klusons and I have not removed them, but there should not be any extra holes. The guitar had changed pickups when I got it, so I put in a set of the correct 490R and 498T's. The tailpiece has some worn areas from where the strings were wrapped around the top and the pickguard has a large worn spot. It comes with the original case which has some general wear on the outside. All of the latches, hinges and handle are in excellent working order and the interior has no bad odors.Please note that I do not set up my guitars before mailing. I have played it and everything is great as far as I'm concerned, but you may need to change the strings, adjust the action or do other maintenece to get it to your preferences.
