{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Listed is a modified Telecaster consisting of a genuine Fender MIM '50s reissue road worn neck and a non-fender hard ash body finished in lake placid blue nitro. The instrument is only a few months old, so all wear and scratches were deliberately made as part of the relic job. The guitar itself is in 100% working condition. Here are the full specs: Neck: Fender MIM '50s reissue road worn TelecasterBody: Northern hard ash TelecasterPickups: Lollar Tele Special neck & bridgeWiring: Emerson Custom 4-way switch Telecaster (Master volume and tone)Tuners: Brad Paisley road worn vintage Tele tunersHardware: Genuine Fender hardware w/ relic job This guitar is an attempt to recreate a '50s looking aged Telecaster with '60s wiring and an added 4th sound (Both pickups in series). The body is northern hard ash, so be aware that this guitar is heavy like they used to be. The Lollar pickups sound great with the pre-wired harness and give the guitar a nice traditional twangy sound.The electronics are of the highest quality and would be an excellent upgrade to say a Fender Standard Tele. Please contact me with any additional questions.", "ItemID": "163355262549", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T22:34:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T22:34:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-Lake-Placid-Blue-Nitro-Relic-w-Lollar-Pickups-4-Way-Switch-/163355262549", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Nashville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633552625498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FlIAAOSwCtNb32Gq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/42UAAOSw21Rb32Gy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vbYAAOSwNphb32HJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xisAAOSwK65b32HQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q98AAOSwKMNb32FC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uzgAAOSwoW1b32Hb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UBoAAOSwsqdb32Js/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t1kAAOSwnh9b323d/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ifEAAOSwG1Vb32Hj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-ZwAAOSwHStb32Ji/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dsIAAOSwGmZb322z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-GkAAOSwtmNb323n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37201", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mattheoconno_2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 43, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 490.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 490.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***9", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 85}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster - Lake Placid Blue Nitro Relic w Lollar Pickups & 4-Way Switch", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["4-way Switch", "Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 593, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 495.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Apart from the relic job, this guitar is in perfect working order.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
