{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Seasons greetings travellers....... Escape the inane conversations and avoid the Christmas cliches with this trusty players grade/project guitar. This is a super rare Eko Sombrero six stringer, one of their higher tier models with a good tone, nice side dot inlays and a generally great mojo! So what is wrong with it? Not that much really, plays well and as it should with no structural issues. Cosmetically there are some areas of historic restoration, wear and repair, around the binding lower bout shown in photo's, these could be blended in more effectively. The body has been refinished sometime, done to an average and non professional standard which could also be improved, or cut back/polished to your preferences. The pickguard may need resecuring These are seldom seen guitars and worthy of work, or if that isn't your thing then this a fine player to be appreciated as she is. Over to you now, so Merry Christmas and a doff of the hat, or Sombrero perhaps? Enjoy!", "ItemID": "163417802288", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T19:25:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-06T19:25:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/RARE-Vintage-Eko-Sombrero-VI-Acoustic-Guitar-c-1970-Repair-Project-/163417802288", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Manchester", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634178022888080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/tzYAAOSwsqxcCVyW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/hgMAAOSwLKhcCVxW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/MpMAAOSwjkZcCVuf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/FAMAAOSwiqBcCVul/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/aFEAAOSwTiVcCVyM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/TycAAOSwkDtcCVvh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/~o4AAOSwM5tcCVwT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/-LsAAOSwcH5cCVwg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/U1cAAOSwrpJcCVws/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/82EAAOSw8hdcCVxF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/SK8AAOSw1KRcCVuw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/hk4AAOSwLKhcCVyB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "m202nr", "PrimaryCategoryID": "118979", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Vintage Musical Instruments:Vintage Guitars & Basses:Acoustic Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "afterlife_acoustics", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 99, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 24, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 101.41, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 77.0, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 284}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "UK", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "\u2606 RARE \u2606 Vintage Eko Sombrero VI Acoustic Guitar c.1970 (Repair Project?) \u2606", "HitCount": 1958, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:181162:181163:118979", "SecondaryCategoryID": "33034", "SecondaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "SecondaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "GB", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 79.0, "CurrencyID": "GBP"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Complete, original, in playable condition may require some of your skills", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
