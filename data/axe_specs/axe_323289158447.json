{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Schecter Tele Genesis - Mid 80s - Electric GuitarYou are buying a pre-owned Genesis by Schecter in great working condition!! Light scuffs and minor dust are present. The serial number is G25352. From the research I did on this, I believe it is from the mid 80s. The body is in great shape. There are minor scratches throughout on the body and pick guard from normal usage. There are a few minor chips in the paint. I tried to show all imperfections in the pictures. The neck is straight and she plays really nicely. The color is a beautiful pearl cranberry that pops when sunlight hits it. All knobs and pickups work as they should. The back plate is missing.Thanks for looking! Please check our other auctions located in our eBay store!!
