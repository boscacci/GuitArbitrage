{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage 1986 Lotus RH electric Les Paul clone. L570 is the model number. Beware of uneducated sellers mis-labeling lesser instruments as L570s. I do not think Lotus or Morris issued an LP-type guitar of any higher class or quality than this series. I believe it originated from the Moridaira factory in Japan. This is a set-neck instrument: it seems most of the set-neck or thru-neck late '70s to late '80s Japanese clones were given far better/costlier appointments than the bolt-neck clones of the same period. This project guitar features a wine-red finish with some very nice woodgrain flame on numerous areas of the instrument, including an impressive-looking top. rosewood fingerboard. The frets are OK. I personally prefer them a bit lower/smaller on LP guitars. 2 vol/2 tone, small-body Japanese pots, commonplace for many guitars during this period. Cream-colored trim; the deluxe body binding has aged nicely in spots. Open-book headstock contour. Brass nut (which is loose, not currently glued to the neck) and saddles. missing, notably, are the guitar pickups/rings/hardware associated with pickups; the pickup select/toggle switch; three of the plastic neck inlays (as 3rd, 5th, and 7th fret markers); the pickguard, the truss rod cover, and the control cavity cover; also, the pickup phase switch's tip is broken away; the body is still there, so you have a start as far as replacement parts. The intrepid DIYer may wish to source a cheaper or junky Morris/Lotus/Hohner/Washburn which could provide a source for identical parts used on this axe.
