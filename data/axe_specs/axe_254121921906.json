Up for auction is this very rare 2001 Epiphone Demon... Production was limited to only 1000 units worldwide, serial number for this one is U01051222. Body Color is metallic black and is in good condition having only one very small ding on the upper backside corner (see photo with ink pen tip comparison ). You will be hard-pressed to find one of these in nicer condition than this one AND It is rare to find one of these guitars with the original case which is included in the auction. The case does have it's fair share of scuffs, scrapes, dings and wear marks but it serves its purpose and all latches are in tack and properly working. The guitar has been set up by a local professional tech with fairly low action and no buzzing or fret out. It plays great! This guitar is from the hard to find E-series which was made in Korea with inspection/setup done in Nashville, TN. Epiphone only produced the Demon V between 2001 and 2002. It has a modified V-shaped solid hardwood body, with a shorter lower horn. The bolt on maple neck has a slim-taper profile,Indianrosewood fingerboard with a satin finish. Has a tune-o-matic bridge with strings through body, and two E-series Ultra-Hot humbucking pickups (neck pickup DC resistance: 12 k, bridge pickup DC resistance:16 k). This Demon is the E-Series take on a classic Randy Rhoads V, and is from the Hard Body Series. Here is your chance to get a guitar that very few other collectors have. It will be packed and shipped with the greatest of care. Please do not hesitate to ask questions. If you would like more photos just ask and I will make sure you get them.
