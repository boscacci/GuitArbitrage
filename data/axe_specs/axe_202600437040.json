{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "What a great guitar , does it all ! Coil tap humbuckers, Piezo and tremolo ! + EZ lock locking tuners. Guitars that play this well and have these features would easily be well over $1000 ! My son has been using this and really enjoying it but he uses some very strange drop tunings, with the changing tunings we have decided to get a fixed bridge guitar. Some \" dents\" and surface scuffs and wear, but nothing of consequence. Just an absolutely wonderful guitar. comes with a hard case that is in great shape. The neck on this guitar is fantastic, so comfortable and fast, I play early 90's USA G&L's , I love the feel of this guitar . If I wasn't so addicted to the sound of G&L MFD pickups I would be keeping it for myself.**Ask questions prior to bid/ purchase, I ship fast usually via Fedex , Continental USA only ! ***A player's guitar with the signature capabilities of the high-end Fly in a beautiful mahogany body.The Parker P-44V Electric Guitar has a light, ergonomic body made of a single piece of mahogany that offers plenty of sustain.
