But what I especially like is this looks. The neck is gibson medium scale and, narrow neck. I recommend to short fingers guitar players. RGX will be compared with Ibanez RG. But I think that I resemble an ESP guitars. When I grasp the neck of RGX, I remember the ESP guitar. About guitar play, Current state, the space between the strings and the frets is very narrow. And, remaining amount of the Frets are many. Thanks to that, I feels very easy to play the guitar. About the pickups, It is YAMAHA Original. However the sound of the bridge pickup, I feels like a Stratocaster. I felt like it was a single coil. If you dislike this bridge's output sound, I recommend you change the bridge's pickup.
