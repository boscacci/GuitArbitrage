{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "IBANEZAG95ARTCORE EXPRESSIONELECTRIC GUITARWITH CASE Beautiful and well maintained Ibanez AG95 Artcore Expression guitar. It does come with case pictured. I purchased this guitar and really like it. However, I am mainly an acoustic guitar player and this guitar rarely gets played. I recently changed the strings and the guitar is ALWAYS kept in the case and is regularly humidified. Very well cared for guitar. The following was taken from the Ibanez website information: Smaller than traditional full-hollow bodies with topnotch articulation and playability.The Ibanez Artcore Expressionist AG95 full-hollow electric guitar gives you an amazing guitar at an affordable price. You also get the quality and tone you expect from Ibanez, the guitar company with over four decades of experience making full and semi-acoustic guitars. Unlike many so-called full-hollow guitars in the more affordable price ranges that feature soundblocks, Ibanez Artcore full-acoustic guitars are truly full-hollow. The figured bubinga AG95 guitar is crafted with a 3-piece maple/mahogany neck for additional stability and strength. Super 58 pickups deliver the smooth, nuanced tones and the biting growl of blues.
