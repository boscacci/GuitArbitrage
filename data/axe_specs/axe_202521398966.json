{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Gibson Les Paul Faded T 2017. Made in USA. I am the 2nd owner. The original owner bought this guitar for his son who only put a few hours of playing on it. I have put about 20 hours of playing on it. It is in very good condition. I will not say \"mint\" because there is some light brushing from picks on the pick-guard, and a tiny bit on the body. Look at the photos, this guitar is in great shape. The neck is straight, the guitar is set up with .009 - .046 strings, which is the factory set up. Compared to some LPJ's that I have owned, this guitar is not dark or muddy, it has a good balanced tone with lots of sustain. Everything is stock, but the strings are new Ernie Ball's. The 490R - 490T pickup set sounds killer in this guitar, they are AlNiCo II, very, very close in tone to the Gibson '57 Classic / '57 Classic Plus set, with the bridge just a bit more pronounced in the mids than the '57 Plus. I am only selling this guitar to raise some Christmas cash! This is an excellent introduction to Les Paul tone, at less than half the price of a Les Paul Standard. It has a Mahogany body with weight relief, a thick Maple top, Maple neck, and thick Rosewood fingerboard. The frets are in perfect shape with their whole lifespan ahead of them. Much better starter Les Paul than an Epiphone. This particular guitar would make a great piece for a collector as well, because it is in very good cosmetic shape. Oh, and it looks pretty cool too. Includes thick padded Gibson gig bag, ownership card with serial and model number - date of manufacture, Owner's Manual for that year, polishing cloth, Truss rod key, Allen key for bridge height adjustment. If you do an internet search for Gibson Les Paul Faded 2017 T - you can easily find more specs. The guitar will ship via UPS, bubble-wrapped in a proper U-Line guitar box.", "ItemID": "202521398966", "EndTime": "2018-12-08T18:00:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-01T18:00:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Les-Paul-Faded-2017-T-excellent-condition-Gibson-gig-bag-case-candy-/202521398966", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Edmonton, Alberta", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025213989668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/6e0AAOSwcqxcAoGV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/wgsAAOSwBfhcAoGf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/6q0AAOSwG1JcAoGp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/gcMAAOSwx9lcAoA9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/vLcAAOSw0YlcAoBA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/KOIAAOSwdgxcAoBD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/HM8AAOSwm51cAoBH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/FD0AAOSwe~lcAoBK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/~mgAAOSw-rxcAoBN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/uaMAAOSwtaBcAoBP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/aKwAAOSw8DpcAoBT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/3ocAAOSwMI1cAoBW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "T5B 3P8", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "scatter_man", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 155, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 460.07, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 20}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "Asia", "AU"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Les Paul Faded 2017 T - excellent condition with Gibson gig bag - case candy", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Faded 2017 T"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Worn Brown"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 265, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 620.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition with light brushing on pickguard, a tiny bit on guitar body.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
