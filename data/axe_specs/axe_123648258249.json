PLEASE SEE ALL THE PICS. Introduced by Fender in mid 1987, the USA Strat Plus model was was the highest-end production model of its time. This 26 year old instrument is in excellent, original condition, with just some light surface scratches/indents you have to turn in the light to see - looks new from a few feet away. Also included original Fender USA \"red label\" case, case keys, Fender \"monogram\" strap, strap locks, trem arm, and truss rod and saddle height allen wrenches. The electronics feature three Gold Lace Sensor pickups designed to give a '50s single coil Strat sound with a lot of chime but with no hum(same as the original Eric Clapton Strat model), master volume control, master TBX tone control, master mid range control with \"center detent\" and 5-way pickup selector switch. More original \"Plus\" features: an LSR roller nut, Schaller \"F\" logo locking tuners, and Hipshot Tremsetter(see pic), which compensates for string tension should a string break, keeping the guitar in tune. Other original specs include the American 2-point synchronized Tremolo, three-ply white pickguard, Maple neck, and Rosewood fretboard with 22 medium-jumbo frets. This beautiful collectible Stratocaster looks awesome, plays exceptionally well, and the Lace Sensors sound great - played through an original 1965 Princeton Reverb they are virtually noiseless!
