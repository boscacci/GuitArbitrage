{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "The Sparrowhawk is the newest LTD Signature Series guitar for Bill Kelliher of the respected American metal band Mastodon. With a body shape designed by Bill based on elements of a number of different guitars he's admired, the Sparrowhawk has a vibe all of its own, while still retaining some classic aspects that make it outstanding for a variety of different genres. It features a set of Lace Sensor \u201cDivinators\u201d LTD pickups with matte black covers, which were specially designed for our LTD Bill Kelliher Signature Series models and not available anywhere else. Push-pull coil-splitting control is wired separately for each pickup for a variety of tones (pull up on tone knob for neck pickup coil split, and up on volume knob to split bridge pickup). The Sparrowhawk has a solid feel, with a maple-capped mahogany body, set-thru construction, and a smooth heel joint for fast access to the highest frets. It offers a three-piece mahogany neck with satin finish, a 22-fret ebony fingerboard with block inlays, and a TonePros locking TOM bridge and tailpiece to provide stability and sustain. Never set-up only played when tuned... and that was only 1 time!!!Do not be fooled... this is just like NEW! Plastic still on the pickguard.NO CASE/BAG. Factory original box.
