Traditionally used in the bridge position of your seven string guitar, this pickup will make your leads slice right through even the densest mix. Additional Guitar Info Unknown Seller note: I picked this up second-hand and I am not certain of its history; I just thought it was really cool and had to have it. I can attempt to answer questions, but I\u2018m not real familiar with 7-stringed instruments /or this brand/model. I know it\u2019s rare (possibly a one-off) and sounds heavy and awesome with high-gain distortion! I\u2019m a rhythm, 6-string, rock guitarist; and, though a lot of fun, it\u2019s not really my thing. If you\u2019re a \u201cmetal head\u201d \u2014 which I am no longer \u2014 this may be just what you\u2019ve been looking for. If you\u2019re a \u201cshredder\u201d who plays all over the neck, you may want a professional setup. The two-piece top is slightly separating where it was originally glued (possibly caused by climate changes,) but holding strong and no real cause for concern (see last 3 pics.) The High-E string gets caught up on the 2-3rd fret occasionally; unruly fret?
