{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2004 Fender 50th Anniversary American Stratocaster HSS w/ Hard case AND New pack of Super Slinky Strings (AS IS Please read description) No returns 2004 Fender 50th Anniversary American Stratocaster HSS with custom sparkle blue paint scheme. Guitar is in good working order but does need some work. There is a chip on back side in the paint from playing live, the top of the switch has fallen off and needs new strings (provided). Does have strap locks installed. No Strap provided. Any other repairs I'm not aware of as this has been in it's case for about 2 years since i stopped playing live. Hence \"as is\". This guitar is perfect for the tech savy musicians who love repairing and making custom gear. I'm not the most tech savy person out there but please ask any questions you may have and i will try to answer. I really would like to see this guitar go to a good home and be taken care of and used to it's potential. Really was a great guitar for me.", "ItemID": "153324082031", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T23:35:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T23:35:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-American-Deluxe-Stratocaster-HSS-Custom-paint-Blue-Sparkle-2004-READ-/153324082031", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Martinsburg, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533240820318080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QUcAAOSw~JFcKqHU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I2AAAOSw9xJcKqHc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DMYAAOSwF5VcKqHk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3tMAAOSwsftcKqHu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Z7MAAOSw5YlcKqH0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2lgAAOSwjthcKqID/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/654AAOSwS2lcKqII/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BMkAAOSwPA1cKqIM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oTkAAOSwlx9cKqIR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Tx0AAOSwZ4RcKqIY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "25405", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rhbai-70", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 19, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 685.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 685.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 129}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS Custom paint Blue Sparkle 2004 (READ) ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["American Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster HSS"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 388, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 695.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
