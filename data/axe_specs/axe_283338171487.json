{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "An outstandingly versatile guitar. I am only selling it because I am upgrading to to Montreal TriplePlay version. xtSA Trans Black FlameSKU: 025503USD$ 1,395.00Map: USD$ 1,150.00I am only selling this because I am getting another Godin. A jack-of-all-trades and master of all of them, the xtSA\u2019s incredible sound power begins with three distinct voices: electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and synth.The xtSA delivers big-time electric sounds via the Godin humbucker-single-humbucker pickup configuration and thanks to a special 5-way switch setup, extra meaty humbucker tones co-exist with glassy split-coil sounds in the second and forth positions. Turn down the electric output and raise the volume on the RMC transducer saddles and the xtSA becomes an incredibly authentic-sounding \u2018acoustic\u2019 guitar. The acoustic voice of the xtSA is enhanced by an onboard preamp with a three-way graphic EQ. The two outputs are set up so that the electric and acoustic voices can be blended while using a single patch cord or at the amp/mixer via both outputs. Also, the xtSA\u2019s synth tracking, which simply put, is the best in the business. As with all of Godin synth-ready instruments, a built-in 13-pin connector provides direct access to all Roland\u2122 GR-Series synths as well as most other 13-pin devices. All of this sound power would be a lot less interesting if the guitar didn\u2019t feel great but the xtSA sure does, thanks to the same 25\u00bd\u201d scale and mahogany neck used on the Godin LGX-SA flagship guitar. The Richlite\u00ae fingerboard is shaped with Godin\u2019s ergocut technique and equipped with medium jumbo frets. The body is made of a silver leaf maple center with poplar wings and is topped with a Premium grade veneer of highly figured Koa.Share NowFacebookTwitterGoogle+EmailShareSPECS :Show MoreBodySilver Leaf Maple Center with Poplar WingsNeckMahoganyFingerboardRichliteScale Length25.5\" (647.7 mm)Nut Width1.6875\" (42.8625 mm)Neck PickupCustom Godin humbuckerMiddle PickupGodin Single CoilBridge PickupGodin Custom HumbuckerColorTrans Black FlameFinishHigh Gloss", "ItemID": "283338171487", "EndTime": "2019-01-14T01:30:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-13T23:35:39.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Godin-xtSA-Flame-Electric-Guitar-Transparent-Black-JUST-REDUCED-/283338171487", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Phoenix, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833381714878080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODExWDE2MDA=/z/J5QAAOSwG6tcKSHG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OVgxNjAw/z/zLQAAOSwektcKSHJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFgxNjAw/z/NuUAAOSw1qhcKSHL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTk0WDE2MDA=/z/59cAAOSwxO9cKSHO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OFgxNjAw/z/x6UAAOSwjolcKSHQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEwMlgxNjAw/z/5D4AAOSwH2VcKSHV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODYxWDE2MDA=/z/RkEAAOSwNqRcKSHY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "85053", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lynnadeck", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 411, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 85}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Godin xtSA Flame Electric Guitar Transparent Black JUST REDUCED", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Features", "Value": ["single-coil", "humbucker", "tremolo bridge with RMC transducers", "acoustic/mix"]}, {"Name": "Style 1", "Value": ["Transparent Black"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Godin"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["xtSA"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["025503 25497 025497 025503 025497 25497", "025503 25497 025497", "025497", "25503", "025503", "25497"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["025497"]}]}, "HitCount": 10, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "70306663", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent, played very little.
