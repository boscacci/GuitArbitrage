{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hate to let this go but you guitar players get it. Sometimes you just gotta make room. Used to play it often in worship when I was the only guitarist. New worship leader, different needs. Sweet guitar and one of the most \u201cplayable \u201c guitars I\u2019ve ever played. If you\u2019re looking at this then you already know what a T5 is. If not, go to Taylor\u2019s website or YouTube. Everything they say is true. The only blemish on this guitar is a small ding on the back. Don\u2019t know how it got there as it was there when I bought it. I tried to show it the best I could in the picture. Will ship in the hard shell case, which as you can see in the picture has a few scuffs. Great sounding guitar and great looking guitar. Will ship US only.", "ItemID": "273540365666", "EndTime": "2018-11-09T23:21:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-02T23:21:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Taylor-T5-C1-2-800-retail-Guitar-Excellent-Condition-2005-Model-/273540365666", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Murrells Inlet, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2735403656668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sjgAAOSw5HZb0Rtk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTA0/z/TD0AAOSwmDBb0Rtg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDcw/z/DfoAAOSwO2hb0Rtf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDQw/z/amcAAOSwwvtb0Rtd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L-oAAOSw71pb0Rti/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0yAAAOSwiJhb0x7x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "29576", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "1mf1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 47, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 10, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1075.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1075.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 738}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Taylor T5 C1 - $2,800 retail Guitar, Excellent Condition-2005 Model", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Taylor"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["T5-C"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 341, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
