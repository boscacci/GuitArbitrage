{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Every year we have a massive blowout sale, that clears out the warehouse of all the junk that piles up over the year. What's left we usually blow out online, and this year is no different. We have a surplus of used electric guitars, that need to go for some early spring cleaning, to make room and way for the new 2019 models. We have about 20 guitars in total (please check our other listings) that need to go, and all of them will vary in brand and condition. Assume, unless noted, that these will need completely gone over. Some of these are ready to go, some need a little help. These might be good for a great deal on parts, a new trio of addition to your collection, or a great opportunity to clean up/set up/fix up, and resell for a nice profit! The choice is up to you! All are sold as-is, with no warranty. Starcaster - A nice cleaning and light setup will go a long way with this, to bring this up to excellent beginner guitar! As it sits now, it plays pretty well, it just has old strings. The pickups are good, pots are just a little tight, but only a light scratch here and there. This should be a great specimen. Crate - A nice cleaning will make this look a lot better. Out of the 3, this has the most bumps and bruises. While they might buff out if you're determined, it certainly has a nice broken in feel and look. Looks like there's some minor rusting on the hardware, neck and frets needs a nice cleaning, but after a deep clean, strings, and setup, this should be ready to go. Pickups work, some light scratching in the electronics, might just need some contact cleaner. Great potential with this one! Silvertone - Overall this is in good condition, and like the others, will benefit from a new set of strings, nice cleaning, and a setup. The neck pickup looks like the bass side has dropped in, but the spring is still there as well as the screw, so I think the screw just needs to be wound back into the pickup. While the 3 way switch is working, it has been broken off, so replacing it would probably be a good idea.", "ItemID": "323716842593", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T21:38:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-01T21:29:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lot-3-Crate-Starcaster-Silvertone-Electric-Strat-KISS-Paul-Stanley-Guitars-/323716842593", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Erie, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3237168425938080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gRQAAOSwGEJceaKx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nA8AAOSwctdceaK1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vJgAAOSwIP9ceaK5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ycAAAOSw~lRceaK8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DWAAAOSwcGtceaLA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rmgAAOSwkNFceaLE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tSkAAOSw8yxceaLI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FeQAAOSwBRlceaLL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fIwAAOSwF7dceaLP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MDwAAOSwUuNceaLS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8TUAAOSweaFceaLW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "16508", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "coolmusicstore", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2104, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Lot of 3 Crate Starcaster Silvertone Electric Strat /KISS Paul Stanley Guitars!", "HitCount": 1, "Subtitle": "Multiple Listings of 3 Guitar Lots for Sale!", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1454517", "StoreName": "COOLMUSICSTORE"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
