{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1989 750XL Cherry Sunburst Flame Maple Top over Mahogany body, Quartersewn maple set neck. Most of you know what this is so here are the specifics\u2014this guitar is another from my private collection\u2014 basically unplayed. The story goes like this \u2014 it\u2019s 1989 and this guitar was purchased new and immediately at the guitar shop an emg was installed before the guitar went home...(yes this was kind of the thing back then)...so then the guitar sits in the case for almost 30 years and here we are today. The photos describe the guitar condition and there really is no wear of any meaningful substance anywhere that I can see on this example. A few handling marks but not even noticeable even in good light. The jumbo frets are virtually smooth even at the chord locations. A true pristine example of extraordinary craftsmanship from a bygone era. Comes with a g and g style fitted case, Original warranty card/hang tag, original owners manual / schaller tremolo instructions, truss rod key, Jackson J80 pickup originally removed. As these don\u2019t come around in this basically unplayed condition very often if ever \u2014serious consideration will be given to packing and shipping properly. Ships to USA lower 48 states only. Please ask any questions before bidding. Thanks for looking and check back for other listings coming soon.", "ItemID": "163401951615", "EndTime": "2018-11-29T21:09:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-28T05:32:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Charvel-Jackson-750XL-Archtop-Soloist-750-XL-Cherry-Sunburst-Flame-Maple-Top-/163401951615", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Newport Beach, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634019516158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wpgAAOSw0~pb9Ovy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/itIAAOSwBZxb9Ovy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R7MAAOSw22lb9Ov3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1qkAAOSwVcZb9Ovs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-OcAAOSw29Jb9Ovt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MLoAAOSwt0db9Ovv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~9QAAOSwaPNb9Ovv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cnAAAOSwEJZb9Ovx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/H-0AAOSwl7db9Ov0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vFQAAOSw5iRb9Ov2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y4UAAOSwkXFb9Ov3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ImQAAOSwHu5b9Ov4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92660", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bjallstate1969", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 349, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1475.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1475.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "j***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Charvel Jackson 750XL Archtop Soloist 750 XL Cherry Sunburst Flame Maple Top", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Charvel"]}]}, "HitCount": 111, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
