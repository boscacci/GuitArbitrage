{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Professional grade 2017 Gibson USA LE (Limited Edition) SG Standard in rare Pelham Blue with Maestro Vibrola. Comes with original premium case and case candy, and awesome guitar utility \u201cSwiss\u201d tool kit. The SG is one of Gibson\u2019s most popular instruments, and given Gibson\u2019s long and storied history, that\u2019s really saying something. Since its inauspicious start in 1961 as a temporary replacement for the Les Paul, the SG has become a favorite of many iconic guitarists. Angus Young, Tony Iommi, Pete Townsend, Frank Zappa, and Derek Trucks have all chosen the SG to convey their artistry at some point in their careers (many exclusively), and it\u2019s even the source of Eric Clapton\u2019s legendary \u201cWoman Tone\u201d from his Cream era. Gibson\u2019s SG flagship, the Standard, is now available in a truly stunning Pelham Blue! This is a Limited Edition Exclusive Run available from American Musical Supply!
