I switched out the stock P90's for some hot Cream colored\u00a0 gold foil P90's,about 9k-neck,10k-bridge. Guitar is in excellent used condition,only very mild surface scratches.\u00a0I traded out the\u00a0closed back tuners\u00a0with some nice Grover style tuners.You can still see some of the holes on the back of the headstock from the old cheapie tuners.\u00a0 I\u00a0 upgraded the stock tone capacitor with a nice .015uf mylar film capacitor. Sounded very full on clean tones and growled like a junk yard dog once I added some gain. I also traded out the speed knobs for\u00a0some more vintage looking black\u00a0 knobs, and cream three way switch tip to get that vintage look I was going for. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great.
