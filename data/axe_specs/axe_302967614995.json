{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is my Squier Stagemaster V4. This is a quality guitar made under the Squier banner--neck through, alder, rosewood fingerboard, neck is straight as an arrow, guitar is heavy as a Les Paul, Licensed Floyd Rose, two powerful humbuckers, all black hardware. I am very impressed by this guitar as it is solid as a rock and plays great. I am told that this guitar was made to compete with guitars that had a much higher price point at the time, and I believe it. This is just an excellent guitar and a player. I'm selling it to finance another purchase so get it while you can. This is in excellent condition, it is used, but it doesn't look to have been used much--more like it has been in a closet for 18 years. The Korean Stagemaster is in demand and now that I've had this one for awhile i can understand why. Get it while you can!", "ItemID": "302967614995", "EndTime": "2018-11-27T01:29:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-22T01:29:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Squier-Stagemaster-Neck-Thru-Korea-/302967614995", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Columbus, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3029676149958080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/50wAAOSwXitb9fj-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZkgAAOSwcT5b9fk1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IkUAAOSwfcNb9flx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qpkAAOSwTDpb9fn6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MYEAAOSws99b9fog/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rIMAAOSwW0Vb9fsC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RmUAAOSwsJBb9fsU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QaMAAOSwZ3pb9fs~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WA4AAOSwZs1b9ftf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aNYAAOSwcT5b9fuA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oQkAAOSwDPNb9fu-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/buQAAOSwiwZb9fvZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "43207", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pam8260", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 646, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 249.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 249.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 312}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Squier Stagemaster Neck Thru Korea", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 126, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 251.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
