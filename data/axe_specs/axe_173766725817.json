{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Previously owned 40+ years old Vintage Fender Stratocaster 1978 USA Black Electric Guitar comes with a Hard Case. Okay... I wish I could tell you more specifics about this guitar however, I am not a guitar guy or musician. Based on a little online research, the serial number claims it was manufactured Between 1977-78. In addition, I am not the original owner of the Fender guitar so I don't know the history of it. There are various surface imperfections, scratches, small nicks. Please examine the guitar body and zoom in on the detailed photos we provided. Ebay only allows 12 so we attempted to take the correct angles. There may be additional blemishes, dings and scratches but nothing major. This item has been tested and working... But will need a set-up by a professional upon receiving, such as a tuned up, tightened, cleaned, and or adjusted to your liking. (Stand or displays not included) It's not as bad as it seems, I just want anyone who buys it to be aware this is a vintage guitar and been used. It may not.. could be to your liking right of the go, but just in case.... It has been sitting in its case these past 3 years unplayed in a non smoking, climate controlled room. .99 Cent No Reserve Auction Uptown Pawn dba.
