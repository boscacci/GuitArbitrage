{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Serial # 9306022 GUITAR WILL COME STRUNG WITH BRAND NEW ERNIE BALL SLINKY\u2019S!!! These are rare guitars to find, especially with the Steve Stevens signature printed on the headstock!! Only made from 1993 to 96 and I haven't seen many.In fact I think quantities of this guitar are less then 100 made because they were put together by hand and from speaking to older workers that came from the original Chicago shop and now are owned by US Music Corp have told me that there were not a lot of those guitars made ,you see more Import SS40's guitars then the USA made models. Condition I would put from 1 to 10 at a 7 just because is not absolutely mint ,so I would put at excellent. It does not have the locks for the locking nut or tremolo arm. Also has some lacquer scratches swirls, and a few small nicks. No Fret Wear at all ! These are amazing guitars and all built based of the one of Steve's favorite guitar ,his 80's Charvel given to him by Grover Jackson. Body is same size and neck is thicker then a Charvel ,more like a EVH Ernie Ball profile rubbed oil neck satin neck feel. Quarter Saw maple one piece hard rock maple 6150 frets ,abalone dot markers,front adjust truss rod access thru with P bass adjustment Allen rod style. One of the few to leave the factory with real flat mount floyd rose setup, and Grover tuners! Stock TB4's JB but fatter tone really nice tone ,you can play any style of music on this guitar ,very versatile 3 way ,mid position sounds like out of phase strat bluesy sound ! Body is made out of poplar one of the best and fattest toned woods around! Original German Schaller Floyd Rose,low action, and a beautiful guitar overall. If you ever wanted a strat guitar that sounded like a Les Paul ,this is definitely it !!! Comes with Original molded Washburn case!", "ItemID": "123543280427", "EndTime": "2018-12-14T15:17:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T23:32:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Washburn-Steve-Stevens-Signature-SS80-Electric-Guitar-Hard-Shell-Case-/123543280427", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Seminole, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235432804278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rMIAAOSwZs1cEuvU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7BkAAOSwM8RcEuvc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QR8AAOSwzcNcEuvX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NH0AAOSwEONcEuvW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RhQAAOSwVRBcEuvf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HzUAAOSwzqtcEuvg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tnAAAOSwPYRcEuvZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TCAAAOSwFs1cEuvb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ukkAAOSwIKNcEuvT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vdsAAOSwLNxcEuvd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QPQAAOSwHEZcEuvR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33772", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bassgod246", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 140, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 850.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 257}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Washburn Steve Stevens Signature SS80 Electric Guitar With Hard Shell Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Washburn"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Ss80"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 59, "Subtitle": "Seymour Duncan JB Humbucker Pickups", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 860.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
