{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Killing me to sell my girl but I must. Got her back in 2014 and really never got to play her. Shes been on the stand, in the bag or on my wall stand most of the time as you can see by her condition. Rarely played and never gigged with. Never left this house actually. Stock humbucker was replaced with a seymour Duncan but Im not sure what model. I had a tech friend do that a long time ago and I dont have any documents on it. She comes with a stand, strap and gig bag. She could probably use a set up and if I remember the high E was a little twangy. Nothing horrible or deal breaking at all, I just like to disclose all I know about my items. Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions! Take good care of her. All I have left is a Classical now. boo hoo. lol FEATURES Mahogany bodyMaple neck with \u0153modern C\u009d profile9.5\u009d-radius rosewood fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets Seymour Duncan Humbucking bridge pickupsFive-way switchingThree-ply black pickguard and black plastic control knobsTwo-point synchronized tremolo bridge with block saddles SPECIFICATIONS Series: Modern PlayerBody Shape: StratocasterBody Material: MahoganyBody Finish: Gloss PolyesterNeck: Maple, Modern \"C\" ShapeNeck Finish: Gloss PolyesterString Nut: Synthetic Bone, 1.650\" (42 mm)Fingerboard: Rosewood, 9.5\" (241 mm) RadiusFrets: 22 Medium JumboPosition Inlays: White DotScale Length: 25.5\" (648 mm)Hardware: ChromeBridge: 2-Point Synchronized Tremolo with Block SaddlesTuning Machines: Vintage-StyleStrings: Fender USA 250R NPS, (.010-.046 Gauges)Pickup Configuration: H/S/HPickups: Modern Player Humbucking (Bridge and Neck) Modern Player Single-Coil Strat (Middle)Pickup Switching: 5-Position Blade: Position 1.
