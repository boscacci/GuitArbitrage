{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a rare 1991-1992 Fender Stratocaster Plus in RARE Black Pearl Burst. When I found her, I wasn't sure what she was...so...I did a deep dive on Google and did my research. What I found out is that these Strat Plus guitars are gems that are fairly unique thanks to the LACE sensor pickups w/TBX tone control, Wilkinson nut and locking tuners.This is an amazing sounding and playing Strat. The LACE sensor pickups sound fantastic, and give almost a humber bucker fullness to the sound without sacrificing any of that typical Strat single coil tone. The TBX control essentially lets you have more control over the bass and treble levels, whereas \"standard\" Strats only let you boost the treble. It has a Wilkinson nut and Schaller locking tuners in matte...both work great and keep this baby in tune through thick and thin. Modern C shape neck is comfortable and straight, and the maple fretboard is clean and fast ...she plays as good as she looks.So, what keeps her from being like new? I've taken pics of all her flaws:Light fret dimples on 2nd and 3rd fretLight buckle rash on the backHanging marks under the headstockMissing the hipshot tremolo setter typically found in the rear cavityThere are a couple other light imperfections here and there, but honestly they were too tough capture on camera. All and all, is in very good to excellent shape. Please don't hesitate to ask me questions...happy to answer them. This is a unique guitar that will make someone very happy. She comes in the Fender hard case shown.Merry Christmas!", "ItemID": "264085742643", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T23:35:27.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-12T23:26:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1991-1992-Fender-Stratocaster-Plus-Black-Pearl-Burst-Made-USA-/264085742643", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Norman, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640857426438080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/8AYAAOSwPYRcEZhh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/2dUAAOSw22FcEZhl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/5bUAAOSwUP5cEZhp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/d94AAOSwQ9lcEZhu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/Ar8AAOSwIAJcEZhx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/~8MAAOSw3T5cEZh1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/1YUAAOSwFAtcEZh8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/AooAAOSwI9FcEZiB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/TfkAAOSwqKNcEZiF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/R~sAAOSwcttcEZiK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/71EAAOSwWrNcEZiO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/L1EAAOSwCNlcEZiT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "73071", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "eglantyne", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2883, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 899.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 899.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 328}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1991-1992 Fender Stratocaster Plus in Black Pearl Burst Made in USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1991"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Plus"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black Pearl Burst"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 570, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=12325787", "StoreName": "Claire&#39;s Closet Corner"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very good used condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
