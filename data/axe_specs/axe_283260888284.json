{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction is my Brian Moore i2000 Series i2.13. From 2002 to 2012 I played Brian Moore Guitars exclusively. This was a backup. It saw studio time and a few shows. It is in excellent condition. No major dings or even scratches. Little fret wear. The original Brian Moore hardshell case was never taken on the road and is excellent. A few scuffs and minor dings and perfect on the inside. All latches and the handle are perfect. Dunlop gold Straplocks with the strap pieces included. Original paperwork desribing all controls and original wrenches included. Original strap buttons included. Stereo cable included. If you are checking this guitar out, I'm sure you are familiar with all the awesome features. Mahogany body with maple top, and the pattern on this one is outstanding. Sperzel locking tuners. The gold hardware only has minor pitting. Seymour Duncan JB in the bridge and '59 up front, both with coil tapping. Piezo pickup in the bridge for awesome acoustic sounds. And, of course, a 13-pin output to plug directly into the sythesizer of your choice. (I used Roland with excellent results, my favorite still being the GR-33.) In the pictures I included the 13-pin jack from my well-used i8.13. This is what this jack looks like after years and years of shows and use. See how clean the i2.13 is. I also moved the rear strap button to the traditional Les Paul type location, which I was used to. Plus you don't have to reverse the strap piece and thus the strap will work for all your other guitars. Can easily, of course, be moved back to the original location. You would be hard pressed to find another used piece in this condition. And at this price.This guitar easily hangs with all my Les Pauls, and I actually prefer the neck taper of the Brian Moore. Extremely comfortable to play. If you've never played with electric distortion or clean sounds along with acoustic, you will be in for a treat. Add some Hammond B3 from a synth and oh, my. Beyong huge, and no keyboard player to pay and take up half the stage! Continental US shipping only. Check my feedback and bid with total, 100% confidence. Ebayer since 2000. Thanks for checking out my auction and hope to be shipping this beauty to you!", "ItemID": "283260888284", "EndTime": "2018-11-21T23:15:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-14T23:15:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Brian-Moore-iGuitar-i2000-i2-13-Sunburst-13-pin-Hardshell-Case-Excellent-/283260888284", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Austin, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832608882848080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HaUAAOSwdPBbtUai/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uaQAAOSwg65btUbb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/64AAAOSwiqdbtUbc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dzUAAOSwVx5btUbc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7MUAAOSwwb1btUb3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7V4AAOSwjCVbtUb3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-ykAAOSwuZpbtUb3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/amkAAOSw3S5btUb3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vP8AAOSwT0pbtUcz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H-kAAOSwKA5btUcz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e~gAAOSwe~BbtUbd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QEoAAOSwDcZbtUcy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "78727", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hamer_dog", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 557, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Brian Moore iGuitar i2000 i2.13 Sunburst 13-pin Hardshell Case Excellent\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Brian Moore"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["i2.13"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 67, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 809.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
