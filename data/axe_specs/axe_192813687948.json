Where standard necks may show aging defects from temperature and moisture changes throughout the years, the 3 piece neck will stay nice and straight for a lifetime of playability.Seymour Duncan JB (SH-4)/Sustainiac\u00ae PickupsBridge: The worlds most popular humbucker. Provides slammin output while retaining singing highs, aggressive harmonics, and just the right blend of sustain and distortion. Goes from sweet warm tones to raw rock n roll. Sustainiac\u00ae: This Driver/Pickup produces beautiful Humbucker tones when Sustain switch is off, and works as the Sustainiac Driver when switched On. The Sustainiac Driver creates an infinite feedback sustain of string vibrations by electromagnetic feedback. Rosewood Fingerboard The most common fretboard, Rosewood is naturally oily, and works well for any surface that sees frequent human contact. The sound is richer in fundamental than Maple because the stray overtones are absorbed into the oily pores.Schecter Locking TunersSchecter Locking Tuners feature a locking screw pin to lock the string into place for greater tuning stability. Details include a 19:1 gear ratio allowing for precise fine tuning adjustments, removable knobs, threaded peghead bushing, and a 10mm diameter peg hole.Set Neck w/Ultra Access ConstructionMahogany Body3-pc Mahogany NeckRosewood Finger Board24X Jumbo FretsGreen Block InlaysBlack Multi-ply BindingSchecter Locking TunersSeymour Duncan JB (SH-4)/Sustainiac\u00ae PickupsVolume/Tone/3-Way Toggle (pickups)/ On-Off Mini Toggle/ 3-Way Normal-Mix-Harmonic Mode Mini Toggle TonePros Tune-O-Matic Bridge w/String-Thru-Body 26.5\" ScaleBlack Chrome HardwareB/E/A/D/F#/B TuningCase Not IncludedOrder your Schecter Kenny Hickey Signature C-1 EX Electric Guitar from Sam Ash Direct today with the security of our 45/60 day return/price protection policy.
