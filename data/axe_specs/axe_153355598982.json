{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2007 Paul Reed Smith Santana III in beautiful Violin Amber Burst finish with a highly flamed, gorgeous 10 top. Overall the guitar is in very good condition for its age...there are just a couple of small dings in the finish, one on the upper horn and one on the top edge by the lower strap button. There is also a small scratch on the back of the neck near the heel, and some minor fret wear that does not affect playability. A little tarnish on the pickup covers and light normal playing wear, but otherwise very clean. This is a Maryland-made PRS, not an import!The original strap buttons have been replaced with Dunlop Strap Locks, and I replaced the original speed knobs with the newer amber lamp shades. Also, I misplaced the high E string saddle intonation screw and spring, so I replaced them with genuine PRS parts. I had to purchase an entire set, but I only installed the parts I needed. The remaining parts from the set will be included, should you choose to replace the original parts. Original knobs and strap buttons are also included, along with the Dunlop strap hardware and original tremolo arm.Guitar will ship in the original hardshell case, which is in excellent condition. A few light marks on the outside but immaculate inside and all case hardware is in perfect working order. No case candy. The guitar weighs just over 9 lbs but is very well balanced and plays great. All electronics are original, and this guitar features a coil tap on the tone knob. Other features include locking tuners, solid mahogany body with carved maple top, mahogany neck with 24 frets on a 24.5\" scale fretboard with abalone bird inlays.FREE SHIPPING from NJ to anywhere in the lower 48 states. I will ship to AK, HI and PR for a slight upcharge. Sorry, no overseas or international shipping and no P.O. Boxes. Will consider local pickup or delivery in the South Jersey/Philly area. All sales final.
