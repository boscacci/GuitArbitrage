This 2016 model hails from Memphis and gives you best of both the Les Paul and 335 worlds in a slick package with all the fixin's. The center-block semi-hollow designs gives the humbucking pickups a breathe of new life, and with Maple/Poplar/Maple construction this bad boy barely cracks 6 pounds on our digital scale.

If you've read any of our humbucker reviews we've come to the conclusion that the best sounding sets are wound to a mild resistance and use fairly weak magnets. Of course with all of the different musical styles that humbuckers serve this is not a universal truth. However if you want pure clean power, this is a tried and true recipe. So when we found that this Les Paul has special Memphis pickups wound in the mid 7k's with Alnico III and II magnets, it explained why this thing had so much mojo. The neck pickup comes in at around 7.5k, the bridge at a slightly amped 7.9k and both are scatter wound with 42 gauge wire. The magnet in the neck is a little stronger than the bridge which gives you the perfect balance of warmth and articulation no matter where you are on the selector switch. Combine that with a 6 pound semi-hollow body and we dare say you've perfected the lightweight Les Paul. This Gibson ES Les Paul is completely 100% original with Memphis Certificate. The guitar is in excellent condition and comes ready to do some serious work. There is not a lot we can say about this guitar: Chances are if you are looking at it, you know what it's all about. While it's not a vintage piece, the Memphis creations are certainly something to behold in modern Gibson production.Orders received by 12:00EST will be shipped the next day.
