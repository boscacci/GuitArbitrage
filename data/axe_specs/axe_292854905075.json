{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1993 Gibson ES-135. A great playing and sounding Gibson Semi-Hollow for a nice price. The neck has a chunky but not too fat profile that feels great in your palm. It is still straight and plays great with a tight, smooth action in every position. Original P-100 Pickups are super warm, punchy and focused. From deep, round, woody lows to bright jangly trebles this workhorse can handle nearly any gig or genre. Excellent playing condition with signs of normal, honest cosmetic wear. There is some light belt buckle wear and other signs of regular use when examined closely. You can tell it's been played but it is certainly ready for more. Comes with the original hard shell case. Guitar is exactly as pictured.
