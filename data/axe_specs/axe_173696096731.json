{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hi, I'm selling part of my guitar collection to help a family member with medical expenses. Please don't buy if you have any reservations- any set back will directly affect my family. Thank you.This is my Parker Fly post-refined in excellent condition. No dings, no dents, no buckle rash, no repairs, no issues. It plays excellent, all electronics work AOK, it includes factory hard case, whammy bar, adjustment tools, and stereo cable. Electric and acoustic sounds are awesome. You will only see very very faint polishing scratches, tiny relief spot in the back under the finish (I'm guessing it's from the factory because there is not touch up), a couple of very light scratches around the upper horn guitar strap button (I'm thinking from a strap rubbing against it), and that's it pretty much it. It really is in excellent shape unlike some other that say \"excellent\" but have nicks, dents, scratches, etc. Set up with super low action, neck is straight. I'll add more pics in the next day or two. I added a tone and volume knobs with florescent numbers - inspired by Guthrie Govan's Charvel and 3 tiny removable red stickers as pointers. The knobs are top notch and expensive. I will include the originals.It's currently set up with 9's and I will include a 10 gauge spring.I've been playing for 26 years and take outmost care of my guitars-this guitar comes from a very good home/collection as you can see in the last picture. Sale is final since. Please ask questions before buying.
