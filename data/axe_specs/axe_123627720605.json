{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1990\u2019S IBANEZ RX20 ELECTRIC GUITAR, 2 HUMBUCKERS, SHERWOOD GREEN, GREAT STARTER, LIGHT The RX20 is a solid body electric guitar introduced by Ibanez in 1994. It is part of the entry level RX series. It was among the most affordable models offered. The RX20 features a hardwood body bolted to a maple neck with a 22-fret maple fingerboard with dot position markers. Components include a synchronized tremolo bridge and dual Ibanez Powersound humbucking pickups. This 1990\u2019s Ibanez RX20 Electric Guitar is a used item in VG condition. This guitar is in generally good shape and would be a great starter for anyone. Lightweight and easy to work with, it\u2019s a decent player that was recently set-up and ready to go. You will find some pick marks and minor scratches on the body, but the biggest concern is the mark you see pictured form the back of the guitar. This doesn\u2019t break the surface yet it a decent mark that wraps up towards the upper edge of the body. Electronics works as they should. You will receive this item well-packed but without a tremolo bar, case, gig bag, the original packaging or paperwork. Please contact this seller for additional information.
