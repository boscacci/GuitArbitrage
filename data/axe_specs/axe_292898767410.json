{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a Route 101 Solimar Guitar. It\u2019s in excellent condition and comes with a hard shell case. Route 101 was a custom guitar maker in California, but is no longer in business. They assembled guitars in CA and their guitars were built to order with many available options.This one has a maple neck, heavier fret wire, three single-coil pickups, and a seven-way selector switch. In my opinion, this is the only guitar you will find at this kind of price with a high-quality maple neck and important features like a shielded control cavity. Their old website appears to still be partially active:http://www.route101guitars.com/ These guitars were available online only during the early 2000\u2019s. You could order your guitar with various features. Most finished guitars were around 400 dollars after adding options and the hard shell case. The body is made from Kapere, which is another name for Spanish Cedar. It\u2019s a nice and light wood and has a really nice tone. There is no visible wear on the fingerboard, the frets are in great shape. I\u2019ve personally gotten a really nice early Carlos Santana tone with this guitar, similar to what you hear on songs like Samba Pa Ti, using a Marshall JCM2000.", "ItemID": "292898767410", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T15:58:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T15:58:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Route-101-Solimar-Stratocaster-Style-Electric-Guitar-/292898767410", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Groton, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928987674108080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QXUAAOSw-iZb-FkH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2ZcAAOSwVCpb-FkK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ctYAAOSwmE9b-FkH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bUkAAOSw-4Jb-F-V/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/smgAAOSwq2xb-F-h/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/20AAAOSw1Ihb-F-p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XCoAAOSw19db-F-z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yooAAOSw-QBb-F-6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bmQAAOSwPmVb-F~A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oIgAAOSw2-pb-F~D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yDwAAOSwAQVb-F~J/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mxEAAOSw5qdb-FkL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "01450", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "guitar_steve", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 130, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 130.29, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 130.29, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 918}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Route 101 Solimar Stratocaster Style Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Kapere"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Route 100 Solimar"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 95, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 132.79, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
