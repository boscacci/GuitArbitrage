{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Very nice Jackson stars with EMG plug n play active pickups the neck is purely amazing! These are Jacksons only available in Japan . Some other company holds the name Jackson in Japan so they had to put Stars behind it. But make no mistake about it, they are Jacksons... The quality is on line with the USA made ones. Maybe a little behind but not much. They are made for the Japan market, not the US. Guitar looks new neck plays very fast. Same thing with Grover Jackson. For the Japanese market only. But the Stars line is further up the food chain than Grover Jackson... JACKSONS made in Japan under the Jackson stars name are like the difference between a Ibanez RG550 and a Jem. Both made in the same factory, but differ quality wise. More time and better parts go into the Stars then the Jackson Imports. But don't get me wrong, a lot of the MIJ Jacksons are solid instruments... Alder Body w/ Red Veneer Maple Bolt-On Neck Rosewood Fretboard with Dot Inlays Licensed Floyd Rose Two EMG active Humbucker Pickups One Volume One Tone Three Way Switch Hard shell case case include reviews What a neck wow. This thing plays amazing. When I have some time I'll take some pics and put them up. This feels like the USA jacksons that I have played. Absolutley amazing. Over all this guitar is worth what I paid and then some. It is fine instrument. It works so well for hard rock, soft rock, rock, metal, post hardcore, hardcore and death metal. All in all if you play rock or metal I highly recommend this guitar.", "ItemID": "323600053168", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T23:05:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T23:05:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-Stars-case-SUPER-NICE-Made-Japan-EMG-active-pickups-USA-rare-/323600053168", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236000531688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/oMgAAOSw6aJa25HR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/wNYAAOSwpN1a25RP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/LtgAAOSwxT9a25RZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/2OkAAOSw1fha25Rw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/6NcAAOSwE2da25SE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/xh4AAOSwBMRa25SQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/~DEAAOSwHjta25uA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/C5QAAOSwkela25uQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/0xoAAOSwhr5a25uf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/T9YAAOSwG4xa25vY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/GDkAAOSwOhNa26T-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/3vsAAOSwE3ha26VL/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "74129", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rothvanberg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 527, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 287}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson Stars /case SUPER NICE Made in Japan EMG active pickups USA rare", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson Stars"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["5 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["DK2M Dinky"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 35, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
