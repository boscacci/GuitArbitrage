Ibanez - RG560 This is an Ibanez RG560 electric guitar. It was made in Japan in 1987, and the serial is F731XXX. It has been well loved and played throughout the years. It's missing the back plate, the and the hardware has been worn down in some areas/has scratching. Minus some light surface scratching, and a small chip, the body looks pretty good. The previous owner had this guitar professionally re-finished, even though it's not original, it's quite beautiful. The pickups are not original. The frets have been dressed, but there's no pitting, they still function fine. It comes with the original hardshell case.
