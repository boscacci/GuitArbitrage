{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1986 Fender Contemporary Stratocaster Deluxe model 27-5800. Good condition. I installed a brand new Seymour Duncan TB-4 Jeff Beck humbucker in the bridge and a Seymour Duncan SH-1N '59 Model humbucker in the neck as well as a custom made pickguard to fit traditional sized humbuckers. This guitar originally had soap bar sized humbuckers. There is a switch for coil splitting the humbuckers. 1 volume and 1 tone control. This is not wired for TBX tone control any longer. The coil split switch, volume pot, and tone pot are new. The 3-way switch and input jack are still the original parts, as well as the sweet \"F\" logo knobs. The electronics sound great and work perfectly. The frets have a lot of life; minimal wear. The tremolo works as it should. Along with the guitar I'll ship the original pickguard (small section nearest the bridge had broken off), the volume and TBX tone pots, coil-split switch, and the original neck pickup (the guitar didn't have the bridge pickup when I got it) The whammy bar is not original to this guitar; I bought that a week ago. Please see photos for physical condition. It seems to be missing the height adjustment(?) screw for the d string saddle. So you'll need to replace that. The nut looks like it should be adjusted but I haven't figured it out and do not know if it adjusts or just needs to be replaced. The lock on the nut works perfectly. I bought this guitar a few weeks ago to get it fixed up and make it my main axe. I've already put about $250 or so into it, but it's a little too complex for my brain and I lack the knowledge of these Fender Contemporary Stratocasters to finish what I started. I have 3 other Strats, so I'm just going to sell this one as is and move on to the next project. Please bid with the mindset that it will need a little more work to get it playing the way you'd like. At the very least, the guitar will need set up. Thank you for looking!", "ItemID": "163393397434", "EndTime": "2018-12-01T04:45:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-24T04:45:05.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Contemporary-Stratocaster-Deluxe-1986-Made-Japan-MIJ-27-5800-/163393397434", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Vancouver, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633933974348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/44gAAOSwc6Zb-NUp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/POYAAOSwcqxb-NUu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nDEAAOSw3LVb-NUw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EFQAAOSwQwFb-NUr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DnEAAOSwEcxb-NUs/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M9AAAOSwZltb-NUz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CCoAAOSwHHRb-NU2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Fe0AAOSwPrtb-NU7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gCEAAOSwjlVb-NUn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JbwAAOSwu9Jb-NUx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XzgAAOSwwPdb-NU0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/M3wAAOSwlINb-NUq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98663", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "shad0612", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 80, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 412.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 412.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 177}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Contemporary Stratocaster Deluxe 1986 Made in Japan MIJ 27-5800", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Contemporary Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 471, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 417.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
