{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello, This listing is for one loaded, gorgeous 6 string Ernie Ball Music Man John Petrucci Majesty in Sapphire Blue. John & Music Man have created something special with the Majesty. This axe is literally a machine. THE most comfortable,ergonomically perfect guitar I've encountered in 4 decades. It hugs literally hugs your body and sits so well balanced in playing position. Playing at the 24th fret is incredible. My hand never even hits the lower cutaway! Stainless steel frets that'll never wear out,a non locking,no nonsense SMOOTH tremolo you can bury and it'll return to perfect zero. Gorgeous mirror inlays,rock solid locking tuners,killer tone wood combination(mahogany,basswood,maple,ebony fingerboard)and no big bulky neck heel so you can rip licks & chord way up the neck comfortably. The electronics are awesome! 2 perfectly balanced magnetic illuminator humbuckers and the bridge Piezos that deliver beautiful acoustic tone and can be used alone or blended with the humbuckers. The volume,tone & piezoelectric control knobs are all push/push plunger types. The official performance will all be included with the specs below,in my experiemce... push the volume knob and you're in overdrive heaven,like kicking in a stomp box . Push the tone knob and you're splitting the coil or adding a capacitor,the piezo push/push knob changes your input from mono to stereo. I'm constantly using the preamp on the volume knob and the tonal variance of the tone knob. I love pedals,but its killer to get the dirt right from the guitar. I've only been able to scratch the surface. The case is excellent. Built and molded to fit this guitar like a glove. Has a key lock and solid hinges. It would stand up to shipping as is. Beautiful way to protect this gorgeous The Majesty has been set up recently & plays like a dream. Comes with the whammy bar. ,I'm including a set of Elixir Polyweb 9-42 strings, EBMM cleaning wipes and an array of cool picks of different shapes and thickness because finding the right pick is awesome.
