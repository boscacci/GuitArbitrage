{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This ad is for a 2017 Godin ACS SA Nylon Classical Electric Guitar. One of the most versatile guitars in the world; you can play any kind of music, from Rock, to Classical, to Country, to Gospel,....No limit! You can also plug into your synthesizer & \"create\" any form of music known to man. This is the absolute easiest to play guitar ever built!!! The nut is .715\" which is about the same as your standard \"steel string\" guitar; making it easy to cross over to classical. This one was bought for a recording studio & never really used. It was was played a few times , but only for a few minutes; it is practically \"unplayed\". Having been played, I will not call it mint, but it is as close to mint as possible. You will not be disappointed with this one; it's like getting a new guitar at a used price. The \"protective plastic\" is still in place on all the access covers. The MSRP on these is $1450, (some discount online stores sell them for around $1200.) but you can own this one in \"near new\" condition for a fraction of that price.
