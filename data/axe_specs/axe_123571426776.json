{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2016 FENDER CUSTOM SHOP 52 TELECASTER, ORANGE SPARKLE, HEAVY RELIC, TWEED CASE, ALL CANDY An exceptionally fine '52 Heavy Relic Tele reissue in a rare orange sparkle finish. Featuring Fender's heavy relic treatment, this 1952 Telecaster Reissue electric guitar has the look of many years of hard use on the road with nicks, scratches, worn finish, rusty hardware, and aged plastic parts. The premium ash body wood with a worn nitro finish has great tone and is lightweight (7.5 pounds) for playing comfort. The 1-piece, quartersawn maple neck has the distinctive 51 Nocaster U profile neck, 9.5\u201d radius, narrow width, with jumbo height frets. The worn finish on the back for a great, smooth \"played-in\" feel. A traditional maple fingerboard sports black dot inlays, 21 fast medium-jumbo frets and heavy wear. The original spec '51 Nocaster single-coil in the bridge creates all the snap, snarl, and yes, twang you could ever want from a Tele. Grease bucket tone control, just rolls the edge off the highs. Included all original case candy, high end fender leather strap, ashtray/bridge cover, and full, unused Custom Shop tool set! This Fender Custom Shop 52 Telecaster is a used item in close to excellent condition, but how can you judge it when it\u2019s this relic\u2019d! There are no unintentional dings, marks, or issues with this guitar. Electronics work as they should. In marvelous condition with a huge tone. Gorgeous ash body under the superb heavy relic finish; neck shows no marks or concerns. This guitar was recently set-up and gone over so it\u2019s ready to go out of the box. You will receive this item well-packed in its Custom Shop case with the COA and all accessories but without the original packaging. Please contact this seller for additional information.
