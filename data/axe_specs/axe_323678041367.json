{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a used Fender 72 Telecaster Deluxe reissue. I think this is from 2007, which is when I bought it new. These guitars sound great. The humbuckers are awesome and it has the super cool large 70\u2019s headstock. This guitar plays great and sounds great, but has some cosmetic wear. There are chips to the finish along the edge of the body and right behind the neck that can be seen in the pictures. The strap holes have also been moved and included is a Dimarzio strap. There is a crack in the pickguard under the tone knob. When the knobs are on, it\u2019s barely noticeable and it in no way effects the use of the 2 volume or 2 tone knobs. There is a slight indent on the 15th fret by the b string. The high e string tuning peg has been replaced. This also includes a telecaster size SKB hard shell case which has a crack near the handle This guitar plays and sounds great. It has some road wear from traveling with me. If you\u2019re looking for a great playing guitar and are cool with some wear, this is the guitar for you. I hate to see it go but I\u2019m moving and without room. Shipping within the US is $75 and any shipping difference after packing and shipping cost will be refunded. As with all instruments I sell, they are sold as is and should be set up to your liking Please ask any questions before bidding.", "ItemID": "323678041367", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T15:02:05.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-02T22:28:53.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-72-Telecaster-Deluxe-Walnut-W-SKB-Hardshell-Guitar-/323678041367", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bethlehem, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236780413678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6rkAAOSwMYtcVhdU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/V9cAAOSwO-hcVhdS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qh0AAOSw0LhcVhc-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YikAAOSwgfRcVhdJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hdgAAOSwYV5cVhdG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cioAAOSwe7ZcVhdN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pq4AAOSwk9FcVhdQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f-MAAOSwHDdcVhdA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SwoAAOSwsrlcVhdC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GQcAAOSwKXhcVhdL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hbcAAOSwo6NcVhdE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WbsAAOSwyeNcVhdO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "18020", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tweedsuitcase", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2326, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 499.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 318}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender 72 Telecaster Deluxe Walnut W/SKB Hardshell Guitar ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Walnut"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["72 Telecaster Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 444, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["IT"], "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
