The serial number in PRS guitars is in the pickup cavity. You can see it in the photo, it's still there today.I can take a photo of it now, just for reference. The wiring is original. It has the 5 way selector knob and sweet switch.the original knob on the selector switch broke during disassembly of the guitar for painting.I have the original here and will include it The guitar comes with your choice of case. 1. Flight Case.. The most solid case you can get. this will protect the guitar from even the most brutal baggage handler 2. PRS USA case. A recent case, in great condition, not the original from this PRS, but another I own. From the original listing of the guitar:\"One of the Phase 1 locking tuners was damaged and replaced with a single Phase II later in its life. The Brazilian Rosewood fretboard is in great shape and the frets have a good amount of life left, although they do show some minor divoting and moderate flattening. The original sweet switch was damaged and removed at some point as well but has been replaced with an Authentic NOS PRS replacement Sweet Switch. The original volume pot and 5 way Rotary switch are still in tact. The original tremolo back plate and control cavity cover are not pictured but are included as well.\" The last 3 photos are of the guitar before respray. Lollar Lollatrons are awesome pickups. The have been changed from 2 wire into 4 wire split pickups by the master wizard Dave Ulbrick.", "ItemID": "132956062697", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T03:05:14.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-17T05:13:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-electric-guitar-1989-CU-24-make-offer-/132956062697", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Blackburn, VIC", "PaymentMethods": ["MoneyXferAccepted", "PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329560626978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PCYAAOSwSCZbPiKO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XhEAAOSwAuZbPiKU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c~4AAOSwNDZbPiKi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZigAAOSwFvlbPiKn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vD8AAOSw3ItbPiKw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/llwAAOSw-~NbPiK2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wGMAAOSwB0BbPiK8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fjsAAOSwN~ZbpGqo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/okQAAOSw1CBbpGq2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg2OTQ=/z/w5wAAOSw1fdbpHFH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTk1WDE2MDA=/z/xZ0AAOSw0c9bpHGJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFg2NDk=/z/vD4AAOSwbZBbpHGR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "3130", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "notjared", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 412, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1992.06, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2800.0, "CurrencyID": "AUD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***z", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1663}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "Australia", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith electric guitar 1989 CU-24 make an offer!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1989"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 83, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "AU", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Has been resprayed..
