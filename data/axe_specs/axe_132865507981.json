{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1987 Fender '52 Telecaster reissue in near mint condition with only a few light marks on the pickguard. Neck is good and guitar plays and sounds like a Tele should. Played little and never gigged. Practically no fret wear, no dings or scratches and no buckle rash. Includes COA and all original accessories and paperwork. Original sales receipt included. Owned by the band Ohio Express. Will confirm ownership on request. Local pickup is preferred, but will ship. EDIT: We've corrected an error in the original listing having to do with the date of manufacture. This instrument was manufactured in 1987, not 1986 as originally indicated. We also have listed a Gibson 1959 Les Paul reissue that was manufactured in 1986, and must have gotten our wires crossed. COA for the Tele is dated July 25, 1987. Guitar was purchased from Guitar Center in Amherst, Ohio on August 15, 1987. Also, we've received several requests asking us for photos of the neck pocket and neck heel, so we'll address that issue here. We'd rather not remove the neck, so please don't ask. We understand that doing so won't harm the instrument, but it is not our property and we simply don't feel comfortable doing it. Thank you for your understanding.", "ItemID": "132865507981", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T23:43:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-23T14:49:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1987-Fender-52-Telecaster-Reissue-Near-Mint-Recording-Artist-Owned-/132865507981", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Mansfield, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1328655079818080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwNFgxMDAw/z/S9UAAOSwhE9bj~Eb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwNFgxMDAw/z/MPAAAOSwRtNbj~E4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxNTA0/z/EygAAOSwLxpbj~Dy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxNTA0/z/YIkAAOSwBP9bj~D2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxNTA0/z/tccAAOSwSZBbj~EK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwNFgxMDAw/z/SVcAAOSw6W9bj~Fa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwNFgxMDAw/z/TFgAAOSw1SJbj~Fn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxNTA0/z/2bsAAOSwf2pbj~Dj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxNTA0/z/tMYAAOSwSZBbj~Df/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxNTA0/z/W08AAOSwy6lbj~D6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxNTA0/z/yVcAAOSwMHtbj~D-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44904", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "325allyoop", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 610, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 180}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1987 Fender '52 Telecaster Reissue Near Mint Recording Artist Owned", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blonde"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["52 Tele"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 29, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=100736561", "StoreName": "Distressed Goods"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1925.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Near mint.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
