{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a Zakk Wylde Epiphone Les Paul with Buzzsaw paint scheme. This guitar is an original and not a factory second. These are becoming harder and harder to get a hold of these days. This guitar is not new. The eBayer I bought this off of had painted all of the hardware black, even the pickups. All of the hardware has been replaced with brand new chrome pieces to match what it was when it was new. I have replaced the junk painted pickups with an EMG 85/81 configuration. As mentioned above, this guitar is used and does show some wear. There are minor scratches and dings on the backside of the guitar and some clearcoat dulling between the pickups on the front side. Please see pics for details. The finish really isn't in that bad of a condition and could be easily polished up. I just don't have the proper tools to do that. This guitar plays and sounds like a beast! Like it should! Included is a Gig Skinz gig bag. The guitar and bag will ship in a box for protection. This item is sold as is so please feel free to ask questions. The item in the pictures is the one you will receive. Happy bidding and thanks for looking!!
