{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx only,no post office boxes.I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone by Gibson Les Paul Junior with some nice upgrades. The cheapie closed back tuners have been upgrade with some nice Grover style diecast tuners,you can see some of the holes on the back of the headstock left over from the old tuners. Guitar is in great condition, with just mild surface scratches. I replaced the stock pickup with a nice Hot 15k HMV Black/Cream Zebra Invader style 4 wire Humbucker pickup. I also put in a push/pull tone control so that the humbucker can be split into a single coil. Next I upgraded the tone capacitor with a Orange Drop Style capacitor. Sometimes I change the caps and I don't hear a big difference,this time the change was quite noticable. Sounded very full on clean tones and has a nice super nasty growl once you add some gain. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. A classy looking guitar that wants to kick some butt. Please study the pictures to get a better idea of the condition. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
