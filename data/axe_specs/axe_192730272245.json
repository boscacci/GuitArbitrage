{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is this fully serviced Epiphone or Buy It Now! This guitar had one owner and was purchased new. I serviced the guitar as a professionally trained service person. The neck is straight. There are no structural defects, cracks, breaks or repairs. There are some superficial finish cracks inherent with a bolt on model. There is belt buckle rash and scratches and dings in the paint. You can see them in the photographs. Ask all questions before bidding. This is a really nice used Epiphone guitar. I personally set it up with fresh new number 10 Ernie Ball Regular Slinky\u2019s. So you know it\u2019s been checked, it\u2019s been cleaned, it\u2019s been serviced restrung all the electronics work excellent! You get a clean guitar with working electronics nicely set up with regular guage strings. Used Epiphone gig bag (with handles but shoulder strap neatly cut off). Epiphone pick. Free shipping! Ask any and all questions before bidding. Thank you for viewing my auction. Stay tuned for more good stuff for the holidays!", "ItemID": "192730272245", "EndTime": "2018-11-30T00:36:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-20T00:36:50.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-Epiphone-Les-Paul-Special-II-Electric-Guitar-/192730272245", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927302722458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qWoAAOSwRDpb81RV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5scAAOSwzhZb81RX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PtQAAOSwjMtb81RZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/36EAAOSwJ~xb81Ra/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/C9sAAOSwaepb81Re/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PcEAAOSw175b81Rc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "18657", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dkuffa", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 66, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 115.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 115.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 108}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Used Epiphone Les Paul Special II Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Special II"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["Gig Bag and Pick"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Multicolor"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut", "Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["ENJRWHCH1"]}]}, "HitCount": 378, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 117.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78667697", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
