{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "It's time once again for my annual holiday guitar sale. Lot's of people look forward to this each year, so here we go. You are looking at an American made G&L Legacy USA Stratocaster style electric guitar, that was by the famous Leo Fender at his offshoot company Guitars by Leo. This is a pretty rare model you don't see around often. Color is jet black with a white tortoise shell pick guard and chrome hardware. This gorgeous guitar looks unplayed, but has a few handling marks on the body. A hard shell TKL case will be included, to help protect during shipping. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a cool and collectible guitar, that is sure to keep going up in value. Each year I sell off the high end guitars that we have acquired at our pawn shop during the year, and they have been sold to almost every country in the world. We only sell quality products, and our feedback will back that up. All will be sold on a no reserve basis, and no auctions will be closed early or with a buy it now, so bid to buy. Thanks for looking, and please check out my other auctions too.", "ItemID": "183595093009", "EndTime": "2018-12-26T23:40:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T23:40:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/G-L-Legacy-Guitars-Leo-USA-made-stratocaster-style-guitar-w-hard-shell-case-/183595093009", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Riverside, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835950930098080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/~WIAAOSwmT1cGtVr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/dGIAAOSwl1FcGtVo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/-RcAAOSwusdcGtVZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/ZO0AAOSwiOZcGtVj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/C2AAAOSwjfdcGtVo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/4v0AAOSwTQNcGtWA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/ImMAAOSwWH1cGtVN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/bcQAAOSwAopcGtWS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/Eb4AAOSwC45cGtVf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/0dsAAOSw651cGtVc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/0UEAAOSw5qdcGtVX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/GZMAAOSwXMxcGtVx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92506", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "inlandjandl", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 691, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 31, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 563.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 563.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 51}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "G&L Legacy Guitars by Leo USA made stratocaster style guitar w/hard shell case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["G&L"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Legacy"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 757, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 573.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
