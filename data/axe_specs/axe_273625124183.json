{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2003 Tom Anderson Drop Top Classic Tiger Eye w/ OHSC 2003 Tom Anderson Drop Top Classic Tiger Eye w/ OHSC Tom Anderson and his small team of highly skilled luthiers have been on the cutting edge of custom guitar building for decades and their commitment to innovative design and impeccable quality cannot be overstated. They simply make some of the best electric guitars available. This Drop Top Classic from 2004 is a brilliant example of everything that Anderson is known for. This guitar has a stunning flame maple top, Alder body, tremolo bridge and Tom's award winning hand wound VA pickups. This guitar shows some light play wear in the way of a few minor scuffs on the rear edge of the body but otherwise it was well kept over its 15 year life. It is a perfect player and it includes its original hardshell case.\u00a0 Guitar Model: Drop Top Classic Body Wood: Flame Maple on Alder Body Finish: 6120 Tiger Eye with Binding Neck Wood: Hard Rock Maple Neck Finish: Satin Finish Neck Back Shape: .030 inch oversized Nut Width: 1 5/8 in Frets: Medium Hardware Color: Chrome Bridge: Vintage Tremolo Pickups: VA12 VA12R VA23 Pickguard: White Pearloid Switching: 5 Way, Mini Switch Splits, Pull Adds Bridge, Vintage Voicing Strings: .010-.046 Elixir strings Buzz Feiten Tuning System: Comments: 1 Rear Strap Button Ryan Fowler's Guitar Experience is one of Maryland's premier brick and mortar guitar shops.
