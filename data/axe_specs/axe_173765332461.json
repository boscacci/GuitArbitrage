{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered for sale is a beautiful Heritage Golden Eagle arch top guitar in Antique natural finish. I am the second owner. I purchased this a couple years ago from the original owner. He purchased it from a Heritage dealer to play in his retirement in 2000. I don't think he ever took it out of the house and just played it lightly at that. I have only played it in my the living room. There are a few slight marks on the pickguard from fingers touching it, otherwise the guitar and hard case are in Excellent +++ condition, like new condition. UPDATE: At the request of several people I have added pictures of the back of guitar, I intended to do this earlier but am getting old and forgetful, LOL. Currently I have D'addario exl 115's on it. The neck is straight, the action is low, the truss rod adjusts fine, does not need any fret work. There are no issues or damage what so ever with this fine hand made instrument. I have new set of flatwound strings that I will include in the sale if you are looking for a more traditional jazz feel. The only thing it needs is someone talented to play and enjoy it. If you are looking at this I am sure you are familiar with Heritage and their story. This is a hand made solid wood guitar. Custom ordered with the upgraded woods package, the maple in the back, sides and neck are just beautiful. Two humbucker pickups and a Johnny Smith style pick guard. It was also ordered with an upgraded 5 ply Cedar Creek case with red lining, it is like new and fits the guitar perfectly. I have the case key and original paper work signed by the original four owners of the company. It also has an eagle inlay in the back of the head stock as well, as I recall this was only done the first few years on the Golden Eagle model. The original owner changed the knobs (not the tuners) to the stairstep style, the original knobs are in the case if you want to change back. This guitar was built when the original owners were actively involved in the hands on building. When I purchased this one a great jazz guitarist and educator told me I would never need or want a better guitar than this one, this was as good as it gets. If your a serious jazz guitarist or soloist this is the ultimate, you just don't get this type tone, responsiveness and quality from imported guitars and I have owned quite a few over the past 40 years. I no longer play much due to health issues and other interests so I have decided to pass this one on to someone who will enjoy it. Please ask any and all questions. Thank you for looking and your interest. Shipping to the lower 48 states, USA only. No international shipping. I will pack in a new guitar shipping box and ship UPS ground for $100.", "ItemID": "173765332461", "EndTime": "2019-02-03T13:45:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-28T00:00:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Heritage-Golden-Eagle-Archtop-Guitar-fantastic-condition-Upgraded-woods-case-/173765332461", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Virginia, USA", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737653324618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VRkAAOSwZqlcM2J-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lGgAAOSwWH1cM2Kx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KLIAAOSw9ptcUHLq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qQEAAOSw1T1cM2LC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qlgAAOSwxoJcUHLQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D4cAAOSwALpcM2LV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/i-QAAOSwlt9cM2L-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/OrMAAOSwN5hcM2NI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4EsAAOSwkDtcM2Ns/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NIMAAOSwXI1cM2OG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/npYAAOSwVN1cUHMD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rkbrmn", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 49, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3285.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3285.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "w***w", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 615}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Heritage Golden Eagle Archtop Guitar, fantastic condition.
