{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Need to sell fast due to Gov Shutdown, looks like I will not be getting a paycheck. Just a little about me. I'm a government employee who works for the FAA ensuring public flying safety. I maintain Air Traffic Control Radios, and Airport Navigation/Weather equipment. I have been serving the country now for 18 years as of Nov. Including the 9 years I served in the US Air Force. I love my job, it is what I did the the USAF. An Electrics Tech on the same equipment as the FAA. I'm still going to work without being paid. It will be 3 weeks on Friday with no end insight of the shutdown. Just getting a little stressed out with the 3 kids I have in school. And hoping I can stretch what I have saved until we get paid again. I also feel like we may need some money to help fill some needs having 3 kids you never know what may happen. Last year I was diagnosed with stage 1 colon cancer at the age of 38. I was glad it was found early and just need to have it removed. But with trips to the oncologist, colonoscopies and cancer genetic tests our saving funds dwindled fast. Things are looking good from the cancer stand point. Looks like they got it all and I see the oncologist every 6 months for blood work and follow ups. Sorry about the rambling..... Buy why Is Congress Getting Paid? I've been going to work for 10 Hrs days and we (Us Workers) have nothing to show for it. Blame goes both ways. We are being used by both side as a political pawn. Here is a great collectible guitar. Please check out the photos. The 25th is in about 8/10 condition for its age. Plays great, and sounds awesome. Has some a few small dings. Please look at photos. Any questions please ask. Thank you.
