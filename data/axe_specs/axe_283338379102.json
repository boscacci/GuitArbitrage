{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Gibson Les Paul Studio that I am putting up for sale had a professionally repaired neck that is not very noticeable at all. It sounded, looked and felt as good as new after it was fixed. Unfortunately, the guitar fell again and I never got it fixed because I lost interest in playing. This guitar was my baby and I took very well care of it but it does have some scratches and dings as well as a little rust on the pickups and the medal pieces that hold the guitar strap. I don\u2019t even have access to an amp anymore so I have no clue if the electronics on the guitar even work. This guitar will be sold as is and the same way it looks in the picture. I will bubble wrap the guitar and the outside of the Peavey soft shell case that is included in the final sale.
