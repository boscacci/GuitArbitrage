This particular workhorse features a superb blend of tonewoods, giving you rich, strong sound - day in, day out. The J-45 Cutaway features a AA-grade Sitka spruce top for presence, while pattern-grade Honduras mahogany adorns its back and sides. Other touches include hand-scalloped, radiused top bracing, a tapered dovetail neck joint, and a single-ring rosette with 3-ply binding. Rosewood fingerboard with rolled edges and dot inlays The Gibson J-45 Cutaway's fingerboard comprises high-grade rosewood, which is personally inspected and qualified by Gibson experts before it enters the Gibson factories. It's a resilient and durable wood, making way for a balanced and stable fingerboard and giving each chord and note enhanced clarity and bite. The dot inlays on the J-45 are made of genuine mother-of-pearl and are added to the fingerboard using a special Gibson process that eliminates gaps and doesn't require fillers. What's more, the J-45 Cutaway's fingerboard boasts a rolled edge that's lightly beveled, which enhances the instrument's smooth playability. Get amazing sound onstage courtesy of LR Baggs VTC electronics The Gibson J-45 Cutaway comes with LR Baggs' popular VTC acoustic pickup system - a popular choice among Sweetwater's acoustic guitarists. This system features a low-profile under-saddle transducer that's proven more stable and durable than many standard ribbon-type pickups. Its sleek and effective design removes unnecessary internal components to enhance the coupling between the pickup and the guitar and improve the sensitivity of the transducer for a robust, lively, and natural acoustic sound with excellent dynamics and delicate high end. Combined with an onboard preamplifier with an unobtrusive and removable volume control mounted just inside the soundhole, the VTC gives your Gibson Acoustic J-45 Cutaway the amplification you need, with zero compromises for tone or convenience.

They are \"as new\"so nothing more to talk about. \"Mint\" are 9.0 to 9.95 condition. In our opinion it is very difficult for a used guitar to be a perfect ie; may have insignificant fine, slight rub marks on the back, pick marks etc. We do describe any meaningful issues at the top of the listing. If there are minor aesthetic issues such as pick marks or not-thru-the-finish rubs and scratches; expect them. We always note if a case or other accessories is included. Cases and other accessories are not included unless stated or pictured in listing. If unclear, please email questions before you buy, Our replies are frank. We often get the question \"why do your prices change?\" Our prices do not \"change\" but do get temporarily lowered when selected for eBay Markdown. When the Markdown sale ends, eBay automatically returns to the normal listed price. The sales rarely are for the duration of the listing ie; our listings are 30 day listings but Markdown sales end in 7 to 10 days. Do not lose out; The sale time remaining is shown at the top of the listing where the pricing info is displayed. We cannot honor sale prices after the sale ends.
