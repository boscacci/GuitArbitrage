Most deliveries require a signature. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Strat\". I call this one \"Predator \"The Squier maple/rosewood neck near zero fret wear,and has had a nice headstock make over with many coats of clear over the decal. The very cool Gloss Silver Body looks very nice, only the mildest of surface scratches. The pickups have been upgraded with some nice hot Dragonfire Invader style ceramic single coils with chrome pickup covers,and the guitar has been wired for tone control on all three pickups.The bridge and neck pickups both work with the neck pickups tone control. Nice to have tone control on the bridge pickup,makes it a lot more versatile. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. The capacitor has been upgraded with a .033uf axial capacitor . More range of tone control and a smoother response. I added the black pickguard,rear tremolo cover, pickup covers,switch tip and whammy bar tip to get the vibe I was going for. This guitar sounds really good,plays good and it looks super cool. This \"Custom Shack\" came out great!!! A very sexy looking guitar,great colors. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too.This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities. I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.
