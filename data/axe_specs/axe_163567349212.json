{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hi! This auction is for a Paul Reed Smith SE 245 Electric Guitar, in a beautiful Whale Blue flame finish. This is the PRS tribute to the Les Paul, with thick body, chunky neck and 24.5\u201d scale length. It sounds incredible with great sustain. I have owned the guitar for about six months, and it has only been played a couple times. It has never left the house, never been gigged, and was always stored in its case away from potential damage. I am a middle-aged guitar hobbyist, and I keep my guitars in pristine condition. This guitar is like brand new in every way. There are no scratches, dings, etc. Even the gloss finish is like a mirror. It comes with original case and all paperwork. Please let me know if you have any questions. Please only US and Canada bidders. Shipping to the Lower 48 States will be a flat rate $40 via UPS Ground. Thanks for looking and have a great day!", "ItemID": "163567349212", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T00:25:02.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-26T18:10:40.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Paul-Reed-Smith-SE-245-Electric-Guitar-Whale-Blue-Perfect-/163567349212", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tariffville, Connecticut", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635673492128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5D8AAOSwHkBcdX~I/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cNoAAOSwBRZcdX~G/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TTUAAOSwj8VcdX~G/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CS8AAOSw0lhcdX~D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ufAAAOSwP79cdX~M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VBwAAOSw5e5cdX~I/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NesAAOSwY7lcdX~M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EgIAAOSwyQVcdX~D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0hkAAOSwJihcdX-6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "06081", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rsm66wd", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 166, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 305.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "9***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 21}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Paul Reed Smith SE 245 Electric Guitar, Whale Blue - Perfect!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 195, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
