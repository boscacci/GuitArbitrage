{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Strat MIM Black And White, Custom Pickups and Schaller Locking Tunners. With hard shell case. I bought this Mexican Strat new in 2003. In 2009 I replaced the pickups: Fender Noiseless (Neck), Fender Texas Special (Mid), Seymour Duncan SSL-5 (Bridge). I also replaced the Tuners to Fender Schaller Locking Tuners. These tuners greatly help the guitar stay in tune as I like a setup which allows me to use the whammy bar to bend sharp a half-step. Later I replaced the Fender Noiseless with a pickup recommended by the guy who does my setup. Unfortunately, I don't recall the brand of this pickup but it sounds much better than the Noiseless which I found to be a bit dull. I've included the Noiseless in this purchase. The Texas Special sounds great but the real star is the Seymour Duncan which absolutely sings. I chose this pickup because it is what David Gilmour uses in his Black Strat setup. I used a Tube Screamer and an MXR Carbon Copy going through a Fender Blues Jr. amp and I was so happy. The setup is based on tuning down to E-flat, GHS 10-46 strings and a high action. I recommend the high action if you don't use this presently; I think the tone improves as well as your playing. TrueTone in Santa Monica did all the setups and customizing. They do great work. Extras: Original Whammy bar, (I used a shorter Whammy), Original three pickups, Six pack of GHS 10-46 strings, Fender Hardshell case, the Noiselss pickup mentioned above. I hate selling this guitar because I love it but unfortunately I need the money.
