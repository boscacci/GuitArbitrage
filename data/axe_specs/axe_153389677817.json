{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Esp E-II Eclipse. Condition is Used. Shipped with USPS Priority Mail. Hey guys this one is as new. It was used very little and just confirmed I\u2019m a Gibson man. Guitar is in excellent condition has no noticeable finish issues or bumps and bruises. Comes with strap locks installed and a Levi strap. Will be shipped in a hard shell case. Good luck!On Feb-19-19 at 14:20:40 PST, seller added the following information: ******** IMPORTANT!!! Hey everyone as an additional note. The package size was changed from feet to inches by ebays calculators so the SHIPPING QUOTE ISN\u2019T VALID. SHIPPING OF THIS ITEM IS VERY EXPENSIVE LOOK UP QUOTES BEFORE BIDDING! Also there will be a signature required for delivery. On international sales you will be required to meet all requirements set by eBay so that both you and I the seller are protected from fraud. Meaning if you\u2019re out of country a signature will be required for delivery! Also you will have to pay whatever the additional cost is. It is not included in this auction and will be adjusted after the listing ends as that is when I can change it. The package will be approximately 22\u201dx 60\u201dx 6\u201d and approximately 20 pounds. Sorry for any issues this may cause but eBay won\u2019t allow any changes. THIS IS A ONE AND ONLY THEREFORE THERE SHALL BE NO RETURNS OR EXCHANGES. If you\u2019re worried about damage I suggest you insure the package for the cost of replacement which is approximately 1900$ us. Thanks and happy bidding!On Feb-22-19 at 17:34:09 PST, seller added the following information: Sorry that I didn\u2019t catch this sooner but the update above is no longer true.
