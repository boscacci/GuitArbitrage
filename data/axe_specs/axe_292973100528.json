{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "When I first got this guitar, I thought it was jetglo (black). But it's not!It's actually a dark, metallic blue, and under leds the blue really shows up.I've had lots of Rickys before, but this one was set up all wrong when I got it. I restrung it with Pyramid golds (John Lennon's string), lowered the action a ton, and fixed the intonation. Now she plays perfectly....and sounds like a dream. The 660 has a little wider neck than the 330/360. I like it a lot, but it's not for everyone.New condition. Those are photos of the actual guitar.The Model 660 features a charactered Maple cutaway body based on an innovative design from the 1950's. A Rosewood fingerboard is punctuated beautifully with triangular pearloid inlay markers, while the maple double bound neck and body are solid through and through. Rickenbacker's trademark \"checkered\" black and white binding set off the body, while white binding graces the neck. The 660 is electronically engineered to the exacting standards of the vintage reissue series, complete with Rickenbacker's own vintage reissue-type pickups.Body: solidNumber of frets: 21Scale length: 24 3/4\"Neck width at nut: 1 3/4\"Neck width at 12th fret: 2 1/16\"Crown radius: 10\"Body wood: Charactered mapleNeck wood: Charactered mapleFingerboard wood: RosewoodWeight: 8.0 lbsOverall length: 37\"Overall width: 13 1/4\"Overall depth: 1 1/4\"Neck binding: YesFret markere style: TriangleTailpiece: TrapezeBridge: Six saddleNeck type: Through-bodyNumber of pickups: TwoType of pickups: Vintage reissueOutput type: MonoMachine heads: Gotoh Vintage-typeIncludes rickenbacker hardshell case", "ItemID": "292973100528", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T16:02:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T22:09:24.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rickenbacker-660-Midnight-Blue-2017-/292973100528", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Somerset, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929731005288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NFgxNjAw/z/m7sAAOSwWbZcbc6e/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY0/z/lsQAAOSwvSNcbc8s/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzUwWDQ4NA==/z/LGQAAOSwI7Zcbc7-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDUwWDEyMDA=/z/NhwAAOSwyUpcbc7-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njc1WDU0NQ==/z/zs8AAOSw6Ptcbc7-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NFgxNjAw/z/vc4AAOSw0IBcbc7~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY0/z/KhsAAOSwfiZcbc7~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY0/z/yGoAAOSwyXtcbc7~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIzNlgxNjAw/z/FVcAAOSwWiJcbc8A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY0/z/IXQAAOSwWTZcbc7~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY0/z/VhoAAOSwmxVcbc8A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NFgxNjAw/z/cAUAAOSwBlRcbc8A/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08873", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "donadam49", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 583, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rickenbacker 660 Midnight Blue 2017", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Rickenbacker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["660"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 20, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
