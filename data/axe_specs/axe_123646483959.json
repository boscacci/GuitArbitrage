{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Includes original molded JP case, tremolo arm, certificate of authenticity, and other shown case candy. I ship all my guitars with UPS (can ship FedEx if preferred) and always insure the guitar for its full value. Here we have a used JP15 with a beautiful flamed maple top and a birdseye maple board. This top is much nicer than a lot of the JP15s I have seen and has a beautiful tight flame. The guitar does not have any issues to it and everything functions as it should. The bride and tuners are smooth, the electronics and piezo work properly, and the neck is straight. The roasted maple is extremely smooth! It is by far my favorite neck wood as it is more stable and lighter than regular maple, and has a beautiful appearance to it. Condition: It is in very good condition, but it has been played, and does show some signs of wear. Please view the photos closely to get the best idea of the guitars condition. There are pick scratches and polish swirls on the guitar. There is a small ding between the bride and volume knob and pick scratches.There are a couple small dings around the top edge of the body (pictures 18 & 19) and around the bottom edge. There is a small ding next to the high e tuner.
