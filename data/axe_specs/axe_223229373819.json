{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Used ES-339 in very good condition. Comes with gig bag, a nice matching strap I picked up and a set of new strings (the current strings need to be replaced). Plays very well and has original equipment chrome Humbuckers that I think sound and look a lot better than the black plastic pickups on some of the Pro models. This one had some damage to the neck, but it was expertly repaired at the Sam Ash store in Miami - see the close up photos of the underside of the neck. To me, the repairs made the guitar as good as new, just with some cosmetic damage and slight rough feeling. The repair man also replaced the stock plastic nut with a bone one, and put all-black Gibson control knobs on it instead of the stock black/silver ones. I played it almost daily for a couple years after the repairs and never had a problem. The only reason I'm selling it is that I got a Gibson ES-339 and I just don't play the Epiphone any more. Feel free to contact me with any questions or for more photos.", "ItemID": "223229373819", "EndTime": "2019-01-30T22:30:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-13T18:48:58.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-ES-339-Semi-hollow-Body-Pelham-Blue-Includes-Gig-Bag-Strap-Strings-/223229373819", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Dania, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232293738198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/irYAAOSwMjpb6xnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kwsAAOSwxJ9b6xnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QpMAAOSw9E5b6xnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e0sAAOSwlx9b6xnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EgYAAOSwwSJb6xnP/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Yr0AAOSwB9Fb6xnQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Kn8AAOSw1fJb6xnQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/chIAAOSwe~lb6xnN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QhAAAOSwjrFb6xnQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1mEAAOSwQIFb6xpK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j3cAAOSwPrtb6xnO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jgsAAOSwuWJb6xsW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33004", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "02sportyrider", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 32, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 395.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone ES-339 Semi-hollow Body Pelham Blue - Includes Gig Bag, Strap, Strings", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "BodyType", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-339"]}, {"Name": "Material", "Value": ["Pau Ferro, Mahogany, Maple"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 624, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
