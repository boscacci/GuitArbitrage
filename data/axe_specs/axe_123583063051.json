{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2015 Gibson Les Paul Traditional Mahogany Top up for auction. This guitar is gorgeous and in mint condition. The action is perfect and the tone and sustain are incredible - so warm and full. It is hard to let go of it, but I need to free up some cash to cover another recent purchase. Comes with original hardshell case and all case candy. The guitar has always been kept in my smoke-free and pet-free studio. It is entirely stock except for two small adjustments that can easily be reversed: 1) I replaced the G-Force automatic tuning system with locking manual tuners. I selected these tuners because they did not require drilling any new holes in the headstock, so they can be removed without a trace. The original G-Force system will be included and can be restored easily, although I much prefer the guitar with traditional tuners. 2) I replaced the original brass nut with Gibson's improved titanium nut. You can easily switch it back (original nut will be included), but you won't want to -- the titanium nut is far superior. Please note: this guitar is not weight-relieved (for maximum tone and sustain) and thus is on the heavy side relative to other Les Paul models. It also has the chunkier '50s neck. ----- Additional info from the Gibson website: The Limited Edition Les Paul Traditional Mahogany Top adds the enhanced warmth and resonance of that exalted tonewood to the un-routed mahogany body that gives this model its superb punch and sustain. Each guitar is numbered with a three-digit number indicating its place in the total number of guitars made. PICKUPS\u201959 TRIBUTE HUMBUCKERS FOR LEGENDARY PAF-STYLE TONES.
