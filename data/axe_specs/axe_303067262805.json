{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You are looking at a used 2005 Ibanez AFS75T Artcore Hollow Body Electric Guitar in Transparent Cherry Red finish. This is a used guitar and does show cosmetic wear. There is some scuffing on the headstock and the body of the guitar, and a few small spots on the back of the body that the clear finish is starting to come off. Some of the metal on the front of the guitar by the whammy bar has some slight dulling. The red cherry finish is beautiful and unique. This is a very cool guitar and would make a great addition to anyone's collection! Everything has been tested, and the guitar functions as it should. Please see all pictures! PLEASE READ THESE 15 THINGS BEFORE BIDDING: Make sure to read every listing completely and carefully and look at all photos before bidding.

Minor cosmetic blemishes and signs of use might not be mentioned, so PLEASE ASK if you're concerned about such things and can't tell by looking at the pictures what to expect. If the item is perfect or almost perfect (near new), the listing will let you know, otherwise please assume it has some signs of use if it is listed as used. This store uses UPS and USPS shipping.
