{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a super cool rare LP Junior Double Cut, with a single dog ear P90 pickup. These guitars are very hard to find, and this one is very, very clean. considering it is 21 years old. It has typical swirl marks in the finish from wiping, and one tiny mark on the heel of the treble side of the body, (see the last pic). A few tiny pin sized marks here and there but nothing bad at all... I\u2019m very meticulous with keeping all of my Instruments super clean and looking nice and polished. This guitar will clean and not all smudged up and greasy, like a lot of other guitars you see for sale. I would typically list this in excellent condition however I don\u2019t want anybody to be misled by the tiny little mark that is on the finish. This guitar is super clean, it plays and sounds great. The frets have been polished, it has a brand new set of 09-46 gauge Ernie Ball strings installed, it is super clean and ready to go.The P90 pick up sounds incredible, it cleans up nice, and it gets super growly when you need it to. It comes with a used fender gig bag, I ship fast and secure, please ask any questions you may have. Thanks.", "ItemID": "323598148651", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T14:17:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T19:17:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Junior-Double-Cut-P90-1997-W-Gigbag-/323598148651", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Saint Clair Shores, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235981486518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/x30AAOSwVH9cEq9N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/EcMAAOSwsrlcEq97/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/rrkAAOSw~2VcEq9s/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/wPUAAOSwOVlcEq9u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/WJ0AAOSwFx5cEq95/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/IVQAAOSwfplcEq9q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/d8sAAOSw6~pcEq91/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/E0sAAOSwEVlcEq9y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/2doAAOSwZupcEq9-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/qV0AAOSwrblcEq93/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/XhMAAOSwJOJcEq9w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/4CEAAOSwmOBcEq-V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48080", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "herbonguitar", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 39, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1076}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul Junior Double Cut P90 1997 W/Gigbag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Junior"]}]}, "HitCount": 168, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
