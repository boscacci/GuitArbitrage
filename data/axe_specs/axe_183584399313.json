Serial number 18011507077. Hand crafted in China. Included with the guitar is an Epiphone Hardshell Case. Go to the link below to get info and specs : http://www.epiphone.com/Products/Les-Paul/Les-Paul-ES-PRO.aspx Check out Youtube.com for video demo's I checked the serial number on guitardaterproject.org. Info below: Your guitar was made at the Qingdao Plant (Epiphone), China on January, 2018 Production Number: 07077 About This Guitar & Case: This 2018 Epiphone Les Paul ES PRO is in near mint condition. Since I am not the original owner I am forced to list it as used here on Ebay. It has next to no play time on it. No wear of any kind. Still has the retail stickers on it. The Trans Black finish is really awsome. Hard to find too. I only played it maybe 20 minutes just to check it out. Neck is really nice. Action is on the low side but a set up will get it to your specs. Pick ups are great and they can be coil split !!! Real nice feature on this axe. The hollowbody makes it easy to play. Much lighter than expected. I give this guitar a 9.5 out of 10. Great guitar at a great price !!! Case FYI... The Epiphone Hardshell Case that comes with the guitar is in very good condition and includes 1 key for the locking latch. There are a couple of spots on the plush lining where the fur is matted down. To me it looks like glue from the factory. It is not bad but I like to disclose any issues. It does not affect how the guitar lays in the case. Other than that the case looks almost brand new. DISCLAIMER ***Important Information about this listing.
