{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "SHIPPING TO THE CONTINENTAL U.S. ONLY Here's a sweet EVH Wolfgang Special with a gloss black finish and birdseye maple fingerboard with stainless steel frets and a smooth satin neck. It comes with the added benefits of a locking nut with fine tuners on the made in Germany tailpiece. It has a Tonepros tune-o-matic bridge and EVH tuners. The EVH humbuckers sound great with a wide range of sound capabilities wired to a 3 way switch with a low friction EVH 500k volume pot and a high friction EVH 250k tone pot that stays put where you want it. This Japan model has several of these features that the current Mexican models don't. Save hundreds of dollars here on one that is in practically new condition with only minor signs of normal use. It does have a \"used\" stamp on the back of the headstock and the previous history is unknown but this guitar is in perfect working condition. The neck and frets are perfect and the entire guitar has no signs of damage or repair. It just received a professional detailed check and setup and comes with the well padded weather resistant EVH gig bag pictured with the guitar. It will be well packed for safe insured shipping and feel free to ask for more info or detailed pics. 100% Positive feedback on everything I've sold!
