{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a 2016 Epiphone Les Paul Plus Top Pro guitar in the \"heritage cherry burst\" finish. This guitar is in absolutely pristine condition. The finish is like glass. Not even a hint of \"buckle rash\". This guitar has been upgraded. The Asian-made Epiphone ProBucker pickups have been replaced with American-made Seymour Duncan pickups. There is a JB in the bridge position and a 59 in the neck. This results in more drive from the bridge and a less muddy quality in the neck, as well as overall improved tonal definition. It should be noted that the switching knobs were not replaced. This means that the coil-tapping push-pull switches on the volume knobs are still in place, even though only the SD JB can coil tap. The push-pull switch on the neck SD 59 pickup does nothing, as that pickup is not configured with a tap. This is a great feeling, sweet sounding, and just gorgeous instrument. I've done an updated setup this fall and it has fresh 10s on it. I'm the first and only owner. This has never been gigged and only played and recorded in my smoke-free home studio. Without modifications, this instrument is a tremendous quality value, in my opinion. With the Seymour Duncan upgrades ($200 investment) and the used price drop, this is a steal at under half the original cost to me. Come get a great bargain! I only ship to the continental US. I only accept PayPal payments. I ship in the original boxes with insurance.
