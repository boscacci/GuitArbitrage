{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender 72 Deluxe Telecaster Re-issue in good condition. It does have some blemishes \u2013 lots of scratches on the front, especially to the left of the bridge pickup. The front also has a long, thin scratch and a drop fill of Stewart McDonald black super glue covering a chip along the bottom edge. The drop isn\u2019t completely level, but it looks a little better than a chip and blends in pretty well with the finish. There is a noticeable scratch on the neck pickup. The pickguard is scratched and small holes have been drilled part way through pickguard so you can see which number you\u2019re on with the volume and tone controls. However, it sounds and plays great. It\u2019s been cleaned up and set up, the frets have been dressed, and the pots and wiring replaced with CTS 500K Ohm pots and Orange Drop caps. This clears up a problem with the factory wiring \u2013 they used 250 K Ohm pots, which made the pickups sound muddy. With the new wiring and raising the pole pieces, this guitar can get plenty bright with no hum. Includes Fender gig bag. I will double box to make sure it survives shipping intact.
