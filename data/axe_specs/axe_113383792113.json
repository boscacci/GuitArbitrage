{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I JUST TOOK THIS IN FROM A CUSTOMER. IT IS A KOREAN MADE FENDER SPECIAL EDITION HH TELECASTER. THESE WERE LATER NAMED THE FMT HH SERIES. THE LATER ONES ARE ALSO MADE IN INDONESIA. THE KOREAN MODELS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MORE HIGHLY REGARDED. IT HAS A MAH (SAME WOOD AS LES PAUL) BODY WITH SET MAH NECK. IT HAS A R. WOOD FRETBAORD WITH ABALONE FRET MARKERS. THEY LOOK GREAT IN PERSON. THE FIRST MARKER IS THERE. IT HAS MORE DARK BLUE IN IT. SO FROM CERTAIN ALGLES, IT LOOKS LIKE ITS MISSING. THE GUITAR IS FINISHED IN A TRANSPARENT CHERRY RED THAT REALLT SHOWS OFF THE WOOD GRAIN. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS MARKER ON THE TOP OF THE HEADSTOCK. I WASNT SURE HOW TO REMEVE IT. SO I DIDNT EVEN TRY. IT MAY BE EASY. BUT I DIDNT WANT TO RISK IT. THE NECK IS VERY THIN AND FAST. THE BODY HAS ONE SMALL BLEMISH ON THE BACK BOTTOM EDGE. OTHER THAN THAT, ITS BASICALLY JUST POLISH SWIRLS. IT HAS A 3 WAY SWITCH, MASTER VOLUME AND MASTER TONE. THE TONE POT IS A PUSH/PULL POT THAT SPLITS THE HUMBUCKERS INTO SINGLE COILS. THE PICKUPS SOUND TREMENDOUS IN EITHER MODE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A LES PAUL IN HUMBUCKER MODE AND A TELE/STRAT IN SINGLE COIL. IT IS EXTREMELY WELL SET UP WITH LOW ACTION WITH ERNIE BALL10-46 STRINGS. I WILL TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SHIPPING IS TO THE CONT. US ONLY. SHIPPING TO HAWAII AND ALASKA WILL BE MORE. I WILL SHIP INTERNATIONALLY, BUT ONLY THROUGH EBAYS GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. PLEASE MAKE PAYMENT OR CONTACT WITH ME WITHIN 72 HOURS OF WINNING. THANKS AND GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.", "ItemID": "113383792113", "EndTime": "2018-11-26T15:27:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-19T15:27:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/FENDER-SPECIAL-EDITION-HH-SET-NECK-TELECASTER-TRANSPARENT-RED-FMT-COIL-TAPS-/113383792113", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Paris, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1133837921138080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TN8AAOSw175b4GAM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CaAAAOSwjZlb4GAK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GMYAAOSwKQFb4GAI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-WEAAOSwcs1b4GAH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ub0AAOSwMBdb4GAF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TR0AAOSwFYJb4GAC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/f-oAAOSwwtdb4GAB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ghUAAOSwNqRb4GAE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "40361", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "michaelh571", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2983, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.7, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1927}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "FENDER SPECIAL EDITION HH SET NECK TELECASTER TRANSPARENT RED FMT COIL TAPS", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mah"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Special Run"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["TELECASTER SPECIAL EDITION"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 301, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
