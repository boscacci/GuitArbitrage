{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Good condition/extremely rare Epiphone with Gibson-style, Open-Book headstock. Made in Japan at the Terada Plant, I believe, that is known for it's excellent craftsmanship. This guitar is no different and has a nice, medium neck that plays smoothly. Great tone from USA -made Gibson pickups, there's some argument online as to if they're more like 57 Classics or 498's... I'd like to think they're too smooth for the to be 498's, but who knows/guitar just sounds great. Only reason I'm selling is that the neck is nice and medium-profile, but I've got an ES-333 with a big, girthy neck that I love more, so this one's got to go. Frets are in good condition and look to have 70-75% of their life left...only finish issue are some chips on the headstock and a sticker-ghost on the top (area where the original owner put a sticker that didn't age like the rest of the top...), which is interesting as I thought the Elite line were poly finished and I thought sticker-issues were only on lacquer-finished guitars, but oh well. It's a Epiphone Elite series made exclusively for the Japanese market that I had imported. It's a 1963 ES-335 copy with Original Hardshell Case.", "ItemID": "233023425713", "EndTime": "2018-12-16T15:01:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-27T21:52:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Elite-63-ES-335-W-OHSC-Made-Japan-Guitar-/233023425713", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Sierra Madre, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330234257138080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cmQAAOSwaPNcBwlz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1nIAAOSwIkNcBwl4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YX4AAOSw5qJcBwl5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cqwAAOSw~odcBwl1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2g0AAOSwkHxcBwlt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5kYAAOSwtFxcBwlv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PGUAAOSwVH9cBwly/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7rAAAOSwhspcBwl-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Px0AAOSwAx9cBwl~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QB0AAOSwNUlcBwl8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O0kAAOSwlThcBwl7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wCcAAOSw6iZcBwl2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "91024", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "amazanman1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 151, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1095.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1095.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": ".***.", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 95}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Elite \u201863 ES-335 W/OHSC Made In Japan Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}]}, "HitCount": 423, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money back or replacement (buyer's choice)", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
