The new SG Original from Gibson USA brings back the look, feel, and tone of the most desirable SG Standards ever made, thanks to the use of Grade-A tonewoods, exacting specs, and premium hardware and pickups. From the slim \u201960s neck profile, to the trim early \u201960s headstock shape and smaller \u201961 pickguard, to the tonally rich and versatile \u201957 Classic humbucking pickups, to the vibrola tailpiece with \u201clyre\u201d cover, the SG Original nails the vibe of the seminal SG in every respect, bringing you a stunning \u201creissue\u201d style guitar at an impressively affordable price. With its high-gloss nitrocellulose finish in Heritage Cherry, complemented by acrylic trapezoid inlays, it looks superb, too, and offers the unparalleled playability you only get from a genuine Gibson.The construction of any great electric guitar begins with great woods, and the new SG Original from Gibson USA has a foundation of some of the most hallowed tonewoods in Gibson history. The body is made from solid Grade-A mahogany, a wood known for its depth and richness, and crafted in the distinctive, thin asymmetrical dual-cutaway style, with iconic pointed \u201chorns\u201d and beveled edges to enhance playing comfort. The glued-in neck is also made from Grade-A mahogany, this time cut to the quarter-sawn orientation for superior strength and resonance, and carved to a fast, slim \u201960s SG profile that measures .800\u201d deep at the 1st fret and .890\u201d at the 12th. It is topped with a bound fingerboard made from a single piece of Grade-A rosewood, with a 12\u201d radius, 22 medium-jumbo frets, and a PLEK-cut Corian\u2122 nut with a width of 1 11/16\u201d\u2014all major factors in Gibson\u2019s legendary playing feel. The larger vintage-style headstock has the classic mother-of-pearl Gibson logo and holly inlays. The SG Original recreates the great tones of vintage SG Standards via a pair of \u201957 Classic humbucking pickups, some of the most popular recreations of vintage PAF humbuckers available today. Each carries a genuine Alnico II bar magnets and is wound with 42-AWG enamel-coated wire, for the characteristic blend of warmth and creaminess that made original PAFs legendary, updated with wax potting for howl-free performance at high volume levels. The traditional wiring complement of an independent volume and tone control per pickup plus a three-way toggle selector switch allows a broad range of sonic variations. Gibson USA loads in a Tune-o-Matic bridge with a Lyre vibrato tailpiece to expand your playing horizons, and a set of genuine TonePros\u2122 vintage-style tuners with an efficient 16:1 gear ratio for rock-solid tuning. Add it all up, and for look, feel, and tone, the SG Original is a stunning recreation of the iconic early \u201960s SG Standard. _gsrx_vers_841 (GS 7.0.16 (841))", "ItemID": "273687530725", "EndTime": "2019-02-22T02:16:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-05T23:24:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/UNPLAYED-Gibson-SG-Original-Maestro-2018-Cherry-OHSC-/273687530725", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Ramona, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736875307258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/flIAAOSwpLdcWhsK/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/k0sAAOSw2fpcWhsQ/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/A0wAAOSw66JcWhsQ/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/lQcAAOSwAdFcWhsZ/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/Y24AAOSwUpFcWhsY/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/FCUAAOSwZKlcWhsk/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/WWEAAOSw9eVcWhsh/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/zwkAAOSwpzRcWhsr/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/CPYAAOSwgCpcWhsp/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/3RsAAOSw1jpcWhsv/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/NQYAAOSwLeFcWhs0/$_3.JPG", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNTk5/z/qs8AAOSwg-tcWhs4/$_3.JPG"], "PostalCode": "92065", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "loviesguitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1040, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1895.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1895.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "7***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 234}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "Asia", "AU"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "UNPLAYED!
