{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Will ship worldwide - message me and i will check how much it will cost to ship it to you. Please watch the close up video for more details: https://youtu.be/MmsIIApBUyY For sale my 2006 Jackson RR3 Rhoads in Transparent Red finish. This is a Japanese model from Pro series. It is a very high quality instrument and is in excellent condition. The guitar sounds exceptionally good, very resonant. The Jackson tremolo bridge stays in tune very well. The Seymour Duncan JB(TB-4) and Jazz(SB-2N) pickups compliment the guitar and make it sound professional. This model has long been discontinued and it is superior to the current ones coming from Indonesia. The Japanese factory doesn't make Jacksons anymore and if you are looking for one of similar quality your closest bet would Mexican one costing you around \u00a3900. I am very reluctant to sell it, but I have to thin down my collection. The guitar was just restrung with set of Ernie Ball 11-54, comes with molded Jackson SKB hardcase (worth \u00a3120 alone) and will be well packed for shipping. I am happy to answer any questions and will consider reasonable offers.Please check my other listings.Condition: The playing condition is very good and without any problems!
