{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2009 Squier Bullet Strat Here is a very nice Squier Strat in the rare pink finish! The serial number dates it to 2009. Actual weight is 7 lbs 5 oz.The body is in excellent condition overall. There is one small ding on the top (under the bridge) and hairline finish cracks coming off the neck pocket. These are only cosmetic and and are common on Stratocaster style guitars. There are some other minor streaks visible in the light, but the body is very clean overall. The neck is straight and the frets show very little wear. It's in excellent playing condition with no dead frets or other major issues. The fretboard is clean and the back of the neck has a few small impressions. The headstock has a few small marks along the top edge, but no major issues. No cracks, repairs or extra holes. The hardware and electronics are original and in excellent working condition. It comes with a Windsor gig bag that has a few tears on the front, but the zipper works. It's not fancy but it gets the job done! A nice black strap, patch cable and the tremolo bar are also included.Please note that I do not set up my guitars before mailing. I have played it and everything is great as far as I'm concerned, but you may need to change the strings, adjust the action or do other maintenece to get it to your preferences. I list some of my items on both eBay and Reverb. In the event that this item sells on both marketplaces before I can take the other listing down, I will honor the first sale and refund the second. There will be no exceptions to this! SHIPPING & PAYMENTI only accept PayPal for my listings. Payment must be received within 4 days after I send the invoice. I am willing to work with you if you need more time, but I will open an unpaid item case if I do not hear from you after 4 days!

Also let me know if you have won some items and plan to bid on others so that I can hold off on packaging the items until you've purchased everything you want.eBay's shipping calculator is not always accurate on larger items.
