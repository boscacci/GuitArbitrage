{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Line 6 Variax JTV-69. Condition is Used. Shipped with USPS Priority Mail. Plays great, whether using the digital modeling or the pickups. The regular magnetics actually sound pretty good, but I usually left the modeling engaged and switched back and forth between the Tele model for clean sounds and the Les Paul model for rock sounds with the Firebird for metal. The Strat model is good, I just don\u2019t like Strats and never played one. And I\u2019d occasionally play the acoustic models, which, played well in an ensemble setting, make for a reasonable facsimile of an acoustic guitar sound. Though the modeling software boasts 29 different guitars, you\u2019ll zero in on four or five that you like best. And that\u2019s where the value shows up with this thing. You can switch between those five guitars with the flick of a switch during the set, during the song even, without keeping an arsenal of axes on the stage. I even programmed the POD HD500X to switch the guitar model for me when I changed the patch on the floor pedal. One step on the footswitch. This thing is a great guitar. Owned it for six years. Perfect for playing in a church band because the virtual capo made it a piece of cake to change keys without needing an actual capo or changing the tuning on the guitar; just rotate the tuning knob. The singer can sing the song in whatever key they want, just tell me what it is and let the modeling shift up or down from there. With a flick of the switch, I can go from playing Slipknot\u2019s \u201cPsychosocial\u201d in Drop A to some church song in standard tuning, without changing the string tension or strings. I know, I know, those two don\u2019t usually go together.... Really hate to part company with it - there\u2019s no problems with it whatsoever - this has been a workhorse. Holds its tuning really well. Wanting to upgrade to the JTV Shuriken so I have to sell this to get the money for it. You know how it goes... Gotta sell one toy to make room for the next. The only blemish is the pickguard has scratches from years of playing. Which is to be expected. Works best with a POD HD500X or Helix. I powered the guitar right off the HD500X floor pedal with the cat 5 cable that\u2019s included. The rechargeable battery lets you play it with any rig. If i find the battery charger before shipping, I\u2019ll throw it in. Else, you can get a replacement charger from Line 6 or on Amazon. Includes the Line 6 logo gig bag, cat 5 cable, tremolo arm, and owners manual.", "ItemID": "303061717512", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T03:45:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-14T03:45:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Line-6-Variax-JTV-69-HSS-/303061717512", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Des Moines, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030617175128080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6UEAAOSw3AFcZN3S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sl8AAOSw6DNcZN3U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WS4AAOSw24hcZN3V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FhAAAOSw0yVcZN3X/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GpYAAOSwvjtcZN3c/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PJsAAOSwufFcZN3Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/m38AAOSwinlcZN3Z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/v7MAAOSwj8VcZN3b/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ByIAAOSwqiRcZN3e/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IkoAAOSwqCJcZN3f/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cjUAAOSwcOtcZN3h/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YkkAAOSwsrBcZOKi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "50320", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "generator810", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 61, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 80.0}, "BidCount": 26, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 620.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 620.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 6}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Line 6 Variax JTV-69 HSS", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Line 6"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Variax"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["HSS"]}]}, "HitCount": 400, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 630.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
