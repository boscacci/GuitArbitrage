Enjoy unparalleled consistency and tonal variety at any volume level, from the quietest whisper to a mighty roar, while experiencing the bleeding edge of modern guitar craftsmanship and construction.The Pro Monarkh SC features a 24.75\" scale length, mahogany body with an arched maple cap and ash top, and a speedy one-piece set maple neck with a scarf joint and pair of graphite reinforcement rods, providing stiffness and high stability to guard against temperature- and humidity-induced bending and warping. Enjoy Jackson\u2019s familiar effortless playing feel with a 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius ebony fingerboard featuring 22 jumbo frets and pearloid ghostfin inlays.The modern-day metal guitarist requires tonal versatility and super clarity to keep up with the rapid twists and turns of modern metal. A classic Seymour Duncan\u00ae humbucking combo delivers all that and more, with a JB bridge pickup for heavy riffage and a \u201959 neck pickup for creamy leads. The Jackson compensated and fully adjustable TOM-style bridge creates perfect intonation along the entire length of the neck to ensure complex chords ring true, while the anchored tailpiece and die-cast locking tuning machines work in harmony for tuning stability that can withstand a good pick-hand thrashing without shifting.Cloaked in classic Jackson style, the Pro Monarkh SC Ash is available in Charcoal Ash and features black hardware and black binding around the body, neck and 3x3 AT-1 headstock.", "ItemID": "183564917627", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T05:32:50.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T19:22:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-PRO-SERIES-MONARKH-SC-ASH-Charcoal-Ash-/183564917627", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Collinsville, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1835649176278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YYIAAOSwSzpcBDCq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KAYAAOSwF5hcBDCq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qzUAAOSw22FcBDCn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/95gAAOSwXI1cBDCo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5JkAAOSwqRlcBDCn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iPsAAOSwPg9cBDCo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/p68AAOSwDPNcBDCn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/V8gAAOSwcnZcBDCo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/H48AAOSwTc5cBDCq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rCkAAOSwtvZcBDCr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YxkAAOSwSlpcBDCr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q18AAOSwhnlcBDCs/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "62234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dongeomac", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 731, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 27}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson PRO SERIES MONARKH SC ASH Charcoal Ash", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Ash"]}]}, "HitCount": 223, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
