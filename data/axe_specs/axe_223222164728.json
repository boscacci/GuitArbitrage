{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Like new Squire Affinity Stratocaster customized with real Fender electrical components and a DiMarzio Cruiser stacked bridge humbucker. The middle and neck pickups sound quite good. Action is low with absolutely no buzz. Rosewood fingerboard is a beauty. Frets about 99%. Tight neck pocket. Really a great guitar for the price. I will include a nice gig bag and a \"FaceLift\" Rock overlay (see last photo) that can be easily applied or removed from the guitar. The overlay is really cool and will not harm the finish. It also matches the color of the guitar perfectly. Total for extras and the installation by a pro is roughly $180. You won't be disappointed. I bought this guitar mainly because I love the color, but I have since acquired about 8 other instruments and have to reduce my inventory. The Cruiser by DiMarzio: Harmonic overtones are right where you expect them to be from a \u201ctrue\u201d single-coil, and the mid-range is open and vocal-sounding. It\u2019s hotter than the traditional single-coil, and the bass strings have a bit more chunk; this is an excellent pickup to maintain its tonal identity with high-gain amps and multiple effects.
