{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "We are offering a VERY limited edition Dean Guitar, produced in the 1980\u2019s. This listing is for one guitar only (the Busch) guitar is being offered in a seperate listing. Budweiser Dean Guitar:The Dean Budweiser Bow-Tie guitar. A classic eye catching design. This guitar was only around for a very short time (it was a limited edition to begin with) and the story has it that Dean was sued by none other than Bo Diddley because he had a similar guitar body style\u2026 and he (Bo Diddley) won, and production was immediately stopped. Very Rare indeed. This guitar also comes with a even rarer fitted hard-shell (fender style) case. I have only seen a couple of these ever offered for sale with the case. Neil Young recently announced that he is selling off a number of items from his personal collection, Trains, Cars, and guitars! One of the guitars he is selling is his Budweiser Dean guitar. It\u2019s said that Neil partly got the idea for his song \u201cThis Note\u2019s For You\u201d from this guitar! Now that\u2019s pretty cool! Condition: The Dean Budweiser guitar has been played, and it has a couple of minor marks/chips here and there, none are visable on the front of the guitar, (see close up photos). The neck is straight, the tuners are tight like new. The hard shell case has a few very minor bumps and dings on the outside, and a little wear on the inside from the guitar rubbing through the years. This guitar should be set up before playing. Over all in excellent condition. I\u2019ve kept this guitar stored for years in its respective case in a tempeture controled atmosphere. More photos can be available upon request for serious buyers.
