{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Item is like new and in great working order. The Danelectro Dano Pro is an electric guitar made by Danelectro in 1963 and 1964, reissued in 2007 and again in 2012. The original was a 3/4 scale guitar with a single lipstick tube pickup, made by putting the pickup in surplus lipstick tubes purchased from a cosmetics supplier. The reissue features two lipstick pickups compared to the original. The pickups are wired in series rather than in parallel as is common with most electric guitars. Because of this, the guitar is louder when the toggle is set to both the neck and bridge pickups rather than when only one pickup is selected. The guitar body is hollow, made of masonite and plywood with a maple neck and rosewood fingerboard. The body's vaguely trapezoidal shape has led to it being described as a bowtie or Flintstone guitar. The original had a short scale neck with a non-adjustable bridge. The reissue has a fully adjustable bridge and a full scale neck of 19 frets with the neck connecting to the body at the 14th fret. Because of this, playing the higher frets is nearly impossible. Its light tone and slight twang makes it very suitable for playing jangle pop, surf, country and blues.", "ItemID": "323545461663", "EndTime": "2018-11-19T03:08:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-12T03:08:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Danelectro-Dano-Pro-/323545461663", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Kippens, Newfoundland And Labrador", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235454616638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ba8AAOSwX6Rb6OzT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bI4AAOSwp7Rb6OzQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6okAAOSw5Ylb6OzN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nCwAAOSwGD1b6OzO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "A2N 3B8", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "x2005fsd", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 28, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.71, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 465.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 88}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Danelectro Dano Pro", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Danelectro"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Peach"]}]}, "HitCount": 296, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 470.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
