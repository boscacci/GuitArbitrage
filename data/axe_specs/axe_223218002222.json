{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1991 Orville by Gibson Firebird V. Orville was Gibson\u2019s Japanese like produced from 1988-1998. I purchased this used about 5 years ago and it\u2019s just not getting the attention it deserves. Original Firebird banjo style tuners and Gibson USA pickups (denoted by the \u2018G\u2019 serial number). The neck strap button has been relocated to the back by previous owner. The truss rod cover was replaced with a Gibson example and I do not have the original. There is minimal buckle rash on the back and the original strap button hole (see photos) otherwise the finish is in excellent condition. Guitar is currently set up for .011\u2019s. The Gibson USA case was purchased separately but appears to be from the same period. There is some paint on the back of the case (it appears to be craft paint and easily removed: I just never got around to it) and a few handling marks (as shown in photos) but the case functions perfectly. Shipping to the lower 48 will be $60 w/ insurance and tracking.", "ItemID": "223218002222", "EndTime": "2018-11-10T02:51:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-05T02:51:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Orville-Gibson-Firebird-V-/223218002222", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "McKeesport, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232180022228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/UlYAAOSwpYxb36sn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TpUAAOSwyWxb36st/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iBsAAOSwt~1b36sw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xLgAAOSwtcRb36sy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0uUAAOSwDaBb36su/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-7EAAOSwIDJb36sp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iwUAAOSwAE9b36sr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15131", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "postie_wannabe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 125, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 10, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 760.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 760.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1359}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Orville by Gibson Firebird V", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Orville by Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Firebird V"]}]}, "HitCount": 272, "Subtitle": "\u201891 w/ Gibson hard shell case", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 770.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
