SERIAL # 521809 THIS LISTING INCLUDES: (1) 1974 FENDER TELECASTER DELUXE ELECTRIC GUITAR CONDITION REPORT: VERY GOOD CONDITION!!! Please expect nicks and scratches commensurate with age. Original frets are in good shape. We got this guitar a few years ago from the original owner. Doesn't look like a screw was ever touched or turned on this guitar. The plastic knob for the pickup switch is missing. I think Switchcraft made switches for Fender & Gibson in the 70's, so a Gibson Les Paul switch tip in black should fit. Original case was sold years ago and is no longer available. SHIPS PRO-PACKED to ENSURE a SAFE ARRIVAL!!! 30-DAY MONEY BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE WHEN YOU BUY IT NOW for $2995!
