{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "THIS IS A 1988 CARVIN DC135 IN GREAT SHAPE. I RECENTLY TOOK IT IN AS TRADE. IT HAS A MAPLE NECK THRU MAPLE DESIGN. IT IS STILL IN GREAT, BUT NOT PERFECT CONDITION. THERE ARE A COUPLE VERY SMALL DINGS, A SCUFF SPOT ON THE BACK AND A VERY SMALL HAIRLINE FINISH CRACK. ITS JUST IN THE FINISH, NOT THE WOOD. THE FRETBOARD IS NICE THICK MAPLE WITH 24 JUMBO FRETS SHOWING NO WEAR. THE FRET MARKERS ARE A GORGEOUS ABALONE. THIS ONE HAS THE LAWSUIT HEADSTOCK BEFORE JACKSON MADE THEM CHANGE. IT WAS ONLY USED FOR A SHORT TIME. ITS LOADED WITH THE KAHLER PRO TREMOLO THAT WORKS TREMENDOUSLY WELL AND DOESNT REQUIRE REMOVING A HUGE CHUNK OF WOOD FROM THE GUITAR. SO IT IS WARMER AND FULLER THAN A FLOYD WITH MORE SUSTAIN. ITS LOADED WITH THE ORIGINAL CARVIN M22SD HUMBUCKER AND 2 H11 STACKED COILS. THE STACKS HAVE THE ORIGINAL PICKUP RINGS. CARVIN CHANGED TO THE RINGLESS DESIGN SHORTLY AFTER. THE CONTROLS ARE MASTER VOLUME AND MASTER TONE. THE 3 WAY PICKUP TOGGLE SWITCHES ARE: ON(TRUE SINGLE COIL/OFF/NOISELESS SINGLE COIL SWITCHES FOR THE SINGLE COILS, A SERIES(HUMBUCKER/OFF/SINGLE SWITCH FOR THE HUMBUCKER AND A PHASE SWITCH FOR THE BRIDGE (IN EITHER SERIES OR SINGLE). IT MAKES THE GUITAR PRETTY VERSATILE. ALL 3 PICKUPS SOUND FANTASTIC. IT HAS A MODERN THIN C PROFILE NECK FOR FAST PLAY. IT IS EXTREMELY WELL SET UP WITH ERNIE BALL 10-46 STRINGS. I WILL TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SHIPPING IS TO THE CONT. US ONLY. SHIPPING TO HAWAII AND ALASKA WILL BE MORE. I WILL SHIP\u00a0INTERNATIONALLY, BUT ONLY THROUGH EBAYS GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. PLEASE MAKE PAYMENT OR CONTACT WITH ME WITHIN 72 HOURS OF WINNING. THANKS AND GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.", "ItemID": "113543375768", "EndTime": "2019-01-17T18:45:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-10T18:45:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1988-CARVIN-USA-DC135-NECK-THRU-PEARL-WHITE-HSS-COIL-TAP-KAHLER-FLOYD-OHSC-/113543375768", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Paris, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135433757688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9ccAAOSwkAxcG8Vz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QaoAAOSwhhlcG8V0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dQIAAOSwpLdcG8V5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DGgAAOSwWlVcG8Vv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/S2UAAOSwcf9cG8V2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1sEAAOSwuQhcG8Vx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vV4AAOSwg5FcG8V3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GGUAAOSwa1hcG8V7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kZUAAOSw1rpcG8WE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ovMAAOSwKphcH9Nw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FLwAAOSwYj9cH9Nu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TSYAAOSw5qdcH9Nx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "40361", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "michaelh571", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2982, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.7, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 600.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 58}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1988 CARVIN USA DC135 NECK THRU PEARL WHITE HSS COIL TAP KAHLER FLOYD OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Carvin"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1988"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["DC-135"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["Guitar and Original Case"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Carvin DC"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 321, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
