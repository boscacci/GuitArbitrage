{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Customized AXL Badwater 1216 LP style electric guitar; solid mahogany body with maple cap and set mahogany neck. All the hardware has been replaced except for the control cavity and switch covers and truss rod cover (missing). The finish is a 3-tone burst done with stain and finished with True Oil, however the sanding job was not the best so there are sanding scratches here and there especially on the back (did not show in pictures). This guitar was built to be a player's guitar not to have a perfect finish. Perhaps, I should call it a project, but I hate to since it plays so well! The tuners are Wilkinson, the pickups are over-wound humbuckers from guitar madness (bought off of ebay- they are hot and sound great!), the controls are wired opposite of a les paul; the bridge volume and tone are on top closer to the bridge and the neck volume and tone are on the bottom. This was done for volume swelling purposes. Also, the bridge volume is a push-on/push-off pot to coil-split the bridge pickup to a single-coil. The neck pickup is not wired as such but can be. Most of the hardware was purchased from GFS including the bone nut. The theme was to black it out, however there are a few brass screws here and there (on the pickup rings, the home-made control cavity and switch covers).The neck is straight, the action and intonation are good, and it plays great! I would describe the neck as a thin profile and is very comfortable. The AXL Badwater guitar is a very under-rated LP style guitar and a great value for the money new or used. I hate to sell this one, but the herd needs thinning out. No case, but will be well packed. Please, ask questions if you have any and thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "192826391125", "EndTime": "2019-02-22T03:22:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T03:22:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/AXL-Badwater-1216-LP-Style-Solid-Mahogany-Set-Neck-Electric-Guitar-/192826391125", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Morehead, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1928263911258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/U5AAAOSwrHtcU3lV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk5/z/VQIAAOSwLNxcU3lj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/RlkAAOSwJ4hcU3l4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/mZQAAOSw~xtcU3mK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMjAw/z/LawAAOSwjmRcU3ma/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/7bAAAOSwa1ZcU3mg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/6BgAAOSwJQVcU3mt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/GYYAAOSwvwRcU3m4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/lzIAAOSwgGhcU3nG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/gawAAOSw8SdcU3nR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/1ZYAAOSwIS9cU3ng/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNTk5/z/LQgAAOSwJStcU3nr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "40351", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "johhny-quest", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 690, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 111.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 111.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 66}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "AXL Badwater 1216 LP Style Solid Mahogany Set Neck Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["AXL"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Badwater 1216"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["3-color burst"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["bridge coil split"]}]}, "HitCount": 140, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 113.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This is a customized AXL Badwater 1216; has all new hardware and electronics except for the control cavity and switch covers.
