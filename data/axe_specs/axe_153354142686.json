Here is the description from there site: The Sadowsky Electric Nylon is a chambered body instrument designed for nylon strings. Developed primarily for the electric guitarist, the neck is thin and comfortable, with just enough extra width to accommodate the nylon strings. An acoustic style bridge graces the beautiful maple top. The custom made Barbera pickup integrated into the bridge saddle is powered by a custom Sadowsky buffer preamp. The instrument lends itself to both pick and fingerstyle techniques and produces exceptional tone when going direct into a board or through a variety of amps and PA systems. It is feedback-free and is suitable for small clubs or large stadium concerts. Electric Nylon players include Earl Klugh, Pat Metheny, Lee Ritenour, Gilberto Gil, Djavan, Daryl Steurmer, John Abercrombie, John Scofield, Mike Stern, Mick Goodrick, and Keith Richards.
