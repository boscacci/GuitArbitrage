{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling a USA made Redmond series Floyd Rose guitar. This guitar is equipped with Floyd Rose's innovative \"Speedloader\" system that allows players to execute dive-bombing effects and abuse the trem arm and have it return to perfect tuning every time. This allows for easy string change since the strings pop in and out of the guitars nut and bridge with only fine tuners to make micro adjustments. The \u2018Speedloader\u2019 tremolo also features the new Floyd Rose Tremstopper that enables the player to block the tremolo system with a simple turn of a screw. This guitar also comes with \"Vintage series pickups\" which are described by Floyd Rose as a high output pickup with extra warmth, they sound excellent! This guitar is no longer in production and retailed for close to $2400 new. This is the lowest price you will find one of these. The guitar comes professionally setup with a nice low action and is effortless to play. The guitar also comes with 4 packs of speedloader string (10-46) Selling to fund a new guitar otherwise would love to keep it. if you have any questions or require additional picture please message me.
