This awesome and funky, English-made guitar is in good condition with just some minor dings, scratches and finish checking. Features three Burns \"Split Sound\" pickups with selector settings including, \"Split Sound\", \"Treble\", \"Jazz\" and \"Wild Dog\". This guitar can go from the extremes of fat bass tones to thin, biting treble tones. The unique \"Split Sound\" setting gives you a deep bass tone for the lower three strings with a much brighter tone on the upper three strings. The innovative tremolo system is very smooth and does a pretty good job of keeping the guitar in tune. This one's got tons of vibe!
