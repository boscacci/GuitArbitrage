{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a 1984 Yamaha SBG3000 White with Kahler with non original case. This instrument is in excellent condition and in perfect working order. There are some light scratches, dings, and a little wear on the back. It is missing the top of one of the tone knobs. There is also some clear coat blushing on the front of the headstock, and some finish checking near the nut. Overall, I would give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 condition. Everything on the guitar is original, aside from the Kahler and the locking nut. There are no cracks, repairs, or major issues. The neck is straight with no issues. The original frets are in excellent condition with minor wear. The non original case works great.
