{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "relisting this guitar > I have delt with a lot of nice people on ebay over the last 19 years so you are bound to get a few bad apples every so often and so I got the loser of the bunch !! you really have to be a sad spiteful manbaby snowflake to leave negative feedback because I decided not to sell to him after he sent me some weird emails after he paid..so I refunded him right away !! I care about every item I sell especially guitars because I am a player and I build custom guitars ! so feel free to check my one negative feedback ! I will wear it as a badge of honor because ebays feedback policy kinda sucks !! for your consideration is a nice ebony Epiphone SG - 400 plays great everything works as it should ..no fret wear .. there are no major chips or scratches on the body .just normal signs of use .. the only modification I made was to the strap button ..it was moved to the top of the horn Tony Iommi style . I do it to all my SG guitars I just find it more balanced .. also the back of the neck was painted when I got the guitar the previous owner decided to sand it ! some people don't like the gloss finish because when your hand gets clammy from playing the gloss tends to make your hand stick and makes it hard to play we all experienced that .. and I did not mind that it was sanded but he took off a little to much paint and I was able to see the scarf joint ! I don't like seeing the scarf joint so I painted it a flat black which takes care of the gloss problem and your hand does not stick !! at the top of the neck I did not want a straight line from gloss to flat so I buffed it to look uneven .. the neck is a soft D shape but not thick or chunky ..the action is low .. and the intonation set .... when I sell a guitar its because I have one to many or I do a custom ! this is a good player it looks great and comes with a nice hard case .. you will not be disappointed ! the pickups are CH HOT bridge and CH 57 neck CH stands for classic humbucker \u2026. I will not lower the price by much if you send a offer ..... 220 is the best I will do", "ItemID": "292877740138", "EndTime": "2018-12-20T00:30:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T17:32:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ebony-Epiphone-SG-G-400-Electric-Guitar-nice-TKL-hard-case-/292877740138", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ormond Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928777401388080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nQQAAOSwAQVcACc6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f~MAAOSwJtJcACdc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Cw0AAOSw8DpcACdx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HvsAAOSwlAFcACeN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2LUAAOSwV0VcACeo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s9gAAOSwkelcACe9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FIUAAOSwkvtcACfY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/C64AAOSw8DpcACfw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/H~MAAOSwlAFcACgW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oLYAAOSw~T9cACgw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PgAAAOSwztVcAChM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qL4AAOSwEONcAChz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32174", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "titan985", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1289, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.1}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 7}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ebony Epiphone SG G-400 Electric Guitar with nice\u00a0 TKL hard case ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 85, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 227.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78587404", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
