{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Welcome! Jackson USA Soloist MAH in transparent green. It is a 2013, serial number U25182. This guitar has hardly been played (maybe 24 hours total, purchased brand new a couple years ago) and has been extremely well kept in its case in a smoke free home. It bends notes with ease and has a very fast neck. You are basically getting a brand new guitar with a much lower price. My loss is your gain. No fret wear at all. No nicks, dings, or dents. The neck pickup is a Seymour Duncan SH-1 59 and the bridge pickup is a DiMarzio Dactivator DP-220. The DiMarzio bridge pickup is very hot, yet warm and extremely full at the same time. It can be tamed down by simply rolling back on the volume knob. A trem block has been installed that can very easily be removed or adjusted based on your preference. Comes with all original hardware. A set of Elixir strings have been installed. One extra tremolo bar in black and 6 extra string lock saddle inserts are included (the small square blocks that pinch the string in the bridge). I purchased these when I noticed one that looked chipped, however it is currently holding the string just fine (either the D or G). In order to put a new one, you just drop it in. It comes with a Jackson hard shell case and will be carefully packaged for shipping. It kills me to have to sell this beauty, but I have realized over time that I much prefer a fixed bridge over a tremolo. Feel free to ask any questions.
