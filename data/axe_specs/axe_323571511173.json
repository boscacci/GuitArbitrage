Inside the trem cavity is clearly shown the order number, date, finish, etc. This Jackson Strat is in very good played condition. Has the Jackson trem and pickups which are original. Nice neck feel to this, not thin like they came to be later in time and not thick like a club. Thick rosewood fretboard, and frets are in excellent condition with ony light wear showing. It has the Stratocaster body shape which was eventually replaced by the DInky shape. It has survived from the 80's to now with only a few light battle scars. The body shows some chips and blemishes as well as play wear but overall looks pretty nice. Some of the marks did not show in the photos. It does present well and looks great from the crowd when on stage. excellent and clean condition. Guitar will ship in the generic case shown in photos, nothing fancy and the interior is coming loose on the lid. Questions? Please ask. Thanks! Texas residents must pay 8 1/4% sales tax.
