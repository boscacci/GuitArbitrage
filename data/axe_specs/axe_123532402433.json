{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage 70s Gibson Original Pickups Embossed Humbucker Univox Guitar Les Paul style with a hard black case. Well packed for shipping! Needs Restoration!!! I know nothing about guitars but I was told that the Gibson pickups are highly collectible. I ended up taking the guitar to a guy who owns a music shop and specializes in guitars. He was kind enough to help me open the Embossed Gibson covers to see if there were original picks up underneath. Indeed they were!!!! I have included pictures of the serial numbers. He did a preliminary check and send they sounded good but told me he would have to do a more extensive check to determine exactly the quality. I was also told this is a Les Paul style guitar and was only made for 2 years in the 70s. It is believed to be from 1972. I was also told something is called a Humbucker but I have know idea if that is accurate or even what it means. This is just what I was told...It has the original silver \u201cbridge? piece that is not attached and is Embossed with Gibson and a serial #. I\u2019m not an expert, so please review all photos before bidding. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions if I can. I\u2019m only excepting returns if the buyer pays the shipping both ways. This guitar is being sold as is because it is in bad shape (was stored in a musty basement) and needs major restoration. The case is also in bad shape! Thanks \ud83d\ude03On Dec-15-18 at 09:26:39 PST, seller added the following information: I wanted to include the response from an inquiry I received in case others were wondering. Hi, Thanks for your interest. As I stated in the listing I don't know much but will answer best I can. First, I asked the guy from the music store if the neck is straight (because a friend who knows guitars told me to ask) Anyway, he said it appears straight but you apparently don't really know until you string it. There is defiantly mold/mildew in the case. It wasn't stored properly. I do not see signs of it on or in the guitar. The question about the screws and strings is probably a no...but again I don't know what I'm looking at. There is no printing on the case. The guy at the music store believed it to be original. The latches are chrome with some rusting. The case is cracked in one spot. Thanks so much for you inquiry and have a very happy holiday!", "ItemID": "123532402433", "EndTime": "2018-12-17T21:41:44.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T21:41:44.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-70s-Gibson-Original-Pickups-Embossed-Humbucker-Univox-Guitar-Les-Paul-/123532402433", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Princeton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235324024338080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ5NFgxNjAw/z/hL0AAOSwEGpb6MsA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2dEAAOSwKSlcCuRw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE1NFgxNjAw/z/GgIAAOSwOsFcCuRy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0NFgxNjAw/z/elYAAOSwKMNb6MsD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUyMFgxNjAw/z/zWkAAOSwcs1b6MsS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kbUAAOSwQFNb6MsI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EsgAAOSwPVFcC7~Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDg0/z/3RgAAOSw8PJb6MsJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-bAAAOSwezRb6MsG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTI2/z/KB8AAOSwE8Vb6MsQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tw0AAOSwZltb6MsN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PeIAAOSwoZJb6MsU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08540", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kdherwig", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1130, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 13, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 635.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 635.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 10}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 70s Gibson Original Pickups Embossed Humbucker Univox Guitar Les Paul", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 1550, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=12685880", "StoreName": "kdherwig"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 645.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Original pickups underneath embossed Gibson Patent!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
