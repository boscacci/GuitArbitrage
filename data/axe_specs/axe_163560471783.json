{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Offered here is my custom \"Vince Gill\" model Stratocaster that I put together myself from all top-of-the-line components. I built it a few months ago and it is in mint condition. This is the sixth or seventh guitar I have built. Most are being played by my Ebay customers all over the country. As stated earlier, this is a replica of the Stratocaster I've seen Vince Gill play for many years. I special ordered the all Black alder vintage Stratocaster body from Warmoth, which is a world-renowned guitar body and neck builder; and had it routed for a 9 volt battery box, which is required for the EMG active pickups Vince has in his Strat. The red tortoise pickguard loaded with the Vince Gill EMG pickups is the VG20, directly from EMG. You can check out the specs. on EMG's website. he maple neck is an authentic Fender MIM with a beautiful rosewood fingerboard. It has Schaller \"F\" logo locking tuners. The bridge is an authentic Fender vintage Eric Clapton model that has black Graph Tech Tusq XL saddles I installed. It plays and sounds like a dream. The EMG single coils are dead silent. There is easily well over a thousand bucks involved in putting this instrument together. You won't find a better quality or more meticulously crafted strat at twice the price. It also comes with a tolex hardshell case. Why am I letting it go? I have to thin the herd to make room for other projects; and I have two other hand-built \"Fender\" guitars. Check my feedback and bid with confidence. No international bidders, please. No exceptions - don't ask. I only ship within the U.S. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "163560471783", "EndTime": "2019-03-02T02:30:57.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-23T02:30:57.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-Built-Vince-Gill-Stratocaster-Black-w-Rosewod-Fingerboard-Mint-/163560471783", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Allen Park, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635604717838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O7gAAOSwk~VcZ2za/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OKYAAOSwJItcZ2zr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XrsAAOSw0vZcZ20C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mzYAAOSw-R5cZ20z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dpAAAOSwUDZcZ20e/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fxIAAOSw9bpcZ2y5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dXAAAOSwh0NcZ2y8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XWQAAOSwHQxcZ2y-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vNcAAOSw6HJcZ2zC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/5xAAAOSwzd5cZ2zH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "48101", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "golfsnobdennis", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2205, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 59}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom Built \"Vince Gill\" Stratocaster - Black w/Rosewod Fingerboard.
