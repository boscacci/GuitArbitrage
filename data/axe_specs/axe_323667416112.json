{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Jackson RX10D Rhoads V Project Guitar MIJ 1996. Condition is Used. 1996 Made in Japan Red flame maple top Poplar body 22 fret 25.5\" scale Amazing rosewood fretboard. Neck is brand new, never used. Was damaged in shipping and I picked it up for this project. The very tip was chipped off and reglued. I planned on sanding and fixing, but it's not too noticeable so I left it. Upper wing has a decent chunk missing. I'm not the greatest at fixing wood, so i will leave that to someone who knows what they're doing. Finish is in decent shape minus the pictured damage. The switch is bad so a new one is included. Comes with new tuners(missing one mount screw), neck plate and screws, JT580 bridge, input jack, and the volume pot and new knob. Has 3 tremolo springs and the spring claw is still intact. Comes with control cover. Doesnt include th tremolo cavity cover. Does not have strap buttons, pickups, or mount rings. All the ground wires are still intact. This is a decently rare guitar in the states and would make an awesome project, I simply don't have the time to finish it. Does not have a case and will be shipped with the neck and body separated but in same box. Will ship USPS Priority Mail. Insured.
