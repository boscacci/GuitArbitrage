{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This has been my go-to guitar when I needed a Strat sound & feel. So much so, that when I had to decided between my USA Strat and this one, I got rid of the Strat. The time has come for me to really thin out the guitars so this one will also soon have a new owner.The action is great and the intonation is right on. It's had a setup. The frets are good and the sound is nice with lots of choices with those 3 pickups. I can't be sure but I've always figured this was made in the 90's.It has some dings but is in really nice shape overall. All the dings are visible in the photos.The pictures were taken in front of windows, so there are lots of reflections, but no scrapes, etc or finish vlemishes. It comes with a quality gig bag as shown. Everything works.The photos constitute part of the description. Look carefully. PayPal is welcomed when shipped to verified addresses.
