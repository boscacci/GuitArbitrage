{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "EPIPHONE LES PAUL STANDARD 2010- GLOSS BLACK- NICE COND, PLAYS & SOUNDS GREAT! the guitar was made in 2010 and has been stamped used on the headstock with part of the serial number removed from the factory- there is no issues with the guitar and it is in really good condition I would say and 8.5 out of 10. It has a few minor scratches and scuffs and a section along the neck where there are some more significant scratches that are visible. The rest of the guitar is in very good condition it is not been abused in any way and there are no cracks or breaks or chips in the finish except a very small spot on the face of the headstock where the lacquer has been damaged, but can be easily touched up. There are also two small holes where the pickguard has been removed- one on the face of the guitar and one on the side of the guitar which would be easily touched up but they are barely noticeable as is. The fingerboard has been cleaned, then conditioned with Dunlop lemon oil, the frets have been polished and new Ernie Ball 10-46 nickel wound strings have the been installed. Very little fret wear, the guitar has not been played much. The guitar has been intonated and action set & ready to go! It plays great and sounds great! The zebra coil humbucker pickups deliver the goods! They'll play everything from blues to hard rock to crunchy metal- This guitar can do it all! The thick slab mahogany body with maple top & mahogany neck with rosewood fingerboard and 22 jumbo frets is a classic tonewood combination and will deliver that thick mid-range grind that you need for today's modern rock! It'll really cut through the mix and shake the ground as it vibrates the sonic energy through your amplifier with a set neck design.All the controls function as they should and there's no problems with the tuning stability with the sealed chrome Grover tuners and tune-o-matic bridge and tailpiece assembly. I'll pack the Les Paul well and ship USPS w/ Tracking & Insurance- International Buyers Welcome.", "ItemID": "223418696364", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T14:40:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-24T08:33:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EPIPHONE-LES-PAUL-STANDARD-2010-GLOSS-BLACK-NICE-COND-PLAYS-SOUNDS-GREAT-/223418696364", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Seattle, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2234186963648080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g0cAAOSws3dcck2x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L64AAOSw4sxcck~J/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODA3WDE1NTI=/z/maoAAOSwUYhcck5L/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x-EAAOSwVKhcck7F/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TNsAAOSwY8Ncck2u/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QWsAAOSwCrtcck5m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xwEAAOSwlLdcck2q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fNgAAOSwNZxcck9J/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RpIAAOSwUPlcck58/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BCwAAOSwVVlcck6x/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9uYAAOSw2Nhcck2k/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dqUAAOSwA~5cck7y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98188", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "skorpiusx", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1155, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 219.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 219.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 60}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EPIPHONE LES PAUL STANDARD 2010- GLOSS BLACK- NICE COND, PLAYS, SOUNDS GREAT!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 181, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
