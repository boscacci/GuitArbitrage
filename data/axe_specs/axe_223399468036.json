{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1987 Fender Stratocaster Strat Plus, Lake Placid Blue, Maple Neck/Fretboard, Excellent Condition! The Fender Strat Plus was originally released in 1987 as an upgraded American Standard Stratocaster, in particular boasting Lace Sensor Gold pickups, locking tuners, anda roller nut. If you're looking for a Stratocaster that offers more versatility and tuning stability than an American Standard, a Strat Plus might be the perfect guitar for you. I am the original owner, buying this guitar new in 1987. It is in excellent condition. It has been well taken care of for 32 years. Picking it up, even after months of not playing, it stays in tune. There are two small chips through the finish, and one ding on top, as shown in pics. The guitar has great action, and the neck is straight. Lower frets show some wear, as pictured, but have lots of life left. This Strat Plus comes with a roller nut, locking tuners and standard tremolo bridge. This guitar looks, sounds and plays great, and has never been gigged.

On Feb-19-19 at 08:58:42 PST, seller added the following information: There are no cracks near the neck pocket, or anywhere on the instrument, save some fine vertical checking lines on the front and back. They are not deep or significant, almost unnoticeable. Nor is there any cracking of the finish. Pretty typical of a 30+ year old instrument. The neck is very straight, and the truss rod is fully functional.", "ItemID": "223399468036", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T02:34:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T02:34:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1987-Fender-Stratocaster-Strat-Plus-Original-Lake-Placid-Blue-Maple-Excellent-/223399468036", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fort Collins, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2233994680368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDk0/z/JsEAAOSwwrlcag0i/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzM5WDE2MDA=/z/8vgAAOSwXCVcag2J/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY1WDE2MDA=/z/LL0AAOSwmThcag2S/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-poAAOSwcY5cag2f/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTI3/z/1PUAAOSwcag44/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2ODI=/z/eisAAOSwtM9cag47/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3ODE=/z/rzEAAOSwuDFcag4-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4N1gxNjAw/z/KKkAAOSwOttcag5w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM2M1gxNjAw/z/mzEAAOSwbRNcag53/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MDU=/z/vS8AAOSwt6hcag57/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NlgxNjAw/z/JsYAAOSwGMFcag7U/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDE2MDA=/z/w7EAAOSwgW9cahCo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80525", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bobaloo1711", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 832, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1310.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "f***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5622}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1987 Fender Stratocaster Strat Plus Original Lake Placid Blue Maple Excellent!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Strat Plus"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Lake Placid Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 435, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1335.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
