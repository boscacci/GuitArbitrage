{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1993 Fender USA Strat Plus Deluxe Guitar, Crimson Burst finish. Beautiful finish, with the Lace Sensor pickups, wired in the custom shop. Red, Silver, and Blue models. TBX tone control, and high end electronics used throughout. The Deluxe American 2 point tremolo, and Schaller locking tuners keep this in tune, and can get pretty wild when needed. Wilkinson roller nut was standard on this, allowing a super smooth feel when using the tremolo. 22 fret maple neck with jumbo frets with some fret wear, but still play and feel good. The edges of the neck, has some lacquer that has worn off, but gives it a great broken in feel. Some belt buckle rash, and some scratches on the guitar, nothing major. Very good shape for being 25 years old. This was the highest end Strat available at the time, Outside of the custom shop. Plays and sounds like it should. Pictured with no strings, but will be strung up with 42-9 Ernie Balls. You will need to set up to your preference. Comes with a nice Lightweight case, and packed very well. Strat Plus Deluxe Model.The Strat Plus was followed by the Strat Plus Deluxe of 1989, the same guitar except for a Blue Lace Sensor in the neck, a Silver Lace Sensor in the middle, a Red Lace Sensor in the bridge and an optional Fender/Floyd Rose locking bridge.During the first two years of production, the Strat Plus Deluxe guitar came with a Gold Lace Sensor in the neck position, a Silver Lace Sensor in the middle position and a Blue Lace Sensor in the bridge. It also featured an American 2-point tremolo, with the Deluxe pop-in bridge becoming a common option between 1989 and 1993.
