{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Huge smoldering skull and cross bones with dozens of tiny skull and cross bones all along the sides. Professionally painted by a local artist. About 100hrs of art work. A Bill Lawrence custom made Dimebag Darrell rear pick up. Custom chrome knobs with pearl inlays & a 3-way chrome Fat Boy switch. Guitar Customized by Joe Buscema of Jeez Guitars Tampa, FL. 1 of a kind. I originally had it customized to start playing out gigs with it so I had a cool looking guitar on Stage however seeing how great it turned out I was afraid to Nick it up going from Club to club with it so it's just remained in my house not played very much as to keep it as pristine as possible. This guitar would be great for playing out or for a collector I think this guitar will look awesome in a glass case and hung on a wall in a rock Club. If this guitar was played by a famous musician I can picture it hanging up at the Hard Rock Cafe.", "ItemID": "132931619027", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T01:55:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-27T05:23:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dean-Custom-electric-guitar-/132931619027", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Greensburg, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329316190278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMDk5/z/bo0AAOSwiOZcLsrD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/cvEAAOSw2zRcLsrO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzEwWDEwMDE=/z/WWwAAOSwpzRcTUI~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVg5MzU=/z/Mw4AAOSwkERcLsrQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjcy/z/IdIAAOSws6dcLsrU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ufgAAOSwsPNcLsr0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMDk5/z/TRQAAOSwvwRcLtER/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "47240", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "sixxdemon66", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 339, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***3", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 112}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Dean Custom electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Dean"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1998"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup", "custum paint job"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 103, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
