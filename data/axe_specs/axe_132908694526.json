{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for SALE is a USED 2010 Fender American Special Telecaster and Hard Shell Case Serial No. 10 041031 Made in the USA See photos - great playing telecaster - minor scuffs & scratches from normal use. There is a \"nick\" on the backside of the guitar. Action is very low. The pearl pickguard is not original.A Fender Hardshell Case is included with this auction. I'm selling this guitar for Grammy winning guitarist, Jim Seales. He's one of the founding members of the American Country group from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, \"Shenandoah\" (Lead guitarist and backing vocals) and he retired in 2014.His personal remarks regarding this guitar: \"2010 American Special Telecaster - one of the best reviewed Telecasters in the last several years for good reason. I took this American Made guitar in on trade, I'm not a Tele player - If I was I would KEEP this! The smooth satin finished C profile neck and Jumbo Frets with a 9.5 radius make for easy bends and great sustain ... the action on this guitar is just plain YES. The previous owner made some changes- most I think add to the guitar. Wilkinson Compensated brass saddles for more accurate intonation and sustain, Vintage Fender Telecaster Bridge Plate with Ashtray Cover. Duncan Stack in the bridge just sounds amazing and coupled with the TV Jones classic neck make a great and very quiet combo. Also has Fender's \"Greasebucket\" tone control - when it's rolled down it reduces the hight frequencies but doesn't add bass. It's a good feature. This is not the original pick guard and I assume it was used to accommodate the TV Jones and save the original guard. Love the pearl finish but the cut around the vintage bridge plate is a little rough - if I was keeping it I'd take it off and smooth it out. (see pics) Really a good American Made guitar with smooth controls and solid hardware and factory hard shell case. \" Feel free to email me if you have any other questions or need more pictures.
