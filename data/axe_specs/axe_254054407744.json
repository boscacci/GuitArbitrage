{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Note, when comparing this price, this item includes a very fine condition basically the new Knox Audio hard case shown. A large online / brick and mortar guitar retailer has three of these for sale in the Fender model versus the Squier, the cheapest of which is $549 and that does not include as nice a case as this one. Here is a Fender Squier Vintage Modified '72 Thinline Telecaster Electric Guitar w Case with Ash body and Maple neck, in excellent used condition. When I got it, the original white pickguard was cracked, so I replaced that with an aged pearloid pickguard from StratoSphere. It looks way better, IMHO; more like it really was from '72 with its understated amber patina... Some say these compare to the American made model. This is from the Fender Indonesia plant, I would say it is better. I set the intonation and set the action and relief to Stew Mac specifications Here are the Electric guitar Action and Relief setting specifications I use from Stew Mac: Electric guitar @1st fret Treble E .25 mmElectric guitar @ 1st fret Bass E .6 mmElectric guitar @12th fret Treble E 1.6 mmElectric guitar @12th fret Bass E 2 mm Electric guitar Relief: @ 8th fret .025mm (Relief is the very small amount (half the thickness of a typical piece of paper) of concavity placed in the neck, measured at the 8th fret with a straight edge (or guitar string with a capo) between the first fret and the last) Great tone out of the non-splittable Humbuckers. No fret buzz anywhere up and down the neck. It is a rock solid semi-hollow body that you will love. The shipping may seem high but that is just the cost of the carrier, no handlng or processing fees added. Don't delay, someone will get this great playing guitar, make sure it is you or get it for a friend or family member, as a gift. I'd like to move this guitar; this listing is set to reject low-ball offers, so make something good happen with a reasonable offer. Satisfaction guaranteed.
