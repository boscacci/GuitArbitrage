{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Line 6 Variax 700 Acoustic Year Built : 2006 This guitar is a blast to play. Very nice condition. If you are looking at this you may already be familiar with its functionality. For, now let me tell you my experience and history with the guitar. I bought it used around 2010. I bought it because I had played one in GC and had so much fun with it - but didn't want to spend the money on new. Eventually I purchased this one on ebay and have owned it since. Never been gigged. Always in my home as I'm a hobbyist. I enjoyed it for the different acoustic modelling features. I enjoyed looping with various acoustic models - especially the 12 string. But what I really like about the guitar is the build quality. It's a Korean made guitar. The only one I have in my collection. Mostly I buy US made acoustics like Guild and I also play a Fender Deluxe Tele. So, I am a little picky to be honest. The original build quality on this Variax is great. I love the neck. The thing plays fast and will NOT feedback, Its like having a set of acoustics that play like an electric. The neck has a Les Paul like feel in my opinion. Truth be told - no it does not sound as good as the high quality acoustics that it attempts to model. But it does sound really good and if I were gigging there is no doubt I would take this guitar above my genuine acoustics. Like I said it will not feed back so you can play loud to compete with the other instruments. It is versatile, so another guitar is only a dial change away. All the guitar models work. The alternate tuning feature - I am honestly not so sure how well they work - haven't had much luck playing with that. My thinking is that if you have the Line 6 Monkey interface, you should probably re-flash the guitar to bring it all up to date software-wise. I haven't had much luck with alternate tuning feature - but I also haven't had the need to goof with it too much. Includes XPS direct box, cable, and original soft case - all in great condition. Very good condition - no noteworthy dings or scratches. Here's a link to check out the guitar functionality if you are not familiar with the Variax: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTUxZg2rlAk. I half want to keep this as a collectors piece as they are no longer made. But, I have too many guitars already and I'm crossing over into Jazz currently, so I need to make room for another :) Questions are welcomed. Amended since first post: I added four pictures. I did notice 2 small marks on the surface that probably should be called out. The first is just above the bridge and is a tiny dot of discoloration. The second mark it near the binding to the right of the bridge when facing the guitar. This one actually looks like a small ding about 1/3 the size of a pencil eraser head. I must have bumped it somewhere along the line. The third and fourth picture is of the pedal which comes with the guitar.", "ItemID": "283318947102", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T17:03:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-28T00:33:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/LINE6-VARIAX-ACOUSTIC-700-Electric-Acoustic-Guitar-Soft-Case-/283318947102", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Hamburg, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833189471028080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/H~IAAOSwEGBcJTtn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ1N1g2NjA=/z/6dwAAOSw8q5cJTuj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA3MVgxNjAw/z/Db0AAOSwTbxcJTtl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/JFQAAOSwHOZcJTtl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/MHMAAOSwi1lcJTtm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/mMgAAOSw-yJcJTtm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/BMEAAOSwG49cJTtm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcx/z/hxIAAOSwG1JcJTtp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Ir0AAOSwhhlcJsQk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/QxoAAOSwO-pcJsQk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc5WDYyNg==/z/XGAAAOSwuNNcJsfu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODYxWDUwMA==/z/AtgAAOSwW9NcJsfa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "14075", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tbraun55", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 30, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 534}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "LINE6 VARIAX ACOUSTIC 700 Electric Acoustic Guitar with Soft Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["LINE6"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["VARIAX ACOUSTIC 700"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Producte", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Style", "Value": ["Electric Acoustic Guitar"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modified item", "Value": ["No"]}]}, "HitCount": 354, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
