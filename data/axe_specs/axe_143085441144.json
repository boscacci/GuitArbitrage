{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE 1997 Parker Fly Deluxe Ser.# 032026B P. This is the original Fly model built by Ken Parker (pre \u2013 US Music Corp). I am the original owner and it has lived exclusively in my studio since. It has all original components and hasn\u2019t been modified in any way. It has DiMarzio pickups (tap-able for single coil) and Fishman piezos in the bridge. The pickups can be combined and mixed. The frets are in perfect condition and are the smoothest of any guitar ever (like the strings are on bearings). When properly intonated for the gauge strings, it is also the most in-tune guitar (any chord, anywhere on the neck) I\u2019ve ever played (all the way to the 24th fret). The neck is super fast and smooth. Currently it has Dunlop Strap-loks installed but the original strap buttons and screws are included. It has 9V active electronics, Parker locking whammy bar system (can do things no other can and is tension-adjustable with the friction knob visible in the body), incredibly light (4.5 lbs.), amazingly resonant poplar/basswood carved body and neck, carbon exoskeleton, locking Sperzel machine heads, stereo output (so you can route the magnetic and piezo pickups to different amps if desired) and a beautiful emerald green finish. It comes with the complete set of adjustment wrenches, an alternate claw spring for the whammy (for different gauge strings), the owners manual and the original Parker gig bag. It is in perfect playing condition with the exception that the tone control needs to be reconnected to the wiring harness (I am moving very soon and haven\u2019t had the time to attend to it). It is also missing the rubber volume control knob. I removed it to lessen accidental contact while playing and was unable to locate it (possibly it\u2019s with other accessories that I\u2019ve already moved across the country). It's a common type knob. There are also a couple of small nicks at the end of the headstock (see photo). Aside from that it is in excellent condition and plays/sounds like new. This will ship only within the United States.", "ItemID": "143085441144", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T01:01:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-09T17:21:45.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1997-Parker-Fly-Deluxe-Guitar-/143085441144", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "State College, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430854411448080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2u8AAOSwyodb8t5p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDkw/z/qcIAAOSwfcNb8t-I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/SG4AAOSwaepb8t4K/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YeIAAOSwUfVb8t6c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/EMUAAOSw6jJb8t6p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/w0AAAOSw~odb8t63/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gyIAAOSw9~Rb8t7Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YyoAAOSwolpb8t4q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/w4kAAOSw8Mxb8t7o/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9G8AAOSwqs1b8t71/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CmwAAOSwIUVb8t86/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "16801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pbarsom", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 99, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 0.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1700.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1437}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1997 Parker Fly Deluxe Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Parker Guitars"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Fly Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 38, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1725.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
