{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This was purchased brand-new direct from Rivolta last year right after they were released. I fitted a USA Bigsby B5 to it using a VibroMate, so no modifications, holes drilled, etc. The original stop-bar tail and studs and all the associated VibroMate extras are in the case. You can change it back to a stop-bar any time you change strings, it only takes about five minutes. Also, the stock tune-o-matic bridge has nylon saddles, like a '60s Gibson, and it works really well with the Bigsby.One of the coolest things about this guitar (besides how cool it looks and the amazing fit and finish quality) is the switching. I've had several three pickup guitars (Ric, Gibson, Vox, Valco, etc) and this is the best switching set-up I have ever seen. Every possible option is available, even more than the Strat schematic which was my favorite before I owned this guitar. The upper switch is exactly like a standard two pickup selector, it controls Neck/Both/Bridge; so only the the two outer pickups. The lower switch focuses on the middle pickup and it's up/mid/down positions are Middle Only/Middle Added/Middle Off. Then it's just Volume and Tone. Simple but super effective. The Mondata is designed by Dennis Fano. To me, it's a Jazzmaster meets a Firebird. The offset body is double-bound, has a nice German carve on the front and a subtle contour where your arm meets the top of the body. The raised center portion is inspired by the Firebird, but Fano flares it out towards the tail end of the body which is a unique take. The Laguna Blue is gorgeous and nearly flawless. The neck has large pearl inlays that look amazing. The fret work is top-notch, no issues there. The nut could have been shaped and polished a bit more, but functionally it is good, just an old-school appearance comment.These pickups sound great. They are mini humbuckers without visible pole pieces, so exactly like a (reverse) firebird. They sound meaty but very articulate. They cut through the mix with my band and sound consistent all the different amps I've used. When I got the guitar I thought right away that I might swap out the pickups to some Soapbar P-90s, but I never thought about it again once I heard the Minis.The original case is in good shape with just a couple of minor scuffs. The keys and truss rod allen wrench are included.Great guitar that cost $1,300 new, and the VibroMate and Bigsby are another $200, so this prices is a steal.", "ItemID": "312492567626", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T13:52:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T19:57:28.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Rivolta-Mondata-fans-guitar-jazz-master-meets-firebird-retro-bigsby-laguna-blue-/312492567626", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Newman, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3124925676268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/fsoAAOSwLi1cbbAx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/KJQAAOSwjXZcbbBL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/jocAAOSwWB5cbbBg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/C5oAAOSwHxxcbbBn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/QBAAAOSwmvtcbbCj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/cGYAAOSweZ9cbbB4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/4zEAAOSwJBhcbbCi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/hakAAOSwToZcbbC5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/~jYAAOSwR2ZcbbC0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/3~gAAOSwzMlcbbC0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA1OVgxNjAw/z/SlsAAOSwLMRcbbC3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "61942", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "punkrockpunkrock", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2591, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.6}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 999.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 999.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 123}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Rivolta Mondata fans guitar jazz master meets firebird retro bigsby laguna blue", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Rivolta"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["mondata"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 53, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=39396091", "StoreName": "Luv n Chaos"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
