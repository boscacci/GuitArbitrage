{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a vintage electric guitar. I bought this one a couple years ago and have never set it up so it\u2019s time to pass it on. It looks to me like a guitar built by either Bill Gruggett or Bob Venn. I own three other Gruggett\u2019s and the body shape of this one is identical to one of the others. The hand made wooden pickups are also identical. Other features like the 6 degree fingerboard radius and highly figured maple board and neck joint are also very much like Bills guitars. A friend of mine thought it looked like it could have been made in the 70\u2019s by Bob Venn although I have no first hand knowledge of his guitars. It is unmarked. It\u2019s a very cool guitar with a nice straight neck and working rod but will need a little fret work. The ends are sharp and the frets need leveling and crowning. There is no control cavity plate and there is no output jack hooked up. It will be an awesome guitar when fixed up. Comes in it\u2019s original custom made case. Selling with no reserve. I am always happy to accept returns if an item is not as described. I ask that you please study the photos and contact me with any questions. I have been selling on ebay for 20 years with 100% positive feedback so bid with confidence.", "ItemID": "283376608475", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T20:08:10.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-12T20:08:10.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Custom-Made-Electric-Guitar-Bill-Gruggett-Bob-Venn-/283376608475", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chilmark, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833766084758080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c~4AAOSwBKBcYyVb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uaAAAOSw5E1cYyVo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kM8AAOSwCdtcYyVy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ubUAAOSw5E1cYyV8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pQUAAOSwtxtcYyWE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/u6AAAOSwbRNcYyWM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RrIAAOSwdfVcYyWU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Z34AAOSwobJcYyWg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qewAAOSwTgJcYyWq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/u-kAAOSwbRNcYyW7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bJUAAOSw~LpcYyXD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wdoAAOSwndBcYyXM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "02535", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "weazy2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5408, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.8, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 27, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 202.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "5***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 162}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Custom Made Electric Guitar.
