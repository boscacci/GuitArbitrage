{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a bit of an unusual model, as it is Epiphone branded, but was made in the Gibson USA factory in 1989. It has a Gibson format serial number, and is stamped \"Made in the U.S.A\". This is a really sweet guitar, and I have to admit I am a bit on the fence about selling - it plays and sounds fantastic. There is some fretwear in the \"cowboy chords\" area in the first 3-4 frets, some divots starting there - but there is plenty of life left in the frets. There are a few minor scrapes here and there as this is a 30 year old guitar, but one thing I want to be sure to mention is there is significant finish checking on the body of this guitar. I believe this to be a nitrocellulose lacquer finish, and as you may know sudden temperature changes can these sort of finish checks or cracks. The are over a lot of the body - I just wanted to make this clear. Also worth pointing out is I do not have the original tremolo arm. I have a chrome one that does not match that I will include - it does not screw all the way on, and I suspect the threads are not the same type/size so I have never forced it. I am much of a tremolo user, so I have left it off the guitar - but I'll include it in case it is helpful tot he buyer. The original hard case is included, and all the latches and hinges as well as the handle are working. It does have some rips and tears in the tolex as you can see, but works fine to protect the guitar. I only want to ship to lower 48 USA states. I don't want to sell outside of America.
