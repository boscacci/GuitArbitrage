{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello, You are bidding on an Epiphone Les Paul Jr. Limited Edition Double-Cutaway body with P-90 Pickup. I believe this one was manufactured in Korea circa 1997. These models are becoming pretty hard to find, not many were made, they were manufactured for a few years and were available in this color (Cherry) and I believe TV Yellow. They are real nice playing guitars if you can find one. The necks on these have a nice profile and the factory equipped P-90 pickup sounds bright! This one is pretty clean for it's age but upon close inspection has a few small dings on it's body and headstock. Some light scratches on the body noticeable depending on the light, the neck is nice and straight with just a touch of noticeable fretwear on the first few frets. The truss rod adjusts nicely, it is missing the truss cover however. It has been nicely detailed and set-up. Looks and plays great! If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thank You", "ItemID": "292887679570", "EndTime": "2018-12-31T07:52:13.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T07:52:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/EPIPHONE-LES-PAUL-JUNIOR-GIBSON-DOUBLE-CUT-DC-LIMITED-EDITION-P-90-RARE-/292887679570", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Sterling Heights, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928876795708080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTE=/z/vmgAAOSwrZBcIIjD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2MjE=/z/vM4AAOSwIsdcIIi6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjIw/z/vSIAAOSw1IhcIIj3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzcw/z/orgAAOSwkHFcIIkA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTM0/z/1CUAAOSw259cIIkK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NTQ=/z/~WIAAOSwEphcIIjL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUxMFgxNjAw/z/raQAAOSw1jpcIIjf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExOVg5ODc=/z/-AoAAOSwuNNcIIjW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jTgAAOSw6jJcIIjp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUwOVgxNjAw/z/yuoAAOSwO7dcIIkV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3NTg=/z/7HUAAOSwx-lcIIk-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "48314", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "low_book", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 763, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.38, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.38, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***_", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 189}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "EPIPHONE \"LES PAUL\" JUNIOR BY GIBSON \"DOUBLE-CUT\" DC \"LIMITED EDITION\" P-90 RARE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone By Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Junior DC"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Dark Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["P-90 Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 596, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 227.88, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used but not abused, has a few bb sized dings on the body, a few dings on the edge of the headstock.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
