{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Selling my gorgeous lefty Fender Custom Shop '69 Stratocaster Relic.Definitely the best sounding and playing Strat I've owned (I've had a bunch of them), and it's all in perfect condition.This one plays like a dream and just sings... it is vintage voiced, quite mellow sounding, not harsh or high output, but woody. As you can see from the pics, all the bits come with it (case, docs, strap, etc), so it's the full package, and destined to be collectible due to the rarity of this model, especially in a lefty. Happy to ship this anywhere in Europe or North America, tracked and insured with either UPS or Fedex. For not much more than the price of a new US Standard Strat, you can have this handmade Custom Shop beauty. Open to part-ex offers also, I'm selling this to fund a Les Paul Custom (lefty obvs), so would consider a trade. Any questions, let me know. Spec copy and pasted below... :-) When you talk about Stratocasters and Sound, this is the one. You cannot come closer to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s legendary Woodstock Strat than with this one.
