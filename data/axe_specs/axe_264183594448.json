{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2012 Dean Select Cadillac: Every once in a while a guitar comes along that surprises you. This guitar not only looks great but plays and sounds great too and it won't break the bank. It has a killer Quilt Maple top, gold hardware that shows typical wear, Grover tuners and Zebra coil pickups. It has just been set up with 10 gauge strings and plays without issue and shows just a hint of fret wear. A few tiny dings on the back, otherwise clean. This guitar ships in the Levis gig bag as shown. Guitars can experience slight changes in shipping that may require minor adjustments. In addition, I can not predict how you like your guitar set up. Be advised that minor adjustments or a set-up to your liking may be required and the costs associated with these adjustments should be expected.Under no circumstances will I be responsible for any shipping charges, send or return, unless this item is damaged in shipping.
