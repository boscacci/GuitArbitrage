The SCT-607B starts with a rather traditional shape, but then takes an abrupt turn into one of the most powerful guitars available for contemporary music styles. It's a seven-string guitar, with neck-thru-body construction at 27\" baritone scale. That means this instrument can handle extremely low tunings, while still maintaining the string tension needed for expressive playing and excellent tones. It offers a comfortable alder body and a three-piece maple neck, with an unadorned ebony fingerboard. Components on the LTD SCT-607B include a TonePros locking TOM bridge with string-thru-body design for excellent sustain, and a pair of versatile Fishman Fluence SRC Signature active pickups. Each pickup has multiple voicings; use the push-pull control on the volume knob to select the one you want. On the middle alnico pickup, push down for \u201cModern Active\u201d tone or pull up for \u201cModern Passive Attack\u201d. On the bridge ceramic pickup, push down for \u201cModern Passive Attack\u201d tone or pull up for \u201cModern Active\u201d voicing.
