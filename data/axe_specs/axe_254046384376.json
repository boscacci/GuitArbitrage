Classic RG performance The Ibanez RG series of guitars has remained a standard in rock music for the last couple of decades, thanks to the effortless playability of its Wizard III neck. Switching between aggressive rhythm playing and wild lead lines is effortless on this slim-profile neck. And the RG body style's aggressive lines strike an imposing look onstage while being expertly contoured for a comfortable playing experience. Guitarists here at Sweetwater love the feel and playability of Ibanez's RG guitars. You will too! Fixed bridge stability for rock-solid tuning The Ibanez RG421PB sports a fixed bridge, which gives the peace of mind that comes from rock-solid tuning stability. From standard to lowered tunings, your guitar's pitch will remain more stable, and the string tension will feel more consistent. Also, when you change tunings on the fly, they will be ready to go without messing with the tremolo or loosening locking nuts. Many also attribute greatly increased sustain and a fatter overall tone to the way hardtail bridges transfer the string's energy directly to the RG421PB's body. Big tonal range With two Quantum humbucking pickups and 3-way switching, you'll be able to shape your tone any way you like on the RG421PB. The Quantum hum-buckers offer plenty of punch and output to drive your favorite amplifiers or distortion stompboxes. But their clear top end and full lows allow them to sound fantastic throughout a wide variety of additional styles. Although the Ibanez RG will forever be known as a rock guitar, the RG421PB's fast playability, extreme comfort, and tonal variety make it a great guitar for a whole lot more.", "ItemID": "254046384376", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T23:55:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-30T22:55:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-RG421PB-Sapphire-Blue-Flat-MINT-IF-NO-ONE-BUYS-TODAY-AM-KEEPING-/254046384376", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Frisco, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540463843768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1bsAAOSwO6NcKUnx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QGoAAOSw3BJcKUnx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/x50AAOSwF5VcKUnz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zU8AAOSwRfxcKUnz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6BcAAOSwhY9cKUnz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xOsAAOSwqLRcKUn0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SUQAAOSw9apcKUny/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZMgAAOSwc6ZcKUnx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xMcAAOSwi7VcKUnx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RccAAOSw5i5cKUnx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/51kAAOSwo1lcKUnx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "75033", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mah540i6", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 114, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 95.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 175.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 485}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez RG421PB-Sapphire Blue Flat - \u201cMINT\u201d IF NO-ONE BUYS TODAY, I AM KEEPING IT", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RG421PB"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ibanez RG"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["RG421PB"]}]}, "HitCount": 241, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
