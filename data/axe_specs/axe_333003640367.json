{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hey Folks, I carved the body of this guitar with hand chisels from a single solid piece of alder and it has undergone three layers of dark stain and polyurethane. it's got a texture to it because it's not made by machine but carved by hand, the geometry is good. It has a nice tone and is ready to play, despite some minor playwear. The neck is a good aftermarket neck made of maple with a rosewood fretboard. I refretted the whole thing and the intonation is good. it has many genuine fender parts, like the pickups (fender 59's) and the control pots and jack. It's an ordinary telecaster type guitar, it is ready to play live!Please feel free to message me if you have questions.I just want to sell it to someone who will play it with some regularity and enjoy it for what it is! all the proceeds from this sale are going to help pay off my student loan debt. I don't have a case for this guitar but I can ship it fast and safely. Thank you. Best, Rudy Returns? I dont offer returns usually because the shipping is so much on these instruments, nearly 100USD to go across the US safely! So returns are only an option for items that don't meet the expectations of the advertisement, this guitar should arrive perfectly playable so that is why my policy is set this way. it is to discourage scams. Once, I had an individual \"return\" an item with fake parts replaced in it and the originals stolen. I hope you understand my apprehensions. I am reasonable.", "ItemID": "333003640367", "EndTime": "2019-01-15T15:14:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-08T15:14:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Telecaster-style-electric-guitar-Hand-carved-Body-Fender-U-S-Electronics-/333003640367", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Boonsboro, Maryland", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330036403678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/VrsAAOSwmE9cGQvu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/nb0AAOSwUm5cGQvW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/pksAAOSws~pcGQvk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/CfcAAOSwSudcGQvi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "21713", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jam5389", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 398, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "3***j", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 27}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Telecaster style electric guitar, Hand carved Body, Fender U.S. Electronics", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Rosewood stain"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Fresh new frets"]}]}, "HitCount": 280, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 255.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
