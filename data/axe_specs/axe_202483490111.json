Neck is straight and frets look new, Electronics work as they should,I didn't find any marks, bumps or nicks on the guitar yet it has been sitting around my house for years. I bought this guitar off e bay a few years ago I don't know what year it was made. Looks to me like the neck was painted but it was like that when I bought it. Also one volume knob is a little different looking than the others and there is a bit of rust on strap button screws and cover screws from sitting. This guitar has been strung and professionally set up on 10/23/18 so it is ready to play and It plays and sounds great. I don't have a case or gig bag but it will be packed very well.

I do not list guitars for the fun of it.I expect the winning bidder to pay.On Oct-29-18 at 19:41:20 PDT, seller added the following information: Bidders are asking me if this guitar had a neck repair. I don't know because I bought it just as it is. I never payed any attention to the neck other than the color was - is a bit off. I have now looked the neck over real good and there is no flaws or evidence of a repair. Maybe past owners just wanted a really smooth neck.", "ItemID": "202483490111", "EndTime": "2018-11-04T00:36:16.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-28T00:36:16.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-1960s-Tribute-Plus-Electric-guitar-/202483490111", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Carriere, Mississippi", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC", "Discover", "AmEx"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2024834901118080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/olIAAOSwLmBb1PCp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bZcAAOSw2-pb1PC6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2B8AAOSwy~Jb1PDJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FYoAAOSwGsJb1PDY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/o4MAAOSwVcZb1PDk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6BYAAOSwRrlb1PDy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VMAAAOSw831b1PEB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DIsAAOSwp7Rb1PEW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hnoAAOSw0Btb1PEx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mucAAOSwjrFb1PCN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5Z4AAOSwE9Bb1PFM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G1wAAOSwTJtb1PFY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "39426", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "xx55ppp0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 126, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.5}, "BidCount": 31, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 250.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1446}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul 1960's Tribute Plus Electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["1960 Tribute"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Brown"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 904, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 255.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": true, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
