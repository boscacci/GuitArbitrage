You are looking at a 2018 Jackson SL2Q HT Pro Series Soloist. High Performance AXE! Modern Metal Players Dream! From The Web: Unlock your full potential as a player with the innovative Jackson Pro Series Soloist SL2Q MAH, the final word in high-tech guitar design. A high-performance evolution of the electric guitar, this ergonomic instrument opens up new horizons of playability, resetting the bar of what\u2019s possible in guitar design. Premium features include a mahogany body with a quilt maple top and a one-piece through-body maple neck with scarf joint and graphite reinforcement rods to provide stiffness and high stability, guarding against temperature- and humidity-induced bending and warping. Its 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets is designed for highly technical light speed playing\u2014more curved by the nut for comfortable chording, it flattens out as you move up the neck (with hand-rubbed oil back finish) for increasingly fast playing speed and wide bends without fretting out. Chosen specifically for their complementary sound, a pair of modern Seymour Duncan Distortion humbucking pickups drives this guitar\u2019s voice, combining for highly balanced, flexible tone, with plenty of high output for pristine cleans and snarling distortion. Single volume and tone controls shape the pickups\u2019 output, which can be further refined with the three-way toggle switch for the precise voice required to bring your musical vision to life. Dive and soar expressively with the Floyd Rose FRT-O5000 double-locking tremolo bridge, recessed for pick hand comfort and providing laser-accurate intonation and ultra-stable tuning. All the famous Jackson appointments are offered with the SL2Q MAH \u2014black nickel hardware, piranha tooth inlays, Jackson-branded sealed die-cast tuning machines and traditional pointed 6-in-line matching headstocks Serial Number: ISJ1702195 Weight: 8.05 lbs. Nut Width: 1.68\" I am selling this as a used guitar because there is a Chip at the tip of the Headstock. (See pictures #9, #10). The Chip is in the wood only on the back side. This is a demo in our shop. It has never been sold before. Our luthier did a complete setup. Frets are in great shape. Neck is Straight. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Case Is NOT Included Cosmetics: Excellent Condition. Other than the aforementioned chip at the tip of the headstock, it is in Mint Condition. Dripping with \"Mojo\" It is used. Not perfect. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story. We are here to help!
