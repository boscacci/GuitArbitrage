{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a Kramer XL-III electric guitar. It is bone stock, no mods whatsoever. The serial number is XL3-02174. I believe these were one of the last Kramer guitars with the \u201cNeptune, NJ USA\u201d neckplates. The maple neck on this model is what the vintage Kramer\u2019s were about! Most of the XL models had Rosewood necks, so this is definitely a more desirable model. It is straight and buttery smooth, with very low action. The rest of the guitar is good in my opinion. There are a few dings and scratches here and there, just like you would expect from an older vintage guitar. The weight of the guitar is 7.6lbs. The finish is nice with REAL vintage aged white color. The white bodies with maple necks were one of the last XL-III guitars. For the average going price of these vintage Kramer XL guitars, comparable priced guitars would be like a new Fender Squier. But there is no way a Fender Squier or whatever can compete with this. The guitar plays great and all electronics work. Remember it is vintage late 80\u2019s/ early 90\u2019s guitar, not a brand new Squier or an Epiphone from a big retail store. So I am selling this guitar AS-IS, because I cannot give you some long warranty of a brand new guitar. I am a personal seller. It\u2019s worked great for 30 years, don\u2019t see a reason it would stop working now. This guitar was built in South Korea, NOT CHINA! A lot better craftsmanship in my opinion. Even though the neckplate says Neptune, NJ USA, it is NOT an American Kramer. I would say this would be considered like a Mexican Strat to an American Stratocaster. Hence, the price is not in thousands like an American Kramer!", "ItemID": "113581010567", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T06:01:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-20T23:29:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kramer-XL-3-Guitar-Last-Original-Kramer-s-/113581010567", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Owensville, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135810105678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTU2/z/ZaUAAOSwzgtcO7bS/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5ODY=/z/bbMAAOSwNJJcO7br/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H6QAAOSwlINcO7cx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OY4AAOSw~5dcO7dx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU1OFgxNjAw/z/ROoAAOSwxJ9cO7cN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XDwAAOSwt0dcO7dX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bBkAAOSwt0dcO8ZF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/fD8AAOSwl1RcO8e9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/J0gAAOSwvytcO8ac/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pxoAAOSwhYJcO8fq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XTkAAOSwukZcO8a6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZRcAAOSwJb5cO8e5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "47665", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "deri_hende", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 234, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 267.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 267.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Kramer XL 3 Guitar.
