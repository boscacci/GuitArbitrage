The guitar has been plugged into an amp using the cord that came with it and the playing sound is good through the speaker; both dials appear to function as expected. We do not have the experience or expertise to say fully what the playing quality of this instrument might have, therefore we are listing it as USED with LIMITED TESTING.Although this guitar was well liked by famous players, such as Jimmy Page, John Lennon, and the Rolling Stones throughout the 60's and 70's, many people did not believe the mel-o-bar to be anything special, and only until the mid-1980's did many find out about the unique qualities of this easy play stand up steel guitar, invented by Walt Smith. In the early 80's Walt's son, along with John Shelby, worked on the new versions on Walt's guitar, one being the wonderful guitar in this listing.Included with this package is the original hard case in good condition with keys, a nice strap with little wear, an amp cord, two fender picks, and a Speedbar metal finger slide. Also included is the original information sheet and the Melobar Guitar Course - Book One. Item #6115-9589 Please note: All items are sold \"as is\".
