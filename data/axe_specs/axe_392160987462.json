{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1971 Gibson SG Standard in a super rare NATURAL finish. Large Guard, Lyher tailpiece, 60's appointments. Has the original black pat sticker T Top pickups. Covers have never been removed. Sodder has never been tapped on the pots and wiring harness. Excellent condition with a little wear and a few player dents (see photos). The pots read 13770. Natural finish was ONLY issued in 1971. I checked all cavities and it is not a refin. I listed this once before and had a few emails that suggested that this is a refin or stripped. NO sign of any other color ever on this guitar and all cavities show that this has always been a natural finish. All wear signs show that this is he original finish. Total mojo, you can feel every note and vibration through the entire guitar when playing. Includes a hardshell case, it's a little ruff on one end but secure. This is a really cool guitar, fun to play, amazing tone. Listing as an auction with a low starting point. I would keep it but I am down sizing. I have way too many guitars.", "ItemID": "392160987462", "EndTime": "2018-11-05T02:56:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-29T02:56:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-SG-Standard-Rare-Natural-Finish-1971-1970-1969-/392160987462", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Gilbert, Arizona", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3921609874628080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6bEAAOSw21RbzRjS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TDEAAOSwme1bzRja/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/V-8AAOSwAjpbzRjh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTAwWDM3NQ==/z/SO4AAOSwHWtbzRjz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc1WDUwMA==/z/kWUAAOSwtLtbzRj2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc1WDUwMA==/z/ZMsAAOSwiuxbzRj3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc1WDUwMA==/z/uOoAAOSwv5xbzRj4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc1WDUwMA==/z/f-EAAOSwoM5bzRj5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q4UAAOSwtBZbzhmr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tAUAAOSwo7Zbzhm5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "85295", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tdsgman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1466, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 6, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***0", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 170}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson SG Standard Rare Natural Finish 1971 1970 1969", "HitCount": 356, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2610.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
