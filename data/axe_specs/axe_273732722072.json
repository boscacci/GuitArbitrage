{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Gibson es 335 vintage. This is a fantastic guitar. I have been the proud owner for 5 years and it has brought me great joy. This 335 came to me as just a husk, so there is no original hardware or pickups. It does have: -500k pots -Classic 57 in neck -Lindy Fralin pure PAF in bridge -StewMac repro trapeeze tail piece -original frets -grover tuning machines. -comes with Gator Hard Case. There was an attempt to thwart a neck reset when a previous owner attached a plate on the heal to the body (shown in pictures). It is holding without it, but probably will need a reset at some point. Frets are original and low, no neck break at all. Previous owner may have painted inside f holes as there are a few yellow spots, but not noticable and easily removable. Never been drilled for a hard tail, but two small holes makes me think a bigsby at one point. Excepting offers!! If you have any questions, please let me know.", "ItemID": "273732722072", "EndTime": "2019-02-27T00:47:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-27T00:06:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1971-Gibson-es-335TD-/273732722072", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2737327220728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/nQIAAOSw8VNcdcTg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/pMkAAOSwiuRcdcT2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/-cQAAOSwKxVcdcUU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/vC0AAOSwT9lcdcUq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "55434", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "floydfanatic75", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 103, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1750.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "x***x", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 457}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1971 Gibson es 335TD", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}]}, "HitCount": 31, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
