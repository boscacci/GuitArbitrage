{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2014 Gibson J-45 Custom Shop Standard VOS Red Spruce Ltd EdW/COA & Case. ITS VOS YOU WILL NOT FIND A VOS AT THIS PRICE EVER. Condition is Used. This is your chance to own a gibson custom shop at a reasonable price. Guitar has never had headstock break or anything. The only reason I'm selling this j-45 custom shop so cheap is because it has been heavily used as seen in photos. So expect little dings, scuffs, and scratches but nothing horrendes. All the electronics work pretty good. I'd say the action is on the higher side. It's got the regular acoustic hump on the fretboard that acoustic guitars get. Ifs got a little smell im not sure if its lemon oil or weed smell from previous owner. No fret buzz, sounds amazing, and it's reasonably priced. ITS VOS YOU WILL NOT FIND A VOS AT THIS PRICE EVER. All original parts and comes with the original case. Only problem with the case is one latch is a little lose. I will only accept returns if it does not come as described or was damaged during shipment. So ask as many questions as you like or ask for photos. ThanksOn Feb-13-19 at 20:46:29 PST, seller added the following information: after going through all the frets again with a harder pick there is a little buzz on the d string at fret 14 and 15 fret, every thing else has no buzz", "ItemID": "113639026901", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T00:12:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-14T00:12:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2014-Gibson-J-45-Custom-Shop-Standard-VOS-Red-Spruce-Ltd-Ed-W-COA-Case-/113639026901", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1136390269018080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mv4AAOSwJD1cZKaT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/N7gAAOSwf4BcZKbV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IqUAAOSwsrBcZKbY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tw8AAOSwA0JcZKbb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wVQAAOSwo~dcZKbg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5NYAAOSw379cZKbm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rpsAAOSwZFJcZKbt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rlgAAOSwMoZcZKb3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oW0AAOSwKxVcZKb~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ut4AAOSwFdFcZKcB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xXEAAOSwYNdcZKcE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OrEAAOSwRwxcZKcI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "89108", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "armandpico_2", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 8, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***7", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 587}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2014 Gibson J-45 Custom Shop Standard VOS Red Spruce Ltd Ed \u00a0W/COA & Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Spruce"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2014"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 368, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
