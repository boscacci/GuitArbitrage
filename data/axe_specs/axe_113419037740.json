The guitar is shiny and gorgeous, in excellent condition. Here is the description from Amazon: The Floyd Rose Special is the authentic version of a licensed Floyd Rose tremolo system. It maintains the features of an Original Floyd Rose, while utilizing zinc alloy saddles in place of steel and a zinc alloy sustain block in place of brass.EMG Active 81/85 PickupsThe Maple top transfers a bright tone to the body which complements the warm tones of a mahogany body. Maple has a uniform grain, it\u2019s strong and stable, and it has less reaction from environmental changes than other hardwoods.The Rosewood fretboard is naturally oily, and works well for any surface that sees frequent human contact. The sound is richer in fundamental than Maple because the stray overtones are absorbed into the oily pores.Grover tuners 2) Schecter Guitar Research Diamond Series Molded Guitar Case - see Amazon product number B001U5NYD4 for details, this item alone sells for $150 on Amazon.

Also, the keys for the guitar case. Notes on condition: the guitar was played very little, estimating a total of 4 to 5 hours playing time. My cousin claimed the 6th string (thinnest string) was out of tune and attempted to tune the string like a traditional guitar, by cranking the tuning knob at the top of the guitar without loosing the top bracket with the provided wrench. He never seen a Floyd Rose guitar before. So, the thin 6th string broke between the tuning knob and the top bracket, so the 6th string will need to eventually be replaced (interestingly, the 6th string is actually still playable and may still be in tune due to the Floyd Rose feature).
