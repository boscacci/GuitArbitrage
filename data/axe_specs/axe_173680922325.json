{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I got this with only the body/neck and pickups. Serial number 86756. I would assume this is a late 60's. All other parts are non original. That would be tone/ volume pots, knobs, tuners, pickgaurd, bridge and tailpeice, strap buttons.The 1/4\" input jack was intact with the body. The route for the Burns vibrato is covered by the tailpiece. Trussrod functions properly and it plays nicely up and down the neck. It sounds like a Gretcsh. I know because I have owned a few and the Hilo Tron pickups sound as they should and wired to original Corvette schematic. No neck repairs but it does have cracks in the finish and chips. Neck joint is solid. Please view photos carefully.All work was done by a professional lutherer not a do it yourself job. Not a collector's item but a nice player. Buyer pays $25.00 shipping to lower 48 states only and I will cover the rest. Free local pickup in the Williamette Valley Oregon area could be arranged. The headstock appears to have been painted over as evidenced by the Gretsch decal area. After close examination by myself and a local repair shop there is no apparent headstock repair. I can send detailed photos upon request.", "ItemID": "173680922325", "EndTime": "2018-12-11T15:00:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T23:55:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Gretsch-6135-Corvette-/173680922325", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Gates, Oregon", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736809223258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/oGcAAOSw-HRcCq9T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/ntMAAOSwVEFcCq~U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/nPsAAOSwNYtcCrBe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/GSwAAOSwZupcCrCC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/pLYAAOSwsDZcCrDC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/vsAAAOSwC9hcCrDp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/vmsAAOSwrZBcCrEP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/TVoAAOSw8MxcCrE9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/1UUAAOSwq6VcCrGK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NVgxNjAw/z/CMoAAOSwkelcCrGk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/6RgAAOSwFURcCrH0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk1/z/6YkAAOSwFURcCrIf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "97346", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "clazarus", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1202, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 375.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 208}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage Gretsch 6135 Corvette", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch"]}]}, "HitCount": 210, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 380.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
