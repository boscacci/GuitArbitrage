{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "DESCRIPTION This is a Fender Stratocaster left handed electric guitar. The serial number is N-979250 on the FRONT of the head stock. From a serial number look up, that indicates it is 1990. (The 1999 model had the serial numbers on the back.) The body finish looks to be in good shape, with only a few signs of use. The chrome pieces have some minor pitting. I can see some plastic covering sticking out around the knobs, so it appears that was peeled off. I got this from an estate along with two amps. I plugged the guitar into the amp and it played. It has not been used for years. I'm not a guitarist, so am unable to assess the playing quality. It comes with the Fender hard case pictured.
