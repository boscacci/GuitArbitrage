{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this Epiphone Casino hollow body electric guitar in a rare and beautiful turquoise finish. The guitar was made in 2000 at the very reputable Peerless factory in Korea. Overall, the guitar is in very good condition, but it does show some signs of use. The guitar looks, plays, and sounds great! The frets are in good condition and were recently polished. The action is setup low and it is a real pleasure to play. The original Epiphone P-90 pickups have a nice bite to them and can really roar with a little overdrive. There are some small scratches and dings here and there, but nothing that affects the performance of the instrument. These turquoise Casino guitars were only made for a few years and have been discontinued. They are becoming hard to find, especially in this good of condition. The guitar comes comes with a nice fitted SKB hardshell case.Feel free to ask any questions or make an offer!", "ItemID": "264056676691", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T20:57:22.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-23T21:47:26.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2000-Epiphone-Casino-Turquoise-TQ-MIK-Peerless-Korea-Hollow-Body-Electric-Guitar-/264056676691", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cathedral City, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640566766918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pz4AAOSw1T1b-HUc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EXQAAOSwMPpb-HUa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kBIAAOSwXHxb-HUy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0U8AAOSwBfhb-HUQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wCEAAOSwfhlb-HUo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Yj8AAOSwEppb-HUj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iCIAAOSwzqtb-HU1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/du0AAOSwCVtb-HU3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/o5cAAOSwuMRb-HUv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zVwAAOSwSn1b-HUg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2IsAAOSwHrlb-HUv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YmEAAOSwxJ9b-HUg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mydeadblues", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 888.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 888.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "p***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1446}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2000 Epiphone Casino Turquoise TQ MIK Peerless Korea Hollow Body Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}]}, "HitCount": 415, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
