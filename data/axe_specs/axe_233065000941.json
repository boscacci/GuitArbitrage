{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for your consideration is this beautiful 1978 Gibson Les Paul Custom. This road warrior is fully stock with no customizations. There was a flaw in the paint (according to the interwebs) during production which is likely the reason for the SECOND stamp on the back of the headstock. I can attest to the fact that the SECOND stamp has no impact on the fantastic, low, action and near endless sustain. This guitar comes from a non-smoking, no pets, home.The Custom model went through several major changes through the years. This version has 2 humbuckers, ebony fretboard with block inlays, and a maple-capped solid-mahogany body in the traditional Les Paul Custom black with gold hardware. It comes with the original deluxe Gibson hardshell case.Shipping, with full insurance, is free in the continental US. The guitar is fully functional and clean with no mechanical issues. Looks, sounds, and plays great. With that being said, the guitar is sold as-is due to its age.This guitar could be the first step towards your signature sound. Don't miss out on this piece of rock and roll history! PS - Why am I selling this sweet sweet axe? The main reason is that I'm older now and I'm no longer playing regularly. Also, I believe this guitar is sad because it's not being played as often as it needs. Sometimes I hear soft weeping coming from the case. Please rescue it from its sadness.....Points of note:- The guitar has never been damaged or repaired- The fret wear is average and there are no dead or flat spots as far as I can tell- The SECOND stamp indicates that there was a flaw in the paint during production but was resolved by repainting the guitar- The guitar consistently receives praise on both appearance and sound- This is an authentic Gibson guitar - NOT a cheap imitation or knock-off- Made in the USA", "ItemID": "233065000941", "EndTime": "2018-12-25T00:22:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-23T23:27:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1978-Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom-Electric-Guitar-Black-Beauty-Used-but-not-abused-/233065000941", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330650009418080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/smcAAOSw8iZb-yVe/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/-yQAAOSw2~Nb-yVd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/SFcAAOSwoVZb-yVk/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/F9oAAOSwUfVb-yVU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/S5IAAOSwteFb-yVi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/mH8AAOSwHjtb-yVg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/IWgAAOSwtYZb-yVh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/VNYAAOSw0xtb-yVi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/AJ4AAOSwTEZb-yVg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "55449", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "teamsourbelly", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 86, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 475}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1978 Gibson Les Paul Custom Electric Guitar - Black Beauty - Used but not abused", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1978"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Custom"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple", "Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 56, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 3250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78656430", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
