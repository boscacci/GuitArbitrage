Let this guitar inspire you. Case sold separately. Railhammer Billy Corgan signature pickups Part of Railhammer\u2019s new Humcutter Series, these pickups were developed with Billy to capture the clarity and dynamics of a P90, but with the thick tone and low noise of a humbucker. Chambered korina body Korina (aka White Limba) is a medium lightweight wood, highly prized for consistency and tonal qualities. \u00a0It is a key factor to producing our lively, responsive instruments that are rich in harmonics. \u00a0On the BC-1 there are strategic chambers under the pickguard to add even more resonance and reduce weight. Pin-lock tuners A thumbwheel under the tuner pushes a steel pin up through the post, locking the string in place for exceptional tuning stability and super-fast string changes. Also, the posts are custom height, eliminating the need for a second string tree. String-thru body bridge String-thru body design and stainless steel saddles for a percussive attack that provides maximum sustain and a ringing, solid tone. Low profile knobs / bass contour All the controls feature the classic low profile knob shape, rendered in a chrome finish. The passive Bass Contour is great for tightening up the low end, or re-voicing the pickups. Variable pickup voicing at your fingertips! Graphite nut Reverend use a graphite impregnated nut on all their instruments. Graphite reduces friction, allowing the strings to easily slide through the nut slots, improving tuning stability.", "ItemID": "123497228032", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T01:47:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-18T01:55:44.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Reverend-BC-1-Billy-Corgan-Signature-Electric-Guitar-Satin-Pearl-White-/123497228032", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Springfield, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234972280328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SYEAAOSwnWpb8MXz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0RsAAOSwESRb8MX0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/P04AAOSws0pb8MXw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AO8AAOSwyUFb8MXx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/apoAAOSwNUlb8MXu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "65804", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "feelingsupersonic417", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 160, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 950.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 83}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Reverend BC-1 Billy Corgan Signature Electric Guitar Satin Pearl White", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Korina"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Reverend"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["BC-1"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Satin Pearl White"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 259, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
