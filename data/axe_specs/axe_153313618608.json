{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a used 2005 Squier by Fender M-80 Special electric guitar in very good condition. The guitar is in 8.5/10 condition with only some finish wear on a couple of spots of the satin finish, the switch tip is missing (switch not broken) and a circular mark in the neck by the back of the low E tuner. The guitar has 90-95% of its fret life left, and the neck is in beautiful shape. Untouched electronics that function as they should. The Guitar has had a full setup including action height, neck relief, Strobe set intonation, and fret polish and fret board clean and conditioning. These were great little guitars, much like an SG with a thicker body at approximately 7Lbs. There is no case or bag for this one but will be packed accordingly.
