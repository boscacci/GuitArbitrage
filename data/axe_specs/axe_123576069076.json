{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Jim Root Signature Telecaster - This is the White with black hardware model. Two active EMG pickups accompany the guitar, one 83 and one 80. The guitar is mahogany with a mahogany fretboard. Single volume pot. Fender locking tuners, of which the low E-String tuner fell apart. Replaced with a Ratio #6 locking tuner. Everything works as it should, it has just been played a lot and has some dings and scrapes and I have included photos of the noteworthy scrapes. The case exterior has been chewed up in travel but the inside is nice. All case candy that came with the guitar is bagged and in the case. Please ask all questions before bidding as I do not accept returns. I have been transparent about the issues with the guitar and if you have any questions ask before bidding. If you bid and win I am assuming you are satisfied with the guitar and my description, because you will not be returning it. I am charging a flat 50.00 for UPS ground anywhere in the continental USA and I have the original Fender box to ship it in. Good luck and thank you for looking!", "ItemID": "123576069076", "EndTime": "2019-01-09T22:01:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-02T22:01:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Jim-Root-Telecaster-Used-Nice-Condition-/123576069076", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Birmingham, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235760690768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/F0IAAOSwC~9cLS4K/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ZewAAOSwip5cLS4t/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/GDcAAOSw4zdcLS5F/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/nLYAAOSwtYZcLS0N/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/4J4AAOSwo1lcLS0W/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Du0AAOSwhY9cLS5h/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BdMAAOSwj91cLS5w/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/WM8AAOSwJ3RcLS58/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/lf0AAOSwAmJcLS6Q/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/lXAAAOSw~odcLS68/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4FkAAOSwVN1cLS7P/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/UXoAAOSw5EpcLS7g/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "35210", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "odonpa1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 100, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 35, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 480.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 480.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 13}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Jim Root Telecaster - Used Nice Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Jim Root Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["EMG 80 Pickup", "EMG 83 Pickup", "Single Cut", "Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Signature Line"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}]}, "HitCount": 592, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 485.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Used, the original Fender locking low E-string tuning peg malfunctioned, so I replaced it with a Ratio Locking tuner.
