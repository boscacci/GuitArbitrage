{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction, Kramer\u2019s most sought after late 70\u2019s Vintage Kramer 650G Artist Aluminum Neck Guitar. The 650G Artist was Kramer\u2019s flagship guitar (the top of their line up) in 1978 with only 400 ever produced. Now spanning 40 years the 650G Artist is becoming extremely rare and iconic. The beautiful 7 layered laminations of Walnut and Birdseye Maple display the finest craftsmanship of the Kramer USA era. These necks were designed for ultimate sustain utilizing solid aluminum with walnut inlays for smooth hand play, Ebonol fret board accented with mother of pearl Crown inlays (650G exclusive), 25\u201d scale length with Schaller tuners. *100% original \"Kramer Logo\" pickups and electronics in working condition. *The previous owner has replaced the original walnut pick up rings with homemade rings (this is common as the original rings were very fragile). To my knowledge everything else is factory original. *2 volume controls, 2 tone control knobs w/ 3-way selector switch. *Very good condition for it's age, with a few nicks/dings mainly in the clear coat and not through to the wood. There are some clear coat scratches around the top pick up area made by the previous owners walnut ring replacement. See photo enlargement. *Amazing sustain, much like a Travis Bean. *The tone goes from warm bell to jangly treble to thick, heavy rock and roll and so much fun to play. *Excellent on its own or with a full blown effects board\u2026 Delays, chorus and distortions love this guitar. Sold as is. No Returns. Ships to USA only. Alaska and Hawaii must pay actual shipping costs.
