{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Kramer Baretta in great condition. This sale is for the guitar only there is no case. Neck thru body with reverse headstock, Nuclear Yellow color, 2 quad rail humbuckers, 1 tone, 1 volume, 3 position sector swtch, coil tap, Floyd Rose licenced locking tremalo and nut, Gotoh tuners. This guitar was made in Korea. The Kramer name was bought by Gibson and these guitars were sold exclusively through Music Yo I bought the guitar new and played it a little but the fretboard has to flat a radius and is a bit to wide for me. The guitar is in very nice condition. There are a few light scratches from being played and handled over the years (to light to show up in pictures). Under a bright light at the right angle you can see them. The black face of the headstock has some light swirling (or towel marks) that sort of show up in the pictures. The fret board has a small knot hole that the factory did not get filled completely leaving a pinhole.These guitars were built pretty well but the final finish was never perfect, you can see where the body sections were glued to the neck blank under bright light at the right angle. Either the filler has shrank or it was never sanded 100% flat in the first place. All that being said you will be hard pressed to ever find a Music Yo.com Baretta in as good of condition as this one. The guitar is set up to use Martin Darco D9600 Nickel Light/Heavy 10's (10-13-17-30-42-52).I will include a set of strings. If you decide to change the string gauge or type expect to do quite a bit of work to get the floating tremolo setup correctly. The guitar is in original condition except for 2 things, the strap buttons were replaced with strap locks and the d-tuna that came with the guitar is missing. The floating tremolo system will have to be re-installed and the guitar restrung after you receive the guitar. The floating tremolo will be removed from the guitar and packed so it does not get damaged or cause damage during shipping. If you do not feel comfortable reinstalling it, please do not bid. I wont be held responsible for any damage done when reinstalling the tremolo or restringing the guitar.The reason for doing this is you don't want to ship a guitar with it strung under full sting tension. If you loosen the strings on a floating tremolo it can come loose and/or the back of the tremolo will tip and damage the cavity it sits in. I want you to be 100% satisfied so ask any questions you need to. The guitar will be shipped and insured for the final sale price and will require an adult signature for delivery. Will sell only in USA (Lower 48) Unless special arrangements made before sale. Shipping outside North America is not available.", "ItemID": "303041475815", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T10:07:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T10:07:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kramer-Baretta-reverse-headstock-neck-thru-body-Nuclear-Yellow-not-played-much-/303041475815", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Billings, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3030414758158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rnQAAOSw90NcTC3m/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yCIAAOSwyn1cTC9p/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RgQAAOSwXyBcTC33/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/j0cAAOSwhYJcTC~H/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/Ij0AAOSw60NcTC-Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/zMEAAOSwfTlcTC-n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/UfEAAOSwqLRcTC-v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/Z7YAAOSw5EpcTC-8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/08sAAOSwDEBcTC3v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "65610", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wlshephard", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 43, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 908}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Kramer Baretta reverse headstock neck thru body Nuclear Yellow not played much", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Kramer"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Superstrat"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Baretta"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Nuclear Yellow"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 372, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Charity": {"CharityID": "36973", "CharityName": "Shriners Hospitals for Children", "CharityNumber": 31782, "DonationPercent": 10.0, "Mission": "Shriners Hospitals for Children is a one-of-a-kind international health care system dedicated to improving the lives of children by providing specialty pediatric care, innovative research and outstanding teaching programs.
