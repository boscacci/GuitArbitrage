{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction today is a 1989 Gibson Les Paul Special. After the poor quality guitars of the Norlin era, Gibson was purchased by Henry Juszkiewicz and company in 1986. And they promptly elevated the build quality of all Gibson guitars. This guitar is one such example of the early days of the new Gibson quality (let\u2019s not even bring up what goes on currently under Henry\u2019s reign... OK, maybe I will a little). All the hardware on this guitar is top notch. Beefy all steel original Grover machine heads, cold rolled steel Tune-o-matic bridge, not the current zinc/pot metal bridge you get unless you buy a custom shop Les Paul and then you get the cold rolled steel Tune-o-matic that came standard with this Gibson and all the Gibsons of this era. You see where I\u2019m going with this. The body is one piece slab mahogany. Yes, one piece. Check the pictures. I can\u2019t find any sort of seam which would indicate two pieces. I\u2019ve been looking for years. The neck feels a bit like a 60s slim taper but not as slim to me. I like it. The pickups in this guitar are NOT P90s. They are P100s. They are a humbucking version of a P90 configuration. And they do NOT sound like P90s. Some people love these pickups, some people hate these pickups. I\u2019m in the love category. They are two P90 type coils stacked on one another to cancel the hum. They sound smooth and sweet and deep. But they can growl and rock. They sound pretty damn good through my OCD overdrive and my Rat pedal. These are also the original configuration of the P100 which is far superior to what Gibson started shoving in the LP Special in the mid 90s. You can tell because they have acrylic bobbins and have a fatter wind in the coil. Included in the photos is an example of the pickups that are in this guitar but not from this guitar. And if you really wanted you could stick two P90s in here, easy peezy. This is a true player\u2019s guitar. Well used but still in great condition. Dings and nicks abound on the finish, but that goes with the territory on a near 30-year-old, well played guitar. You could say it\u2019s organically reliced. You\u2019ll notice the pick up covers are a bit scratched, actually I would say there are deep grooves on certain areas of the cover, pick gouges. Like I said, this is a players guitar. I bought it from the original owner who gigged with it a lot. Original Gibson coffin case included. ______________ Specifications BODY:Single piece mahogany slab NECK:Mahogany FINGERBOARD:Rosewood, 22frets w/ Ivory Binding NECK PROFILE:60s-ish SCALE:24.75\u201d NUT: Hard Plastic (1 11/16\u201d) INLAY:Mother of pearl dot JOINT:Set-neck TUNERS:Grover BRIDGE:Gibson Tune-o-matic (original cold rolled steel) PICKUPS:P100s Neck and Bridge (original models with the acrylic bobbins) PARTS:CTS control pots, switch craft output jack CONTROLS:Neck Volume&Tone, Bridge Volume&Tone, Toggle PU Selector WEIGHT:8 lbs 14.6 oz ________ Good luck.", "ItemID": "192751242060", "EndTime": "2018-12-14T22:15:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-07T22:15:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1989-Gibson-Les-Paul-Special-Guitar-/192751242060", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927512420608080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WbYAAOSwvupbyHuY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/n~AAAOSwHgRbyHvU/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ylMAAOSwgA1byHvS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rBIAAOSwWhVbyHvX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/qAQAAOSww6ZbyHz0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L7kAAOSwI~VbyH0d/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7IMAAOSwd2ZbyH0g/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/0FIAAOSwyEdbyH1K/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/H9kAAOSwQ-1byH2E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/wVYAAOSw~QhbyOWJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mjk0WDcxNg==/z/-0IAAOSwQIFbyOWZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNjAw/z/ck8AAOSwCtNbyOWm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60625", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gn2595", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 341, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 12, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 651.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 651.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2862}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1989 Gibson Les Paul Special Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1989"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Special"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["none"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 513, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 661.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
