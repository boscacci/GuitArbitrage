I am a professional musician and as you can see from the photos, I'm running out of space. I'm happy to entertain any \"reasonable offers\". It's in excellent shape although you'd probably want to have a set up done so that it is to your particular liking. I've owned it since 2013 I believe, and it's only been used in studio sessions and rehearsals until now and always well cared for. We're getting ready for a cross country move in January and we need to make some room. Make me an Offer I can't refuse and you could be \"Chuckies\" next new Owner. It's a wonderful guitar. In superb shape with Coil Taps and 5 way switching. A Really Ballsy Strat. It Plays Great and Sounds even Better. I've always put it through a Black Face Twin strung 9's - 42's. Sometimes a little heavier on the Bass end. Depending on the project. ~ Thanks for writing SFA, and IF you like the Guitar.... Do Make mean OFFER ~ ALL \"Reasonable\" Offers Fully and Fairly Considered. I need the space.
