{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello. This is a 1984 Fender Stratocaster E code guitar made in Japan. In is in near mint condition. The frets are big and perfect. Rosewood fretboard on maple. No wear in any part of the neck. Keep in mind when you find an older guitar the frets are usually worn. The seller will always write in his ad that \"Theres plenty of life left in the frets\". Run from that listing. They are lying to you. I know this from buying over one hundred fifty guitars from Ebay. Sellers usually lie in these cases. Fret jobs are two hundred dollars. It is a very comfortable neck and is easy to play. It sounds like a strat whether plugged in or not. The neck is a twelve radius and has 22 frets. It is known as the contemporary 84-87 Stratocaster. Vintage bridge, big block tremolo. Fender sealed tuners with micro tilt neck adjustment. The truss rod adjustment is on the headstock and works as it should. The pickups have Alnico magnets and the OHM rating is: Neck, 8.50 ohms, middle, 9.00 ohms, and the bridge is 8.75 ohms.There is a super tiny chip in the paint on the bottom of the guitar (see picture). You really have to look for it. This is a beautiful guitar, and I'm not sure if there is one cleaner out there. My camera did not show the true color. It is really a pastel yellow color at this point. I have a tremolo arm for it. If you have any questions, Message me.
