{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this fantastic Feiten Tobacco Supernova Future Vintage Electric Guitar This guitar is in great condition, there are minimal signs of wear such as some hairline scratches on the body and some faint scuff marks. None of this affects the functionality of the guitar or even really distracts from how nice looking this Feiten Tobacco Supernova Future Vintage Electric Guitar looks. This is an authentic Feiten Supernova guitar guaranteed or your money back. The Classic is designed for players who love the Les Paul. It features a revolutionary \"rear loaded\" pickup design that vastly improves sustain and sounds tighter and punchier than the standard front loaded system. The 1/2\" pickup mounting plate attached to the back of the guitar increases sustain and sound transfer to the body by maximizing the vibration from the pickups. The plate with the pickups attached acts as a \u201cresonator\u201d, and the increase in sustain is amazing. The Classic also features a new \"wraparound\" style bridge with the Buzz Feiten Tuning System built in, a 24 3/4\" scale, tuning key extensions with a \"pyramid\" style tuning machine layout that provides straight string pull for all 6 strings, and my version of the classic PAF pickup design. Everyone who's played the Classic has raved about the Vintage tone and feel of the instrument. The Classic's Alnico5 magnets, 10+k output and BF design frequency response give the pickups a rare combination of warmth, punch, and sweet transparent highs. Clients include Jorge Santana, Vince Gill, Dean Parks, Paul Barrere (Little Feat), Chris Rodriguez (Kelly Clarkson/Rascal Flatts), Dave Howard/ Professor at Berkeley College of Music, Paul Brown, and many other great players. I'm grateful for my clients who have shown such incredible support and enthusiasm for this revolutionary approach.
