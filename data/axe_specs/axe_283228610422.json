{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1988 Gibson ES-335 Showcase Edition. Part of a limited edition with original EMG pickups. Original white finish with black hardware looks amazing and gives this one a super classy \"reverse tuxedo\" look. Has a fat, chunky neck that feels great in your palm and plays great all the way up and down with a low, quick action. Original EMG pickups are hot and thick with a clear, crisp tone. Very well balanced and defined, this one sounds amazing in any situation, offering up fantastic clean tones and holding up under any amount of gain. Excellent condition with some signs of light cosmetic wear. You can tell it's been played a little bit but only when you look closely. For a 30 year old guitar it has aged quite nicely and is verall a very clean example. Comes with the original hard shell case. Guitar is exactly as pictured.
