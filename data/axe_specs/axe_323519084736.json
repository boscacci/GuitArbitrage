{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Where do I start with this one? I will start with the body. This is 150 year old barn wood according to the ebay seller I bough it from. The ebay seller had several of these bodies offered on ebay years ago. This is the best body in the lot that he was selling. Best because it had the least amount of imperfections. When the dust settled on intense bidding ,at least 20 bidders, I was top bidder at 152.00. then there was the shipping added. The wood in this body is as beautiful as you will find anywhere in the world. It was made with strips of wood glued together from the heart section to the outer section of the 150 year old wood. The wood is a dense Yellow pine that grows in the Eastern part of USA. The body was clear coated with a satin finish from the seller when I bought it. Upon assembly there was a problem getting a neck to fit the neck pocket correctly. Pocket was only 5/8'' deep requiring me to deepen the pocket to \u00be''. No new neck I had would fit the pocket correctly which required me to remove a neck from one of my assembled guitars. I then had to reshape the headstock to Tele style. All the work paid off to make this into a beautiful package that you see here. The pickups are Fender USA models. The action is super low and plays quite well. Will ship in a nice gig bag. Shipping will be 30.00 to lower 48", "ItemID": "323519084736", "EndTime": "2018-11-02T14:00:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-26T14:00:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Homemade-T-Style-Partscaster-Guitar-Take-Look-/323519084736", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Mount Airy, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235190847368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/OMcAAOSwax5YvWHU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/Sa0AAOSwTuJYvWHG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/TgIAAOSw4CFYvWHc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/MbsAAOSwfVpYvWHo/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/LkYAAOSwWxNYvWHw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/LDIAAOSwdGFYvWH2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2M1gxNjAw/z/L1wAAOSwSlBYvWH7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/6vYAAOSw~AVYvWID/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/hH4AAOSwTM5YvWIM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/Vd0AAOSw4CFYvWIV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYz/z/L2MAAOSwdGFYvWId/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "27030", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "goodstuffonly*123", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3086, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 298.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 298.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 36}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": " Homemade T Style Partscaster Guitar -Take a Look!
