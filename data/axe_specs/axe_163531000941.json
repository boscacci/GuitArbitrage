{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is a USED Gibson ES-150DC Electric Guitar, Hollowbody, Double-Cutaway, Tobacco Sunburst.. ca 1973. Condition is Used. Included is a used non-original, molded hard case.A six-digit SN on the headstock places this ES-150DC in the 1970s, apparently 1973. Maybe you've read that some guitar players really love this model. It's only another electric, hollow-body arch top guitar, but the deep body and lack of an interior chunky wood block are characteristics that make it different from other electrics. When I bought this guitar, the owner did not mention a crack... Please look at the photos. Used condition is evident in photos. Outline of a \"spline finger\" in the back of neck under the headstock indicates repair, IMO.To my eye this has had a neck repair, which did not trouble me in the years I've owned this guitar. -- My favorite Gibson acoustic was broken before my eyes, out of my reach; then it was repaired; and it still is my favorite acoustic guitar. NO SALES OUTSIDE OF CONTINENTAL U.S.A. NO FOREIGN SALES.NO RETURNS. The internet has a fair amount of information about Gibson's ES-150D.
