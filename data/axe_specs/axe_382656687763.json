{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For your consideration is a great playing Gibson SG Special LTD in Blue Mist Mahogany Body./ Mahogany Neck . Guitar is light and well balanced (especially for a Gibson) and weighs in at 6lbs 13oz. This is an awesome sounding and playing guitar that would be a great addition to the arsenal of a player who doesn't mind some finish imperfections. - Guitar was outfitted with push/pull coil taps for both the neck and bridge pickups which sound amazing and open up a whole new world of tones for the 490R/490T pickups. Neck is straight as an arrow and the action is great - plays as a Gibson should - In terms of playability; I do recommend new strings and a setup as they strings were not installed very well. - There are a couple chips in the finish and some scratches from a pick evident on the body, I highlighted these in the photos. - Paint is chipping away where the fret board meets the neck on a couple spots on the bass side of the neck and more prevalent on the treble side. See photos. This is typical of Gibson paint job of this era. (see the last two pictures). - Some of the side dot inlays have some plastic remaining on them Includes Gibson USA Gigbag which is nicely lined! Buy it now for Free SHIPPING!
