{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "A 1951 Epiphone Broadway Regent in natural blonde finish with the dogwood headstock. This is a rare guitar and has playwear. At one time the , the tuners were changed but 5 of the originals were returned and a close period correct D tuner was added, the holes were filled by luthier Bill Giebtz who works out of Austin and Soccoro NM, he also crowned the frets which are original. The neck and body are in excellent and could serve as a template for archtop design. There is plenty of fret life left and the finish on the neck is not worn with only one ding that does not affect playablity. The finish is original with a one inch touch of overspray where a de armond pickup once lay. There is a serface or finish crack I\u2019m not sure which ( see photos), it has never moved or changed in the 6 years I\u2019ve owned the guitar.The guitar is loud and well balanced with a nice punch as you would expect and fun to play, chords have the distinct Epiphone sound. I use a set of 12\u2019s with a 13 changed out for the 12 or High E and it\u2019s great. There are five holes on the top which have been filled as has a strap button on the heel snd 2 holes on the side of the neck where the pick up was installed, ( see photos)the tailpiece has be resoldiered before I owned it an ok job could be sanded for better looks but is fine. The case is for an 18 inch Emperor although the wearmarks suggest this guitar has been in it along time. Although it is in players condition it is also colletable and a joy to play, a heartbreaker to loose. I have removed some photos and added closeups of the holes filled and the label to answer questions.On Nov-09-18 at 13:40:06 PST, seller added the following information: Correction: I have owned the guitar 2 years, not 6.
