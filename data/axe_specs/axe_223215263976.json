{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Original Owner With Original Case And Owners Manuel. *I believe most of the description to be correct. If it is not, the original owners manual comes with. The Ovation Country Artist is one of the more unique Ovation models. Basically a nylon string guitar for steel string finger pickers. It has a traditional flat classical fingerboard, but the nut width is a slim 1-7/8 inch compared to the typical 2 inch width of a classical. The neck joins the body at the 14th fret, same as Ovation steel sting guitars. As part of the Artist series, this guitar features the slightly shallower Artist depth bowl. The tuners are chrome plated Schaller Classicals. This guitar has kept a great bridge, neck and nut, and sings beautiful. It has a few blemishes as it is was made in 1979. The tone nob seems to be a bit tempermental, sometimes it functions properly but I would think it\u2019s an easy fix. Like many acoustic guitars of this vintage it has surface cracks but they do not interfere with sound or play-ability. Features: - Spruce top - Slot-head design with laminated 5-piece mahogany/maple neck. - Ovation active electronics with single volume knob control and tone control - Rosewood bridge - 20 fret ebony fingerboard with side markers - Vintage Ovation case included Glen Campbell played the closest version to this 429-1624-4 Catalog # 1124-4, the 429-1627-4 Catalog # 1127-4. I believe this to be the left-handed version of Glen\u2019s famous guitar. Please double check as I have. Cat Stevens and Al DiMeola also played this model or one similar.
