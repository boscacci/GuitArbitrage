{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "EDWARDS by ESP Item Description EDWARDS boasts outstanding cost performance as a direct ESP brand, Les Paul standard model with impressive flamboyant flame top, Although it is a lacquer taste series probably from the feeling of gloss of paint, I think that it is not a model which is applicable in the net etc and it is a limited model outside the catalog. \u3010SPEC\u3011 Body : Unknown Neck : Unknown Fingerboard : Unknown Pickups : HH Weight : kg Color : Sunburst Serial Number : Condition: Used Neck is nearly straight, there are plenty of frets and there is no particular problem in electrical systems. (For pots, garbage etc. may occur during storage due to consumables.) Although a state feeling of some use such as a minor bruise accompanying secular passing and use can be seen, It is a place such as a player's condition, not a thing which is special feeling, such as a big dent. All Electronics/Hardware function as they should. There is a few cosmetic damages like scratches, marks/dents and rusts on the metal parts. Please understand that this is a secondhand item.
