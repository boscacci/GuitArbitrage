{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Duesenberg Starplayer TV Blue Sparkle W/OHSC & Case Candy, Free Shirt Med (Never worn and brand new), Near Mint Excellent Condition. Shipped with USPS Parcel Select Ground. Hello there!! Thank you for checking out this guitar. I\u2019ve sadly decided to sell this beauty. Against my will actually, gotta pay off some bills so gotta downsize my guitar collection. I\u2019ve hard a hard time playing this guitar because I couldn\u2019t get over how beautiful it is. It\u2019s like a piece of art rather then a guitar. Kind of the \u201cnew guitar syndrome\u201d I\u2019ve only ever used this guitar at home or in studio to keep this guitar pristine. This guitar sounds incredible!! Probably the best playing guitar I\u2019ve ever owned. But I do not play it enough to keep it. It is setup with brand new Elixir Nanoweb 10\u2019s with low action. Comes with all case candy and a free medium Duesenberg shirt I got from them. I bought this straight from Germany and paid for customs. I didn\u2019t want to buy this guitar from a third party like guitar center or whatever and have everyone\u2019s filthy paws on it. So this is actually sent from the factory. *If you have never owned a Duesenberg guitar, just a note that the tremolo bars stay on inside the case. That\u2019s how it is and how they designed it. Weird I know, but the guitar amazingly stays in tune! Please only bid if you are willing to buy. And because of the price tag on this guitar, experienced buyers only! No bids from 0% or negative feedback ebayers! Please feel to ask me any questions. Duesenberg Starplayer TV - Blue Sparkle with Case It\u2019s not for nothing that the Starplayer TV is Duesenberg\u2019s bestselling guitar. Its punchiness, open sound and robustness, the always in-tune Deluxe Tremola and perfect playability make the Starplayer a very versatile instrument. In addition, the Starplayer\u2019s arched top and back bestows the guitar with a very stylish look. Even being such a versatile instrument, it always retains its discreet character and enriches every type or style of music with its distinct Duesenberg sound. This is proven by the many guitarists that come from all corners of the musical spectrum who chose this model. By now, The Domino P-90 neck pickup and the Grand Vintage Humbucker bridge pickup, an open and transparent sounding PAF-Type, have given the Starplayer TV its classic sound. Even the most exalted guitar-wishes can be fulfilled by our Special-Models. Let it be Skai leather covering, piezo bridge, aluminum Stop-Tailpieces, mother-of-pearl guitar top, Gold-Top or Sparkle finish or even equipping the guitar with Little-Toaster-Pickups \u2013 there\u2019s a Starplayer TV guitar for everyone. And lastly, lefties are not left out: There are even two Lefthand-models in our catalog!
