{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ernie Ball Music Man Axis Super Sport. The body is, I think, flame maple in tobacco sunburst, and the neck is birdseye maple with their super smooth matte finish for faster playing. I believe the pickups are the MM90 P90 pickups. I'll post the date of manufacture and confirm/change/add additional details if I can get them from EB. The guitar is in barely-played condition - I see one pin head-size flaw (I think it's a bubble, not a chip) on the face of the body (third to last pic, in an inch or so from the edge banding... Pretty tough to see),a similar sized flaw on the back by the battery door, and also a small shallow maybe 1/8\" x 3/16\" chip in the clear coat on the bottom edge of the back of the body (also pictured.. 4th-to-last pic). I don't see any other flaws in the finish, and headstock, tuners, etc basically look new. One annoyance is that the tremolo bar has gone missing - I'll contact Ernie Ball about obtaining a replacement and hopefully get it in time to include it with the guitar - if not, I can have it sent directly to the winner's address. If for some reason I can't find one at all I'll refund $30 to the winner so you can hopefully pick up one on EBay at some point. The case has only a few scuffs - I'll ship the guitar in the case, with a box around the case with some bubble wrap/other padding between the box and guitar case. I'll ship within a day or two of the auction ending so (if you're in the continental US) you'll have it before Christmas. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer. Free shipping to the continental US! On Dec-10-18 at 19:57:17 PST, seller added the following information: UPDATE: an Ernie Ball rep responded to my request for info on the guitar.
