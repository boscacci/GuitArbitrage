{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1960's Valco Supro Airline Vista-Tone Pickup #3- NO RESERVE! Ralph Keller single coil Valco pickup. These pickups have a tone that is unique to them. If you've never heard of them try Google or YouTube to get an idea of what they sound like. I bought this for a project that never got off the ground (please see my other items) so I never used it. Silver cover, reads 9.57K on my multi-meter. Due to age item is sold AS-IS with no returns. Comes with cream pickup surround/mount. This is a new reproduction item and not from the 1960's. This item is sold AS-IS, no returns. I have attempted to describe this item as best as possible. Please contact me with any questions or additional photos! I am using eBay's shipping calculator. Winning bidder will pay for shipping. Alaska and Hawaii will be extra. Local pickup is allowed. I will not ship this item out of the United States. No international bidders please! Again, this is an AS-IS item that has no return. Please see all pictures and ask all questions prior to bidding. Thanks!

I tapped on the cover with a screwdriver and got sound, so it should work good for your project!", "ItemID": "173637843525", "EndTime": "2018-11-20T03:48:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-13T03:48:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1960s-Valco-Supro-Airline-Vista-Tone-Pickup-3-NO-RESERVE-/173637843525", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Tampa, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736378435258080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IdMAAOSw1hJb6kk3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UcwAAOSwKO5b6kk2/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/awoAAOSwqLRb6kk1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UnYAAOSw-4Jb6kk1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rzcAAOSw-FRb6kk3/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QHoAAOSwhJFb6kk1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4LUAAOSwxxVb6kk1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33612", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cwp0126", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 339, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 11, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 109.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 109.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 138}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1960's Valco Supro Airline Vista-Tone Pickup #3- NO RESERVE!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Supro"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 131, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 112.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
