{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Squier Stratocaster VII Standard 7 string guitar hardtail The only seven string guitar I play now is my Universe, so I am cleaning out all of the other seven string guitars and pickups that I have collected over the years. I had several of these great Stratocaster VII seven strings. Fender made them in the early 2000\u2019s in various configurations. Seven-string Stratocasters are hard to find. I am selling both versions: with a trem and with a hardtail. Both of them are in very close to factory stock condition. This listing is for the sunburst with hardtail. These guitars are fun to play and fun to be seen with. People start to notice that something seems odd about your Strat; but it is hard to tell you are playing a seven string since all the tuners are in a row. The stock pickups sound good on a clean setting, but can be a little on the muddy end of the spectrum under metal distortion (Sentient/Nazgul or Alpha/Omega pickup sets would be super in these guitars). I am also listing Epiphone Les Paul Standard seven strings produced about the same time, and they sound like they have the same humbuckers. This guitar is a used vintage instrument, so it has some small dents and scratches, including a dent/scratch on the neck plate and slight thin white scrapes on the bottom edge near the jack, but otherwise is in good shape for its age. The low B chrome saddle was replaced with a synthetic saddle by a prior owner; I do not know why. Here is your chance to pick up one of these rare Stratocaster VII seven strings that play like a nice Strat but give you extra range whether you play jazz or metal. It comes in a Warwick Rockcase soft-side case. I am working hard to skinny down my instrument and parts collection to only the pieces I need for playing/recording, so I will be listing more musical equipment & accessories often. If you are only purchasing one item, please pay within three days of the auction ending. I would like to keep things pleasant and avoid reporting anyone as a non-payer. *** If you plan on bidding on or win more than one auction, consider waiting to pay and sending me a message detailing your bidding plans. Once all of the auctions you are interested in are over, I can combine everything on one invoice for you so you will have a lower shipping cost if I can ship all of the items together. Large items like guitars will each be shipped in separate boxes.*** Bidders with less than 10 transactions will have their bids cancelled. I have repeatedly seen people open an account, bid and win an item, and then disappear and never pay for what they have won, which is not fair to the honest bidders. I will ship guitars to you for $50.00 in addition to the purchase price. It has been costing me between $50 and $65 to ship guitars (including the Ebay/paypay fee), so I charge you the minimum. If it costs me more to ship to you, I just eat the extra cost to keep it simple. This item is sold in AS IS condition. It is a used guitar and will likely have small dents, scratches, and pick marks. I have attempted to document the physical condition in the photographs and show all items that are included, so please check them carefully. If a gig bag or case is not shown in guitar photos or mentioned in the listing, it is not included, but all items will be carefully bubble wrapped, buried in packing peanuts, and packaged carefully. It may take me up to 3 days to get your item packed and submitted to USPS or UPS. All shipping is to Ebay/Paypal USA 48 states registered addresses only. I will happily answer any questions you may have.ALL SALES ARE FINAL. NO RETURNS, so please be sure you want each item.
