{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is an early Jackson RR24. What makes this guitar rare is that it is from the first run of these guitars that were fitted with the reverse inlays with a non-reversed headstock. The stock photos for this guitar shows normal inlays. Some on the internet has said that the reverse inlays were a factory error that only occurred during the first run. Others have said that it was a limited edition run. The number I've heard most is that there are only around 75 of these ever made, though I've heard numbers ranging from 50 to 300. This guitar is in near perfect condition. There appears to be one scuff on one of the points, but it doesn't even break the finish. I first noticed it while taking pictures of the guitar for this listing. There is some minor corrosion on the Floyd Rose bridge clamping blocks and screws. These parts are available and inexpensive if the winner of this auction wants to replace those items. This guitar plays great. I own quite a few guitars, and this one is one of my favorite playing guitars. I stopped playing music for a while, but set this guitar up to play a few weeks ago. That's when I discovered that my pinky turns down the volume knob while I'm playing. I have a few guitars that I've had this issue with, and my solution was always to rewire the guitar to use one less knob and move the volume knob. This guitar only has one knob, so there's nowhere to relocate it. Given the rarity and collectibility of this guitar, I didn't want to modify it and instead bought a different 24 fret Rhoads model with multiple knobs to replace it. The replacement plays great, but this guitar beats it. This guitar was made in Japan, but played every bit as good as the American RR1 my former bandmate owned. The EMG 81 on this guitar sounds great, and the guitar screams with harmonics. The Floyd Rose bridge stays in tune. I'd be playing this guitar in practice and on stage if the volume knob wasn't in the way. But, it's time for someone else to enjoy this guitar.
