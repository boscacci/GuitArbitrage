{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "YAMAHA PACIFICA-1511MS #Natural / Electric Guitar w/ Softcase made in 1996 Item Description Manufacturer: YAMAHA Model: PACIFICA-1511MSB Age: 1996 Japan brand \"YAMAHA\" with a reputation for making things that only sense the accuracy. That attitude is also going through guitar production. That fan has expanded to the world wide, and is loved by musicians all over the world rather than Japan.Speaking of Yamaha 's electric guitar, I guess that there are many people who think of the SG series, but as another major pillar, earnings are likely to settle down to being Pacifica.Duncan's 59 NL is installed in the front pickup, and STHR 1 C is installed in the rear. As we see it in conjunction with the neck to which Sarasara's satin fin is applied, we insist that \"anything you can play, husband!\"Although there is picking scratch, it does not seem to be safe to say that it is a beautiful item without conspicuous paint peeling. Please consider by all means as soon as possible.Pickup: Passive pickup configuration: HH Fret number: 22 Fret neck scale: Long body material: Ash tremolo: None Finger plate material: Maple neck joint: Detachable (bolt on) Neck material: Maple Accessory: Soft case", "ItemID": "113562304390", "EndTime": "2019-01-16T22:21:58.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-16T03:06:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/YAMAHA-PACIFICA-1511MS-Natural-Electric-Guitar-w-Softcase-made-1996-/113562304390", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Japan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1135623043908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUwWDExMzQ=/z/-rIAAOSwyApcPp6A/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFg5NjA=/z/c2YAAOSwTxJcPp53/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUwWDExMzQ=/z/kYQAAOSwYX9cPp57/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUwWDExMzQ=/z/aRkAAOSwxx1cPp5u/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUwWDExMzQ=/z/rv0AAOSw-QxcPp5s/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODUwWDExMzQ=/z/ZowAAOSwpppcPp5y/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tresurejapan", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 68, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 95.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 439.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 439.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 161}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "YAMAHA PACIFICA-1511MS #Natural / Electric Guitar w/ Softcase made in 1996", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["YAMAHA"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["JPACIFICA-1511MS"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 30, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1630866429", "StoreName": "tresurejapan"}, "Country": "JP", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money back or replacement (buyer's choice)", "ReturnsWithin": "60 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["BO", "PE", "IQ", "TR", "YE", "AZ", "JP", "TJ"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The state of this guitar is A, it is a beautiful guitar.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
