{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Very cool limited edition run sparkle stratocaster. This is a rare guitar that keeps going up in value and will make a nice addition to any collection. Or better yet, play it live and make sure the audience takes notice.Now good pictures won't even give this guitar's finish any justice. You have to see it in person to believe it.Overall, the body on this guitar is in fantastic condition. I only found two very small dings that are very hard to see. There is one on the top bout of the body and one on the side that you can't see, but you can feel it.The neck is also in very good shape with just a couple of very small dings here and there. The back on the neck also has a small indent which you won't feel while you are playing.The bridge is completely brand new and the original electronics have been upgraded to alnico 5 60's style pickups with creme covers (nice full vintage sound). Creme knobs, creme tip, creme whammy bar, mint green pickguard, and mint backplate. 250k CTS pots and orange drop .022uf capacitor. All of the wiring was done with stranded chandler 20awg wire.The tone controls are not wired like your standard strat. On a standard strat, the middle tone controls the neck pup, and the bottom tone controls the middle pup. On this guitar, the middle tone controls the bridge pup, and the bottom tone controls the middle and neck pups. I like having a tone control for the bridge pup since it sometimes can be a bit overbearing. Playingwise, this guitar is fantastic. Nice comfortable action without any buzzing/dead spots. String bending is very easy. Hardly any fret-wear whatsoever.This strat has got some beef to it. \u20038lbs and 6ozThis will ship with a required signature, full insurance, and either ups or fed ex ground. Comes with a gator hsc, allen wrenches, and whammy bar.", "ItemID": "183615578628", "EndTime": "2019-01-04T00:34:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T17:09:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-FSR-Orange-Sparkle-Stratocaster-2010-w-hsc-and-upgraded-electronics-/183615578628", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Collinsville, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836155786288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5NFg3MjQ=/z/PfoAAOSwG6tcK53X/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9jUAAOSwbKdcK52D/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kNgAAOSwwSJcK52C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/28YAAOSwmXpcK52C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PNoAAOSwH1pcK52E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/q28AAOSw0YlcK52E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xyYAAOSwAQVcK52C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ElgAAOSwOShcK52C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nnIAAOSwAThcK52E/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gp0AAOSw84ZcK522/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8rUAAOSw6hNcK523/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ZdQAAOSwZwdcK52C/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "62234", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dongeomac", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 731, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 650.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 24}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender FSR Orange Sparkle Stratocaster 2010 w/hsc and upgraded electronics", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Special Run"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["FSR Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunfire Orange Flake"]}]}, "HitCount": 108, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
