{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is stock as it was custom built by Carvin in 1993 to my exact specifications. It has a Wilkinson Tremolo and Sperzel Locking Tuners which are awesome! I did change the pickups to a \"Les Paul\" configuration with Gibson 490R/498T in the neck and bridge positions. It was professionally wired, so all of the controls, including the phase switch work just like they did with the Carvin original pickups. I will include the original stock pickups (CR-22s) with the purchase. As mentioned above this guitar has been in a lot of different places and survived gracefully. The cosmetic issues with the finish are generally small dings, maybe some belt buckle rash on the back, but nothing that compromised the clear coat. The gold plating on the tremolo has some rust. If this is not your cup of tea, I totally understand, but this guitar still plays like it did when I got it back in 1993. This guitar has a great low action, the neck is a longer scale length (25 inch) and 24 medium jumbo frets. About the DC400 - Solid body 6 string with neck-through the body for better sustain...maple neck, ebony fingerboard, Quilted Maple top and matching headstock (clear on this one) abalone block inlays. The electronics include phase switch and coil splitters. The tremolo has both a floating and locking feature.", "ItemID": "173545476726", "EndTime": "2019-01-29T06:16:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-09-20T11:09:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Carvin-DC400-Quilted-Maple-Custom-Built-Left-Handed-Guitar-1993-/173545476726", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Taylors, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1735454767268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lOkAAOSwcqZbbNJf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BoEAAOSwSwpbbNJ9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/L74AAOSwUqJbbNJY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ApIAAOSwcmBbbNJH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6nMAAOSw5xpbbM38/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/r5QAAOSwPxVbbM4C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/n5AAAOSw6HNbbM4I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MU4AAOSwQc5bbM4Q/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/UfsAAOSw3opbbM4U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JiQAAOSwdYNbbNKX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29687", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tdd45", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 161, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 179}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Carvin DC400 Quilted Maple Custom Built Left Handed Guitar 1993", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Carvin"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1993"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 1598, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar is a real life relic!
