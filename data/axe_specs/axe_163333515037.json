{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Great playing and sounding Les Paul. Gibson should use these when crafting their Gibson line. Tunes perfectly with zero intonation problems . This is a dark back Gold top I would estimate the weight in the 8-9 lb area. I have tried to do the best in photographing the blemishes . There are zero issues with this guitar . I would recommend putting in Gibson Burst buckers and maybe a wiring harness with bumblebee caps and you would have a guitar worth 4K or more for 1/4 the price. You would have a really nice Gold top while saving yourself a fortune. The neck isn\u2019t the fattest or the thinnest but I would put it on the compfotably thin side. These are solid guitars and are better than many Gibson\u2019s I\u2019ve owned. Way better in some cases . If it said Gibson on the headstock it would be an honor to that product line. The action is low with no buzz and currently strung with 10-46. I believe it\u2019s production is June 96 . I\u2019m not the original owner and I picked this one up to bring into atmospheres that would afford me some piece of mind without worrying about an accident ....too much. I haven\u2019t added any scratches that weren\u2019t there when I bought it a few years back. This is a very satisfying guitar to play and will probably make you question why you would ever spend more money just for a name. Very impressive in so many ways but I\u2019m no longer using this instrument so it just sits waiting for the next part of its journey to begin. I anticipate shipping to cost about $130 for professional job so shipping will be set at $100 for USA. No international buyers unless you have a shipping service or export company with a USA address I can ship to. I will not be shipping internationally .", "ItemID": "163333515037", "EndTime": "2018-10-31T20:13:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-24T20:13:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/orville-les-paul-standard-Gold-top-/163333515037", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Beverly Hills, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1633335150378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/KicAAOSw-eJb0MqO/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/T~EAAOSwmBhb0Mqm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Cl4AAOSwCsRb0Mqj/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/60QAAOSwYi5b0Mqn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1ssAAOSwE1xb0Mqn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YsIAAOSw1iVb0Mqn/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5LEAAOSwzGBb2dz4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LToAAOSwYihb2dz4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AP8AAOSwX6Rb2dz4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/srcAAOSwhZ5b2dz6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zLQAAOSwNpRb2dz7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H~QAAOSwSlpb2dz4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34465", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "luapidnic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 666, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 95.0}, "BidCount": 4, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 786.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 786.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 452}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "orville les paul standard Gold top", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany", "Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Orville by Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fujigen Orville by Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}]}, "HitCount": 312, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 796.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
