{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "2006 Gibson SG Standard. Condition is Used. This is a great guitar! I bought this guitar a little over a year ago, and played it fairly often. It is still in great condition. All original, no modification (none needed imo) No neck breaks or repairs. Frets still have lots of life left. Currently has 11s and the action is good. Some swirl marks on the finish, but nothing major. Nitro finish has aged well, and will continue to do so. The hard shell case is in good condition as well. No broken latches, handle, and the lock works. I few knicks here and there on the case and the guitar, but overall in very good condition for being almost 15 years old. I hate to see this one go, but I need to slim down the collection. Guitar will be packaged for shipping very carefully. No Returns Look at photos before buying, I\u2019ve tried my best to capture the guitar.
