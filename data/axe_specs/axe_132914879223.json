You are looking at a 2017 Jackson RR24 Pro Series Rhoads Electric Guitar. This is a Randy Rhoads Pro Series Signature Model. Very Cool Charcoal Gray Satin Finish. From The Web: The Jackson Pro Series Rhoads RR24 solidbody electric guitar is packed with aggressive visuals, fast-playing performance, and ferocious sound. Dual Seymour Duncan humbuckers supply savage high-output tone that beautifully enhances the resonance of this guitar's mahogany body. And you'll experience a serious speed boost to your playing, thanks to the RR24's oil-finished maple neck. Whammy and dive-bomb to your heart's content with a Floyd Rose double-locking tremolo. The Jackson Pro Series Rhoads models continue the metal legacy pioneered by the immortal Randy Rhoads. Regal and proud, the Pro Rhoads RR24 emanates attitude, both sonically and visually. The RR24 offers premium features including a mahogany body (ash top on Charcoal Gray), one-piece through-body maple neck with hand-rubbed oil back finish, graphite reinforcement and wrap-around comfort heel, and a 12\u201d-16\u201d compound radius ebony fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets and sharkfin inlays. Enjoy hotter and more aggressive tone than ever before from a pair of Seymour Duncan Distortion humbucking pickups (SH-6N neck/TB-6 bridge) that can be further shaped by single volume and tone controls and three-way blade switch. The sensitive Floyd Rose\u00ae 1000 Series recessed double-locking tremolo adds expressive vibrato to notes and chords, along with rock-solid tuning performance and precise intonation.Tech Specs Body Type: Solidbody Body Shape: Rhoads V Left-/Right-handed: Right-handed Number of Strings: 6 Body Material: Mahogany Top Material: Ash Body Finish: Satin Color: Natural Neck Material: 1-piece Maple Neck Shape: Neck-thru Radius: 12\"-16\" compound Fingerboard Material: Ebony Fingerboard Inlay: Alumiloid Sharkfin Number of Frets: 24, Jumbo Scale Length: 25.5\" Nut Width: 1.6875\" Nut Material: Locking nut Bridge/Tailpiece: Floyd Rose FRT-O2000 Double-locking Tremolo Recessed Tuners: Jackson sealed die-cast Neck Pickup: Duncan SH-6n Humbucker Bridge Pickup: Duncan TB-6 Distortion Humbucker Controls: 1 x volume, 1 x tone, 3-way toggle pickup switch Our luthier did a complete setup.
