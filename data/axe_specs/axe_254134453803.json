{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Carvin Contour 66 (C66) Guitar with Beautiful Spalted Maple Top. Condition is Used. Really, really great quality here without the price tag of a Suhr or Tom Anderson guitar. This is in excellent condition, and has never left the confines of my household. Now that Carvin is now Kiesel, and this model discontinued, it will become increasingly more rare as time goes on. *Mahogany body*Spalted maple top and headstock*Natural Finish*Ebony fretboard w/custom inlays*22 medium jumbo frets*Sperzel locking tuners*Wilkinson tremoloIncludes original Carvin hardshell case and trem bar. This priced out to about $1600-1700 plus sales tax and shipping on the Carvin builder. Hasn't been played in a couple of years. May need some light setup work for your liking and a new battery for active pickups. Shoot me a message with any questions or offers. Thanks!
