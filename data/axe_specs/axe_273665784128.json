{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Beautiful Early Fender USA Prodigy w Case: serial # N1 001647, made in the US. These were only produced for a couple years and this one is one of the earliest. They are fairly rare and getting more difficult to find in nice condition. This one is not mint, but has never been abused and has only modest play wear (mainly small dings on the bottom, a spot on the 5th fret, and a little finger? wear on the sides of the fretboard). The pearl white pick guard and back plate look gorgeous. As the pictures show, she is still beautiful :-). The neck is sweet with vgood frets and easy playing low action. I just cleaned it and installed a new set of Slinky 10s and it is ready to rock. Pretty powerful pickups have nice bite and everything works as it should. Includes a Fender guitar strap and a near new Roadrunner case. As with all our fine instruments, we understand the bond between player and instrument and always offer a 30 day play/return policy with No restocking fee.
