{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Washburn J6S Montgomery in excellent clean undamaged condition. No dents or gashes or even an official scratch. Clean body, great feeling, neck super nice with very very minimal fret wear, (essentially none but I say this out of being overly cautious about the condition), very solid build. The workmanship is IMO outstanding (I have owned 2 Gibson L5s). Top is Spruce arched, and Flamed Sycamore back and sides nice looking wood. Maple neck, rosewood fingerboard, set neck, 648mm scale 43mm nutclassic humbuckers, grover tuners, all gold plated hardware, (with very minor plating wear on the bridge pickup) individual volume and tone. Pickup switch for 3 way options (==>> switch may need to be cleaned). The tailpiece is a replacement and there is a custom pickguard not original that it well made. Comes with 5 latch plush higher end Washburn HSC made for this body that's worth about $129 . Shipping is by Fedex home which is least expensive. I have played it for about 5 hours total, selling it because I'm selling my house and moving have to downsize. PLEASE NOTE: I have had issues in the past with the way eBay shipping calculators work I RESERVE THE RIGHT to ask for the actual cost of the shipping if ebay's calculator is low.
