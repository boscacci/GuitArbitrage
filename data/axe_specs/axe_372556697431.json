{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ok Collectors, Musicians, Metal heads. We have a very rare find here. This is an original 1979 Gibson Flying V Made famous as the same year, make and model, that is played by Metallica's Kirk Hammett. Also Favorite year for Rudolf Schenker of the scorpions and his B/W signature model is modeled after this same flying V . This one is in a very desirable cream color. Ok so this has been checked over by our guitar expert here in Cheyenne. He states that it it plays very nice no issues with the performance of this piece what so ever, also stated that for its age it is in beautiful condition. There is some buckle rash but nothing that goes through the finish, and there is a couple little chips in the top edge by the tuning knobs see pics. This is a factory Second, the reason for the Second is some darker discoloration on the edge of the neck were the white is a bit darker brown \"also in the pics\" The 3 position selector switch was moved to just below the second pick up and the moved back to its original position at some point, there is a plastic plug that covers the hole. Also taken are pictures with the pick guard removed so you can see that it was done tastefully and is not a hack job. A new pick guard would fix this issue. Also the 3 wires that go to this switch are not original due to the fact that the switch was moved. All other internals are original see pics. Included are the original case that is in pretty good condition all hinges and latches work as they should as well as the original keys for the case. there are some dings in the outside of the case but overall good condition. You will also receive the original paper work and warranty information as well. Again this item was inspected by a professional Guitar repair and restorer and has been given a clean bill of health, and for its age is a very nice guitar. Not a once in a lifetime item, but you will be waiting a long time to find another in this condition. Buy confidently. This item will ship free ground to the lower 48 states.
