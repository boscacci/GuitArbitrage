{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx,no post office boxes. I will not ship anywhere else. Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". I have added a new part to my ending statement.I now recommend that all the guitars I sell be set up to your preferences. ALL GUITARS MAY REQUIRE SET UP!!! Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Humbucker/P90 Tele\". The maple neck is has had a very nice headstock makeover with many coats of clear over the decal. Near zero fret wear . The bridge is a modern string through the body six saddle bridge. The very cool Lake Placid Blue body is in excellent condition, just mild surface scratches. The pickups are an Epiphone P90 in the neck position[about 9k]. The bridge is a rail type humbucker at a whopping 16k. Next I added a push/pull tone control so that the bridge humbucker can be split into a single coil. I also upgraded the tone capacitor with a nice Japanese mylar film capacitor . All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. These pickups sound very good on this guitar. Action is good and this Tele packs a punch. Please look carefully at all the pictures,they are part of the description too. This one sounds very good. A very cool guitar period! I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period. Make sure to look at all pictures carefully,ask all question before you bid! All sales are final,and there will be no refunds, or returns unless you can prove an item was grossly misrepresented.
