{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a very nice Washburn model HB-35 semi hollow arc top electric guitar. In very good condition with very little scratches (just small hair line scratches), no damage or repairs have been done to it. There is a little paint pealing crack were the neck is connected but the neck is still on there and not pulling away from the body and is sturdy. All original in the original case. The case is excellent on the inside but kind of beat up on the outside. There have been stickers put on the case and removed, some of the black outer lining is coming off and the bottom latch will not latch because it is missing the loop, but still a durable case hard shell case. From the research done to this guitar it was made around or on 1989. It was made in Japan and is Washburns more higher quality guitars. It is heavy and well made. The hardware was gold plated and does show wear but normal for a guitar this old. I believe the pickups are PAF pickups because they sound really good with nice distortion. The guitar has low action and easy to play. All the electronics work great. The selector switch is reversed meaning the lever is switched to the top for the bridge pickup. The neck is straight and the frets are in great condition. There is no humming of the guitar. The sticker inside reads\"HB-35 serial 8106 Hand Crafted in the Washburn Tradition of Chicago\".
