Series version uses a solid hardwood body topped with a bound quilt maple image top. The neck and body are mated with the same 5-bolt neck joint found on the Silo3. Sculpted and contoured for a super comfortable joint that allows easy access to the upper register. Asymmetrical neck carve on AX4 is sublime and has enough girth for grip and is thin enough for easy playability. The 25.5? scale maple neck and fingerboard has 22 medium-sized frets and is super easy to play. The neck is seamlessly integrated to the body. Two high-output \"Zebra\" coil humbucking pickups are direct mounted to the body. The special wiring of these pickups offer five distinct, versatile tones via the five-way selector switch. Different combinations yield chicken pickin' single-coil tones to throaty, huge humbucking rock tones. Single volume and tone controls. Its all there in one guitar.
