{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is a 2007 PRS Custom 24. The guitar is in amazing condition, but there is damage to the headstock. The guitar was on a stage and was accidentally knocked over by a careless assistant and the headstock received the damage. The left horn was fractured as you can see in the pictures. I had the guitar looked at by my luthier (Karricker Customs) and they informed me that luckily there was no further damage other that the piece on the tip of the headstock that was damaged. The neck structure is perfect, the neck mount is perfect, truss rod etc...all checked out A.OK. He approximated the repair to replace that piece at approximately $200-$250 dollars. This would include the repair as well as the refinishing. I am the original owner and this guitar was purchased new in 2007 an other than this hiccup the guitar is in great shape!!!!! PRS guitars are some of finest guitars ever built. This guitar has an \"owie\", but it is 100% structurally sound and other than that hiccup it is aesthetically beautiful! If you have always wanted a PRS now is your opportunity to get one. Once this is repaired this thing will be brand new again! PLEASE SEE PICTURES FOR DETAILS. Also, please see my feedback.. Thanks for looking and good luck with your bidding!", "ItemID": "292923885332", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T04:41:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-18T04:41:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-PRS-Paul-Reed-Smith-Custom-24-/292923885332", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Roseville, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929238853328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/ZmkAAOSwZupcQTSp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TaEAAOSw-yJcQS4o/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TBMAAOSwQqNcQS40/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Ui0AAOSwy3JcQS45/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RhYAAOSwZV1cQS5A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/79sAAOSwW4tcQS5G/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aZQAAOSwdxFcQS5M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/JvcAAOSwJOJcQS5U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8QwAAOSwN3NcQS5a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/aNAAAOSw-sVcQVZ9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/9KIAAOSwGUpcQVVr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/As0AAOSw5tNcQVZh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "95678", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aggriff1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 45, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 83}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 PRS Paul Reed Smith Custom 24", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2009"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom 24"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 670, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1224.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "The guitar is in amazing shape but there is damage to the headstock.
