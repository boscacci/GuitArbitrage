{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Telecaster Thinline Cabronita -- in the rare white blonde finish! The original neck has been replaced with a brand new authentic Fender maple neck with locking tuners. Electronics: The stock pickups were replaced with TV Jones Classic Filtertrons, which sound AMAZING, and the wiring was replaced with a concentric tone and volume pot. The pickup selector switch is a chrome Les Paul-style switch. Bigsby: This guitar has had a Bigsby B5 vibrato tailpiece added, and the stock bridge was replaced with a Callaham. The guitar can be set up to be string-thru, as it is now, or you can use the Bigsby. To help with tuning stability when using the Bigsby, I added locking tuners and roller string trees up top. The Bigsby arm was removed while I was playing it as a string-thru, but all components are included in this sale. I will set the guitar up with the Bigsby prior to shipping if you want. I am a hobbyist guitar player, not a store. I cannot accept returns. Please ask all questions prior to bidding. I ship all my guitars fully insured and professionally packed. This guitar includes a gig bag. The stock specs are below, please see above for all the modifications!
