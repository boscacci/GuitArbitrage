{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is a Beautiful Gibson ES-339 Guitar in Excellent condition ready to play. The guitar has been rarely played and kept securely in its case in a climate controlled enviroment when not. It has been extremely well cared for never gigged, and has never left the house. This model is light and very versatile with an awesome warm tone that semi hollows provide. I have checked all functionality prior to listing. The guitar is set up nicely with great intonation, low action and sounds awesome. I may be selling a couple more guitars in the next few months as I need to thin the collection a bit more. Besides, this guitar needs to be played and appreciated for its playability and beauty. I have sold many of my guitars here on EBay with nothing less than an excellent rating as I take pride in what I list. If there are any questions please contact me and I will get back with you as soon as possible with an answer. The Guitar will be packed and shipped Immediately with extreme care. Ships to continental US only! Thanks for looking! FEATURES F-hole emblem engraved truss rod cover: The iconic symbol of the Gibson ES line is now the hallmark of Gibson Memphis.
