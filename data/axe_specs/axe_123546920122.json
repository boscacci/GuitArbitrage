{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A 2005 Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster with the 3-color sunburst and a dark rosewood neck. Aside from being a totally awesome guitar in excellent shape, this Strat is quite a bit lighter than normal. An important and valuable attribute if you play for extended periods of time. If you are not familiar with the difference between an American Standard and the American Deluxe then allow me to enlighten you. The neck on this guitar is a soft \"C\" profile with additional work on the frets and the edges to make this guitar much more comfortable to play. The tuning keys are all locking which makes string changing much easier and faster. The fret markers (i.e. dots) are abalone instead of the standard clay ones. There is a cutaway on the body in the neck pocket which makes it much easier to access the higher frets. The bridge hardware is polished chrome so as to upgrade the aesthetics. The pickups are noiseless and were developed specifically for the S1 switching system. The top of the volume knob is a button that can be used to dramatically alter the sound achieved with the pickups. Cosmetically this guitar is about as pristine as it gets. I've owned it since new and it is always stored in the G&G tweed case when not being played. Never exposed to any kind of smoke filled environment. The neck is dead straight, the frets showing negligible wear, and no damage or issues whatsoever. Though not pictured, the tremolo bar is included as well. I currently have it set up to play 10s or 9.5s with the action being nice and low with no fret buzz at all. I'll answer any questions with the understanding that I'll only be able to do so in the evening hours. This truly is an awesome guitar and it kills me to sell it but ya' gotta do what ya' gotta do.", "ItemID": "123546920122", "EndTime": "2019-01-19T13:27:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-16T06:12:27.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2005-Fender-American-Deluxe-Stratocaster-Excellent-Condition-and-Very-Light-/123546920122", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Jackson, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235469201228080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/s-kAAOSwOt5cFeaI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/oXkAAOSwVcZcFeax/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/g-MAAOSwRWZcFea0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/RPkAAOSwkDtcFeaz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/UYEAAOSwrAFcFea0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/6zYAAOSwzwVcFea0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/rwUAAOSwuNNcFea0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/LBEAAOSwUalcFea0/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/bLIAAOSwxtVcFeaW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "63755", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wtoliver7515", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 291, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 927.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 927.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 343}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2005 Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster - Excellent Condition and Very Light!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2005"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster American Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 249, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
