THIS GUITAR WAS NEARLY COMPLETELY COVERED WITH STICKERS WHEN IT CAME TO ME, THE ORIGINAL NECK WAS BRUSH PAINTED AND WAY DAMAGED and ONLY ONE PICKUP WORKED. THE CASE IS SCUFFED UP AROUND THE EDGES BUT THE HINGE and ALL THREE LATCHES WORK. IT IS STRUCTURALLY SOUND AND THE INTERIOR IS IN REALLY GOOD CONDITION. THIS GUITAR WEIGHS IN AT 8.5 POUNDS. THE SCRATCH PLATES STILL HAVE THE PROTECTIVE PLASTIC COVERING ON THEM. I THOUGHT THIS GUITAR WAS WORTH SAVING AND TO BE HONEST, I LIKE THIS STRAT BETTER THAN MOST OF THE MIM STRATS I'VE OWNED.
