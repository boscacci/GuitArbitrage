Se tu non sai bene l'inglese, cioe' non capisci bene la descrizione di sotto, non esitare a chiedermi qualsiasi domanda in italiano!! Parlo io italiano (ma non molto bene), quindi provo di risponderti nella lingua vostra/ in italiano!! Grazie. Thank you for looking at my auction! This auction is for a Grover Jackson Made In Japan Rare Randy Rhoads Mini Amp & Speaker. This is an ultimate go-anywhere, play-anytime travel electric guitar, with a full scale (24 inch / 610 mm), a built-in amplifier, and a speaker (powered by 9 volt battery). There are too many brand names associated with Jackson, such as Charvel, Jackson Stars, Jackson, Grover Jackson and more, so it is quite hard to tell when they made, but \"Grover Jackson\" (not Jackson\\Grover Jackson) logo was started to used in 1995 when Chusin gakki took over the distribution rights from Kyowa Shokai. Chusin gakki hadn't been a trading company but a manufacture but they started to sell the guitars made in their factory in Nagano, Japan. After the new bend name, \"Jackson Stars\" emerged in 1999, \"Grover Jackson\" logo gradually faded from the market. Chushin Gakki is not so well known as Fujigen and Matsumoku but they made good quality guitars too. All of Charvel guitars including this model made between 1986 - 2002 were manufactured by them. After Fender purchased the Charvel brand, USA made models have returned, but Chushin Gakki continued to product some models till 2011. Unfortunately the company went bankrupt in the year. The last two digits of the serial number in the pictures is hidden for the sake of the next owner. There seems to be a contact failure on the battery box, so when you replace the battery, you need to close the box carefully holding the state that the electric current carries. It should be fixed if you have the battery box replaced. There is a sound like moving sands from the inside of the included case, I cannot figure out what they are. There seems to be a kind of boards inside to protect the guitar, so I think the some parts of the boards have been broken into pieces inside of the case. Regarding the manufacturing country, I believe that the item is made in Japan, but I don\u2019t have any official certification so please judge if it is so (or not) for yourself by seeing all the pictures or by info on the internet and so on. Specs Body: looks Alder or Basswood Neck: looks Maple + unknown Neck shape: rather slim Neck width at nut: approx. 41.5 mm /1.63 in Weight: approx. 3.2 kg / 7.06 lbScale length: 610 mm / 24 in **The specs above are extracted from the catalog or are based on my research, so they could be misinformed or mistaken.

Condition of the item **Please refer to the photos & ++TERMS/CONDITION OF ITEM++ section below regarding guitar condition. The neck looks straight and the truss rod works fine. The fretboard is smooth and fine. The frets show minimal wear for its age. Tuners work fine. The electrics are good but the item is not brand new and some of the electric parts might have got to work after a contact cleaner had been sprayed on them so they might need to be fixed or to be replaced at your expense after you purchase; in some cases as soon as you receive the item. Or at least they might have a slight scratchy sound which can removed by a contact cleaner. There are some blemishes, dents, scratches and so on, as you can see the pictures but on the whole you could say that the guitar is in excellent condition. (There are some more blemishes, dents, scratches and so on that cannot be identified by photos because they are so slight, shallow or small. ) There could be some crack(s) especially near the neck joint part that could often generated on used guitars. I cannot judge how it/they is/are deep as I don\u2019t know how to do that, but most of them should be only on the paint. Unless I don\u2019t think it/ they that could affect the stability, I won\u2019t describe them for most of the cases but I always try to take the pictures of the cracks, so please check the pictures both at the top and at the bottom of this item description, and then please judge the condition for yourself. Some wood screw holes of the item could be loose as well as those of many other old or used guitars/basses.

If you don't accept all of them then please do not bid or purchase. Condition of the guitar: Almost all of the guitars in my store are not a brand new, but a used one, so they are not always be in \"PERFECT\" condition. This can be especially true of \"VINTAGE\" guitars that have had many years of use and because of this they can sometimes have issues with playability, so for many reasons they may need care and maintenance before reaching an optimal playing condition. Please read the following detailed information that should always be considered when buying a used guitar. *NeckNowadays a lot of guitar players know the term \"JV\" (Japan Vintage) and that the values of guitars made in and around the JV era are getting higher. I am glad and proud as a Japanese person that these guitars were made by expert craftsmen with selected materials and I totally agree with the reputation that these guitars have earned. However, in Japan, there is a significant humidity difference through the year which can have a bad influence on the materials in guitars if they are not well kept & carefully maintained. Additionally these guitars were often purchased by beginners or students and can tend to be poorly treated without ever having any maintenance. Sometimes they are stored away for ages after a very short period of use, as a result it is often the case that they have issue's about the neck. I have played guitar for many years and all the guitars in my store were listed only after I checked & played them personally. All of the guitars in my store passed the normal standards/my standards unless particularly stated otherwise. However that does not mean \"perfect\" condition as most guitars in the world have some issue be it a scratch or a break. Additionally, the pressure change, humidity change and change in temperature have a bad influence on the guitars during the shipping or after arriving in your country so they may need some adjustment before playing. *FretsAs the guitars are used the frets are worn more or less. I cannot say 70% or 80% left or something like that,,,,,because who can count the degree in a precise way? So please check the degree by the pictures. If the guitar needs refreting or if there is any defect with the frets (judging by my standards) it will be stated in the description. *(Fret /String) BuzzI check the Fret (String) Buzz by picking normally with light gauge strings (009-046), adjusting the bottom string height (low E) to 2.0 / 2.5 mm and the top string height (high E) to 1.8 / 2.2 mm.(For basses, the bottom string height/E to 2.8 / 3.3 mm and the top string height/G to 2.3 / 2.8 mm.)The guitars are used, so slight buzz could occur. If the fret buzz of the guitar is above the normal standard, the detail is described in the description of the guitar. Anyway, how you feel the fret buzz depends on the player, so any requests to settle repair fee is not accepted. *Cosmetic conditionAs the guitars are used, they might have a number of dents, scratches, blemishes, chips and so on. Unless they are in mint or near mint condition, you cannot describe all of them, so please judge the condition by the pictures. *Electrical partsALL the electrical parts work fine unless there is a particular fault in which case it will be mentioned in the description, but they might have a slight scratchy sound. *Tax and dutiesAs stated above, the auction winner or the buyer is responsible for any and all applicable taxes and duties levied by their government. Before placing a bid or clicking \"Buy it now\" button, please enquire with your local customs for detailed information. *ReturnPlease check the guitar within two days of it being delivered to you. If it differs significantly from the description I will accept the return. Payment made for returned goods and the outward shipping fee you paid will be refunded to you within three business days after the guitar is returned and checked by me on received. Please note that any return freight charges, taxes &/or duties you pay for returning an item are not settled. *Insurance for transportationThe insurance of EMS would cover any damage, loss or the robbery/theft of an item during transportation. The EMS insurance reimbursements might take more than a month to process. ++My Attitude toward business transactionsAs a seller, I do not want to disappoint any buyers when they receiving an item and check it. *Other conditionIf you are new to eBay and have zero feedback or have negative feedback, please contact me before bidding and provide me with your name and your email address for PayPal or your bid will be withdrawn. ++DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT SHIPPING++*To Asia (First Zone) ..............US$117 such as China (People's Rep.), Guam, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea (Rep.), Malaysia, Saipan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and so on. *To North America/Central America (Second Zone)..........US$136such as United States, Canada, Mexico and so on. *To Oceania (Second Zone).........US$136such as Australia, New Zealand and so on. *To Middle East (Second Zone) ..........US$136such as United Arab Emirates, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Bahrain, Cyprus, Jordan, Kuwait and so on. *To Europe (Second Zone)..........US$147such as Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovak, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom and so on. *To South America (Third Zone)..........US$206such as Brazil, Chile and so on.
