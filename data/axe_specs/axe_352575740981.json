When leaving feedback, ebay has added an automated 5 star rating system. This system can unfairly block a seller for 30 days or longer listing items if the winning bidder gives a low star rating. Most sellers will agree the main flaw with the DSR is including a shipping and handling rating. This cost is clearly stated in our item description. Also we are not able to control what happens once your order is in route and it is not unusual for orders to take longer than what is promised by the carrier. Most bidders aren't aware of the potential loss of income to the seller when giving a low star rating. If you choose to use this rating system. Please give 5 stars. If ever there's an issue you wish to express. It can be written in the feedback. Your cooperation and bidding is appreciated.
