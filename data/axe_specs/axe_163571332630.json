{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Telecaster American 52 Reissue was purchased in the early 1990s. It's in great shape and has a very light weight and smooth thin style neck. The frets are good and the neck is straight with no cracks. The body has several dings and chips in the clear coat n paint...and there's some darker smudges and a worn through area of clear coat where the forearm rubs during playing...all these things however, add up to the over all 25 yrs worth of character through performing this guitar has endured. It has been in a smoke free home and professionally maintained throughout the years. I am the sole owner of the guitar. There's the original tweed case with the pick up ash tray cover. Please ask questions if needed. I tried to get as many natural light and indoor lighting shots to show the true overall look of the guitar....as stated above theres 25 yrs worth of character on the guitar and I can't cover every little one obviously...It plays and sounds amazing and has been very hard to let go of. Continental US Shipping only.
