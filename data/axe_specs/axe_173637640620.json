{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage 1960's Valco Supro Airline Res-O-Glas Short Scale Guitar! Nice short scale guitar! I used used this for playing slide and this thing screams! All electronics work, one pot is slightly harder to turn than the others. Nice finish, some small scratches here and there, nothing major for a 50+ year old guitar. Original gasket is intact and in good condition, has a few smudges on it. Original rosewood bridge swapped out for tune-o-matic, you get both. Has crack in pickguard near jack. Pots were cleaned when guitar was opened up. There is a small block of wood rattling around inside of guitar. I think it is the one that attaches the top screw of the bridge pickup to the body. It is an easy fix, just needs to be glued back in place. Guitar is playable and works fine as is. This guitar is easy to open up, but getting the gasket just right takes a little bit of work. I was going to replace the sticky pot and fix the block but never got around to it. I will leave that to its new owner. New gasket is included. It is black and has never been installed. Original case included, but is not in the greatest condition. I will pack securely and ship well. This item is sold AS-IS, no returns. I have attempted to describe this item as best as possible.
