{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "THIS INSTRUMENT IS IN MINT CONDITION!As described by Sweetwater:A Combination of Two ClassicsNot every Gibson guitar traces its heritage back to the so-called \"Golden Years\" of American Guitars, which is widely accepted to be most of the 1950s and into the 1960s. The ES-137 Custom is a perfect example. Gibson never built any instrument quite like this until recently. It clearly combines two distinctive influences: The look of Gibson's single cuataway, semi-hollowbodies and the hot sound of a Les Paul Classic. Is it a blues guitar? A rock guitar? Or perhaps a jazz guitar? The answer is, it's all of these. With its feature set, it can play clean jazz or fusion lines. Crank your amp to \"11\" and it screams just like a Les Paul.Gibson ES-137 Custom at a Glance:Semi-hollowbody design with curly maple laminated top, back and sides in Tri Burst finish with multi-ply bindingRounded profile mahogany neck with an ebony fingerboard and pearl split diamond inlaysTwo '57 Classic Humbuckers plus six-position Varitone circuitryA Very Special New GibsonCan you say, \"Instant classic?\" Certainly the critics are unanimous of their praise for this instrument, with its wide array of tones, as well as the handsome lines which evoke those great old Gibson archtops, but this time in a thinner, semi-hollowbody design. It still keeps the traditional f-holes, but thanks to the thinline design, feedback is kept under control. The modern humbuckers can go from dark and smoky to full-out snarl, all depending upon your choice of amplification or outboard gear. The Tri Burst finish gives this beauty a true vintage vibe. Varitone circuitry, first seen on upscale Gibsons on the ES-345 and ES-355, is back, delivering extra voicing options. Not Too Fat, Not Too ThinNo, we're not talking about the latest fad diet, we're talking about the 1959 ES-137's neck profile. It's not as big as those huge 1958 Les Paul necks, but neither is it as thin as the 1960s so-called \"slim taper\" neck profiles. In any case, the combination of a nice, rounded three-piece maple neck and the warmth of a ebony fingerboard is what the ES-137 Custom is all about. It's not for everyone, of course. Today's shredders will want a thinner neck, but the ES-137 is hardly a guitar they'd be looking at anyhow.Two '57 Classic Humbuckers On BoardToday's humbuckers truly have it all: Complex midrange, punchy lows and a smooth top end that won't make your teeth hurt. For those seeking the often overused \"out-of-phase\" session sound which ruled the airwaves back in the 1980s, you won't find it here. If you're looking for a pickup that starts out clean and can really smoke when your amp is cranked up, well then, this just might be your next guitar! The '57 Classics are, for many, the holy grail of humbucker tone and sustain.", "ItemID": "202523033836", "EndTime": "2018-12-27T05:55:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-02T22:40:45.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-ES137-Custom-Triburst-2006-Semi-Hollow-Body-Guitar-Hard-Case-/202523033836", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Hendersonville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025230338368080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/O4oAAOSwosdcBFON/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/RwAAAOSw~llcBFOz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/yscAAOSwGD1cBFO7/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/ds4AAOSwdgxcBFPA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/Lj4AAOSw-QBcBFPD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/yIMAAOSwZwlcBFPG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/CxIAAOSwaiBcBFPa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/dw0AAOSwdgxcBFPh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQwWDQ4MA==/z/HD8AAOSwlAFcBFPt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/BvUAAOSwiwZcBFPw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37075", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rakin-1014", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1975.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 115}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson ES137 Custom Triburst 2006 Semi Hollow Body Guitar With Hard Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Curly Maple and Poplar"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-137 Custom"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 476, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
