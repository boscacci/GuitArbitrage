{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is functionally and aesthetically perfect. Recently restrung with factory default strings. Comes with factory soft bag. I think the price is fair for this guitar but you're welcome to drop me a note with lower offers, which I'll consider if relisting. The Traveler Guitar EG-1 Custom is a full 24 \u00be-inch scale electric travel guitar. The proprietary In-Body tuning system uses standard tuning machines relocated into the body to create a guitar that has a full-scale neck, yet is substantially shorter than full size electrics. The lack of a headstock and a small, ergonomic body allow the guitar to be 27% shorter and 50% lighter than a full-size electric, all while preserving the same full-scale playing experience you\u2019re used to.The guitar features active electronics with our proprietary 4-channel headphone amplifier built-in, allowing you to practice privately at full shred, without waking the neighbors. Cycle through clean, boost, overdrive and distortion tones using the custom tap-pot and listen through your headphones or favorite amp. In addition, the EG-1 Custom includes the Shadow E-tuner, a chromatic tuner built-into the pickup ring always ready to go, so you don't need to carry extra gear. The jackplate has an aux-in so you can plug in your mobile device and play along with your favorite tracks.", "ItemID": "323545102852", "EndTime": "2018-11-12T03:49:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T20:48:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Traveler-Guitar-EG-1-Gloss-Black-/323545102852", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235451028528080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p30AAOSw9m5b541w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mKsAAOSwG1Vb541w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQ2WDE2MDA=/z/cwoAAOSwnhlb541w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4VMAAOSwBJVb541w/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "33472", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aucollider", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 295, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 944}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Traveler Guitar EG-1 Gloss Black", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Traveler"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["EG-1"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Travel"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["0851885008007"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Built-in Amp", "Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 16, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 404.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
