{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "PRS McCarty 594 - Copperhead Smoke Burst The McCarty 594 is a vintage-inspired instrument that is at once incredibly familiar and effortlessly playable. Whether you are looking for rich, authentic, vintage humbucking tones or nuanced, sweet singlecoil sounds, the McCarty 594 can seamlessly master both sonic territories thanks to the 58/15 LT pickups and push/pull coil taps on the tone controls. The electronics layout, a few key specifications, and PRS craftsmanship combine in the McCarty 594 to create an instrument that plays in tune, is intonated the entire length of the neck, and feels like a guitar that you\u2019ve been playing forever. \"The 594 is the best new guitar I've played in years. It has a vintage heart and soul but without the technical limitations that usually come along with an old instrument. What good is an old guitar if you can't get all that feel out of the upper frets, or the intonation is off? To hear that old PAF sound but be able to articulate the notes in a way that only modern manufacturing could allow is so exciting.\" \u2013 John Mayer \"I think a lot of people know PRS as a company that is looking to history, innovating, and improving all at the same time. The McCarty 594 is a great example of that culture. I believe it to be a great musical instrument...quality, playability and tone. It is also, as the ad says, subtly very different. When we were developing the 594, we examined everything: the scale length, the tuners, the bridge materials, the nut material, the pickups, the neck shape...every piece of this instrument was designed to be exactly what we thought it needed to be to add up to the best instrument we could make. The final guitar, in my experience, is more than the sum of its parts. My hope is it is a source of joy and real musicality for everyone who picks one up. So far, it seems to be doing its job in that regard\" \u2013 Paul Reed Smith Specifications: Model: McCarty 594 Color: Copperhead Smoke Burst Top Wood: Carved Figured Maple Back Wood: Mahogany Number of Frets: 22 Scale Length: 24.594\" Neck Wood: Mahogany Fretboard Wood: Rosewood with Faux Bone Binding Fretboard Inlays: Birds Neck Shape: Pattern Vintage Bridge: PRS Two-Piece, Cast Zinc Tuners: Phase III Locking Tuners Hardware Type: Nickel Treble Pickup: 58/15 LT Treble Bass Pickup: 58/15 LT Bass Controls: Two Volume and Two Push/Pull Tone Controls with 3-Way Toggle Pickup Switch on Upper Bout Strings: 10's Option: 10-Top Maple (Defaults To Hybrid Hardware) SPECIAL NOTES: Includes PRS Hardhsell Case N Stuff Music is a family owned and operated business for over 45 years, N Stuff Music has provided musicians, DJs, and producers with the musical instruments and musical equipment they need to write, record, and perform their music.
