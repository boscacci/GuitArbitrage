{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "he LGX-SA (AAA) is top of the line three-voice guitar featuring electric and acoustic guitar sounds, plus the infinite possibilities provided by synth access. The output from the bridge transducer system in the LGX-SA produces six separate signals\u2014one for each string. This divided signal is called hexaphonic and is used to drive guitar synths. The LGX adapted itself to this application quite easily. However, in addition to the electronic modifications, the guitar itself was altered in order to achieve the best possible performance. The most visible difference between the standard LGX and the LGX-SA is in the ebony fingerboard. The use of the ebony fingerboard improves synth tracking. Guitar synth systems in the past were technically complicated and required radical changes in playing technique. The LGX-SA/RolandTM GR-synth combination represents a new standard in user friendliness and performance. This is truly a 'plug in and play' system. The unprecedented power of this instrument comes from its combination of electric guitar sounds, acoustic guitar sounds, and fast guitar synth tracking. This combination of fast synth tracking and a tremolo system makes for incredible sonic power and delivers it in a very user-friendly package. This is a used not a return or refurbished instrument . This particular guitar has a very minor use signgs or imperfection in the finish.
