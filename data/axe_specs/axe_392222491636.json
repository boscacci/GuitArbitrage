{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding Beautiful After Norlin let go of Gibson in 1986 the new owners made their best effort to minimize the drama about quality during the Norlin years--personally some of my favorite Gibsons came from those years but I do understand that the quality was mixedThis guitar is the first post-Norlin year and Gibson really tried to get it right for its diminishing fan base--the guitar is heavy with huge sustain and has true ebony fretboard and gold grover tuners and gold hardware--the inlays are real mop and Gibson went back to the one piece body here instead of the pancake-- The Shawss are as most people looking know a wonderful PAF humbucker and these are in full voice--from jazz to blues to rock to screaming metal they can do it all--this is the last year Gibson put Shaws in their Customs. the guitar is in very good cosmetic condition with some checking you can see in the scans and some worming on the back -- the neck is nice and the frets are excellent==there's no funky odors on the guitar or the case which is a Gibson USA logo case and I was told by the first owner that it is original. The one thing to report is that the grovers have lost most of their gold and the patina is worn with some fairly extensive pitting which I have shown in 3 different scans--the tuners work perfectly and hold tune. thanks for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling and has been intonated as well as setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392222491636",
