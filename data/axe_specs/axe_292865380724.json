{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you want to make me an offer, message me, and I can always change the \"buy it now\" price if we come to an agreement. I have too many guitars, so I am selling a few.\u00a0 This is a Gibson Les Paul Studio that I bought from a friend of mine a few years ago.\u00a0 After buying the guitar, I had my local guitar shop do a professional setup, cleaning, and re-stringing of the guitar.\u00a0 My buddy, who I bought it from - he gigged with it regularly during high school, so there are a few dings on the bottom pickup (see photos - it still works fine) and the paint is a little worn here and there, particularly on the neck from where he placed his hand when he played (again, see the photos).\u00a0 As best as I can tell, the serial number is 03201393 (see photos - back of the headstock), which means the guitar was manufactured in the Nashville, TN plant on November 16,\u00a0 2001.\u00a0 The tiny dents in the chrome pickup cover are no big deal. That part is easily replaceable. In fact, you can just remove the covers if you don\u2019t like them. in my experience, most Les Pauls don\u2019t even have pickup covers. The case has a few dings, but is still in decent shape.\u00a0 The lock on the case will snap shut and open, but it won't \"lock\" using the combination.\u00a0 It basically functions just like the other snap locks on the case. I will probably ship the guitar USPS, UPS, or FedEx ground service unless you request otherwise.\u00a0 I am just going to ship the guitar in the case without a box around the case.\u00a0 I've bought numerous guitars offline, and this has always worked fine when I get guitars shipped to me (it is a hardshell case, after all).\u00a0 However, I'll probably put a little bubble wrap in the case to further shield the guitar from getting banged around too much in the shipping process in case the delivery man handles it rough. Shipping usually runs anywhere from $85 to $150.\u00a0 I'm just going to charge $100 and if it is more, I'll pay the rest out of the sales price. Overall, this is a good guitar with a little wear on it.\u00a0 I've had it a few years, but I don't really play it much.\u00a0 It plays well, sounds good, and works fine, but I just have other Les Pauls that I play more often.\u00a0 So, I'm letting it go.\u00a0 Happy bidding! (Note:\u00a0 I just noticed that I have my strap-locks on the guitar in the photos.\u00a0 I keep those and put the regular strap that were on it when I got it, back on it.\u00a0\u00a0 I just wanted to let potential buyers know.\u00a0 However, I might just leave those on there.\u00a0 I'll decide before I ship.\u00a0 The polishing cloth and strap stay with the guitar.)\u00a0 Note: This guitar sold in an auction a few days ago, but the buyer asked me to cancel the order because the person they were buying for had already gotten a guitar from someone else.\u00a0 So, this is a re-list.\u00a0 Happy bidding!", "ItemID": "292865380724", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T21:27:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T05:38:21.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-grey-gray-silver-pewter-/292865380724", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pineville, Louisiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928653807248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/V2oAAOSwlelb8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MTY=/z/32MAAOSwoZJb8JUa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjQ=/z/GacAAOSwTxhb8JUa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MTE=/z/zlIAAOSwVXdb8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MDY=/z/J2YAAOSwt0db8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/MkgAAOSwwqVb8JUc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-nMAAOSwnh5b8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vZQAAOSwYh5b8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODE0WDE1OTk=/z/bXgAAOSwqKNb8JUc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/M9oAAOSwarlb8JUb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Vs8AAOSwPTlb8JUc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/N0EAAOSwzhZb8JUd/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "71360", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "starbuck2907", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 80, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2208}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Studio grey gray silver pewter", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silver"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 425, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 430.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
