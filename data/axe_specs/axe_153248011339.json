{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "G&L ASAT Special Tribute Series \"Tele\"-style guitar made in Indonesia with a carved top in very good condition. Ash body, maple neck, flame top, rosewood fret board. This guitar is in very lightly used condition. There are a very few small barely-visible scratches here and there, but you won't even notice them unless you hold the guitar up to the light and search carefully for them. There are no gouges, no cracks, no buckle rash, no chips, no dings, no repairs. Nothing. As far as I know, all the components are original and no work has been done on the guitar. The guitar does not have a tummy cut nor a forearm cut. It does, however, have a carved flame top and is very comfortable to hold and play, even while standing. I'm unable to weigh it, but I'm sure you can find that online somewhere. I believe the guitar to have been produced in the 2010's, but I haven't verified that with a serial no. search. It was made in Indonesia; the build-quality seems good; no misalignments or other problems. The fret board is in basically unused condition, but could probably use some fret board oil, as the wood looks a bit dry. The frets are also in like-new condition and are filed smooth on the ends. This guitar is NOT like the cheap $200 guitars you see listed on ebay coming out of China. It's a serious, quality guitar for people on a budget who can't plunk down $1,000 on a USA-made Tele. Comes with two thunderous (but without hum or hiss) and full-sounding G&L MTD pickups, a 3-way pickup selector and volume and tone controls. Neck pick up for rock, bridge pick up for twang. Action is moderately low, intonation is fine, and the guitar plays well and sounds good. Of course \"action\" is subjective, so you might want to have it set up with your string gauge and height. The strings on there now feel like 11's. The G&L bridge is rock solid and string length and height are easily adjusted. Plug into a tube amp, dial in a little tremolo or delay, and you won't be disappointed. It has a BIG sound, especially from the neck pick up. Comes with a G&L black gig back in very good condition; strongly made with sufficient padding, two zippered pockets, and shoulder straps. Likely it came with the guitar when originally purchased. This guitar is for sale locally at a local guitar shop, so I reserve the right to end the auction early. I'd keep it if I could, but it's time to thin the herd, as people say, and put some funds aside for my daughter's college education. Shipping is a flat $90, which includes insurance. Local pick up is also possible; in fact, I prefer it. If you choose that, I'm in the Long Beach, CA area, 90815, and I'll refund the shipping fee, either thru Paypal or directly to you in cash when you pick it up. Sorry, but shipping is limited to the lower 48 states of the United States. All sales final, no returns. But you won't want to return it. Feel free to contact me with any questions and I'll try to reply ASAP.
