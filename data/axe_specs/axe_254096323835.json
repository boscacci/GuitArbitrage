Gibson style bridge and tailpiece. all hardware is good quality in black finish. double humbuckers for fat sound, new control knobs and an Epi gig bag to sleep in. this is an xlnt entry level or progressing players guitar for anyone that wants a nice instrument at an affordable price. pro set up with new strings, intonation set, and ready to rock. again, NOT JUNK. buyer adds $20 bucks towards shipping, most likely will be twice that, and i'll cover the rest, within the mainland 48 states only, elsewhere can be discussed. i will pack it well. email any ??'s, THNX for looks and bids. keep on rockin'", "ItemID": "254096323835", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T06:17:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-26T06:17:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-sg-Gothic-matte-black-2004-ready-Rock-/254096323835", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Big Bear Lake, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540963238358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/yt4AAOSwdaVcS-9d/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Q3sAAOSw8zRcS-94/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dbkAAOSwEvZcS--U/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ahgAAOSw4F9cS--t/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fy0AAOSwHDJcS-~Q/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aWAAAOSwlINcS-~k/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/koEAAOSwoEFcS~AJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QRUAAOSwKXhcS~Al/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hxMAAOSwbKVcS~BC/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/aO4AAOSw4ohcS~BS/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4zUAAOSw0LhcS~CJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Vw4AAOSw1vxcS~Ce/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "92315", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fxs50", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2766, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 184.29, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 184.29, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone sg Gothic matte black, from 2004\u00a0 ready to Rock", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2004"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SG"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Gothic"]}]}, "HitCount": 192, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 186.79, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
