Fender - 25th Anniversary Stratocaster 1979 Fender 25th Anniversary Stratocaster finished in Porsche silver. This guitar is in good overall condition for its age and has the common and expected signs of wear and use. There are plenty of honest dings, dents, finish fading, rub spots and scratches. The 25th anniversary was the first time since the early 70\u2019s that the 4 bolt neck returned to the Stratocaster. This is also the first \u201cAnniversary\u201d instrument ever produced by the company. The neck of the guitar dates 1979, has a typical chunky 70\u2019s profile. The ash body is free from any aftermarket routing and the original pickgaurd has the correct shielding. The pots appear original and date to 1979 where visible. The pickups are the original grey bottoms with stamp and original factory masking tape wrap still intact. The guitar is 90% original with only minor changes or replacements. The frets are original and as expected on a 38 year old guitar will need replacement soon. The guitar is playable as is and was not re-fretted to preserve the original integrity of the guitar. The tremolo unit is a replacement, the claw is original and does not show signs of the ground wire being re-soldered. The guitar also features the original chrome Fender stamped sealed Schaller tuners. The strap buttons were changed to Dunlop straplocks long ago. These 25th Anniversary guitars are a very cool playable addition to any collection. The COA is no longer with the guitar The Guitar also ships complete with the original hard case and tremolo bar!
