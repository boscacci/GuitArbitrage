{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This Ibanez ATK 305 bass is a beautiful sunburst-finish 2007 model in excellent condition and comes with an Ibanez hard case. The bass has a maple neck, triple-coil pickup, fully-active EQ with separate bass, middle, & treble controls, and a huge heavy duty bridge. The bass can be strung through the body or directly to the bridge - try both and see which you prefer tonally (I did both as you can see in the pic - higher strings from the back of the body, lower strings direct to the bridge - string position has a subtle but noticeable effect on the tone). There is a three-position switch for the high-end, the attack, from which the ATK gets his name - settings are boost, normal, and cut. The combination of fully active preamp and three-band bass/mid/treble EQ give this bass an infinite range of tone. There's no pickguard - I've never used them on any Ibanez basses.This was one of several ATK basses I owned during my tenure with the band HEDpe and it was used to record a few tracks on HEDpe's NWO album recorded in 2008, but I can't remember which songs.I'm no Ibanez expert but altogether I had about 22 Ibanez basses and the models from the 2000s were my favorite - in later years many Ibanez ATKs had third-party pickups installed but this model is all Ibanez and the components are top-class.
