{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is my Gibson Limited Run ES-335 Metallic Semi-Hollow Electric Guitar, in the wood rose color way. Condition is Used but it's in A to A- condition, as it has been played, but very few imperfections, zero scratches on the pick guard and nothing I could capture on a photo.\u00a0 This guitar comes with the original case as well, which does have a few scratches on the top and bottom, which you will see in the photo's.\u00a0 I purchased this guitar brand new in April of 2018 for $3,849.00 USD.\u00a0 It's one of only x50 produced in the rare wood rose color way.\u00a0 It comes with original Gibson hardshell case and all accessories/paper work that were included with the guitar when purchased new.\u00a0 I purchased this in the U.S., from an authorized Gibson dealer, and I'm selling it from the U.S. where it has always lived.\u00a0 Looks like most of these for sale on ebay right now have been gobbled up by overseas buyers and the pricing has been jacked up considerably, as these are collectors items.\u00a0 Amazing guitar, very fair price, and fast shipping. GOOD LUCK! This guitar has a bit more to it than the other listings you'll see:\u00a0\u00a0 First, I have replaced the bridge pick up with a far superior Gibson P94 ($140).\u00a0 The P94 is the most amazing pick up that Gibson makes.\u00a0 All the lows from a humbucker, the highs from single coil and the most amazing mids you've ever heard.\u00a0 Of course the original bridge pick up is included if you desire, but if you plan on playing this guitar, I would try it as is first. Second, this guitar has been re-wired with the Mojotone Premium ES-335 wiring kit ($140).\u00a0 Simply the best electronics for the best guitar in the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Third, I've replaced the stock tuners (Grover \"milk bottle\" tuners) with the Gibson Vintage Nickel Machine heads w/ Pearloid buttons ($70).\u00a0 Not an upgrade in quality, but style wise this was a must have.\u00a0 Original Grover tuners included, if you would like to revert to the stock tuners. ALL of these upgrades listed above were professionally installed by Portland Fret Works (install value $250)!!!\u00a0 Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to see any more photo's.\u00a0 Happy to assist in any way.\u00a0\u00a0 GUITAR SPECS: Body Body shape:Double cutaway Body type:Semi-hollow or chambered body Body material:Laminated Top wood:3-plyMaple/poplar/maple Body wood:3-plyMaple/poplar/maple Body finish:Gloss Orientation:Right handed Neck Neck shape:C roundedRolled edge binding Neck wood:QuartersawnMahogany Joint:Set-in Scale length:24.75 in.

Replacing a traditional humbucker pickup with the P94 requires no additional routing or other modifications to the guitar. The P94 features the same vintage, enamel-like coated wiring and Alnico V magnets that are used inside the legendary P90, delivering more sustain and output than a traditional singlecoil pickup but with deep lows, growling mids and sizzling highs. In solid body guitars, take advantage of the P94\u2019s ability to easily overdrive your amplifier, or simply \"clean up\" by backing down on the volume. In an archtop guitar, you can realize the rich, full tone of the smoothest jazz riffs. The P94R (neck) has reverse polarity for a hum-free operation when used together with the P94T (bridge). Each P94 comes with shielded, three-conductor lead wiring, and is fully wax potted to protect against unwanted microphonic feedback. Output: 9.8 Position:\u00a0Both Magnet:\u00a0Alnico V Wiring:\u00a02-Conductor Details:\u00a050\u2019s historic tone, warm and soulful in a Humbucker size MOJOTONE PREMIUM WIRING KIT: It's all about the tone.
