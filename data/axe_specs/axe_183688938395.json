{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Jackson DK2M Snow White. MADE IN JAPAN This guitar is in good used condition with some surface scratches/marks throughout from normal use. The neck pocket also has a small finish crack on one side (pictured and illustrated). I have illustrated the most significant blemishes in the pics. If they are not a problem for you, you will probably love this guitar as any others that didn't show up in the pics are less significant blemishes than the one shown and/or illustrated. The neck is in good shape. The frets are beautiful and shiny with very little wear. The headstock looks good, the tip is not chipped. The hardware has only minor signs of use but is otherwise clean. Comes complete with tremolo bar. Guitar has all of its original cover plates. It has brand new Ernie Ball 9s on it. This guitar looks and plays great and is ready to rock!
