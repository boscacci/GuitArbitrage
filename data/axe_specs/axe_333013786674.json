Check out the details below and ask any questions you want. Thank you for looking and good luck!Guitar weight- 7# 13oz Perhaps the most-heard, yet unmentioned guitarist in history is Bob Bain. With his trusty Telecaster, he created the soundtrack to American pop culture in the latter half of the 20th century, playing on sessions with legendary artists ranging from Frank Sinatra to Quincy Jones, and on TV show themes such as \u201cPeter Gunn\u201d and \u201cMission Impossible\u201d. Still gigging and swingin\u2019 at 91 years young, even after a 22-year stint in Doc Severinsen\u2019s renowned Tonight Show Band, Bain\u2019s work has influenced almost every guitarist who came along after him, whether they realize it or not. Heavily modified to meet the demands of playing every musical style imaginable, Bain\u2019s modified Telecaster was often imitated, but never recreated\u2014until now. Master Builder Paul Waller studied every detail of this amazing instrument, and reproduced it in exacting detail, as only the artisans of the Fender Custom Shop can. Like many session musicians, Bain modified his instrument in the name of flexibility and to meet his personal needs. Not content with the wealth of stock sounds available, he added a Bigsby\u00ae B-16 tremolo system and placed a humbucking pickup in the neck position. The added sonic flexibility afforded by these mods allowed Bain to stretch across genres ranging from rock to jazz to country to pop, in the process rewriting the vocabulary of modern music. Other features are stock for a guitar from that era, including the ultra-stable riftsawn maple neck with a \u201853\u201d Soft V\u201d-shaped profile, 7.25\u201d-radius fingerboard, black phenolic pickguard, vintage-style tuning machines with Fender logo, round string tree and bone nut. Includes a hardshell case, strap and Certificate of Authenticity.", "ItemID": "333013786674", "EndTime": "2019-01-20T23:23:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-13T23:23:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Custom-Shop-Masterbuilt-Bob-Bain-Son-Gunn-1953-Telecaster-Incredible-/333013786674", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3330137866748080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/~2sAAOSwC~9cMhap/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/LzkAAOSw~JFcMhMl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/hHsAAOSw7R9cMhap/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/CSMAAOSwi3xcMhap/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/lUUAAOSwIABcMhap/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/oqAAAOSwuZVcMhap/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/BNoAAOSw4otcMhap/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/va4AAOSw8U9cMhar/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/oqQAAOSwuZVcMhar/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/1eUAAOSwj5BcMhaq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "03101", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mmusicmilloutlet", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 638, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 37, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 246}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Custom Shop Masterbuilt Bob Bain Son of a Gunn 1953 Telecaster Incredible", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blonde"]}]}, "HitCount": 374, "Subtitle": "Partial or Full Trading accepted", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 4350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Like New Condition with original paperwork certificate", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "SKU": "9215000229", "NewBestOffer": false}
