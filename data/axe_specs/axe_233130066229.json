{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "PRS Custom 22 1996 Excellent Condition Paul Reed Smith Guitar. This guitar has the sought-after Dragon I pickups, and the wide-thin neck. It has obviously not been played much, it is in very good condition! The back of the guitar is nearly perfect, just a couple of tiny dings too small to photograph, no buckle rash. There are 3 small dings on the front, pretty hard to see from more than 3 feet away or so. The frets have just a tiny bit of wear in a couple of spots, very minor. Includes original hard case, which is in almost new condition. This guitar has special-order gold hardware. As you can see in the photos, the bridge has the usual tarnishing from where the hand typically rests. This has the 5-position rotary switch for the pickups. You will be hard pressed to find a 20+ year old guitar in better shape. Why pay $3000-4000 for a new one!", "ItemID": "233130066229", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T21:01:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-11T21:08:14.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-Custom-22-1996-Excellent-Condition-Paul-Reed-Smith-Guitar-Vintage-/233130066229", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Houston, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331300662298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/bioAAOSwEWNcYduT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/h9IAAOSwT9hcYdt1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Xx4AAOSwvMVcYdXY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3MwAAOSw9ClcYdXc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f2UAAOSwe0tcYdXt/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/x~cAAOSwCdtcYdYJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kJUAAOSwHSVcYdYQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9I4AAOSw5eBcYddV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BY4AAOSwQpVcYddb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Mw8AAOSwcGtcYduI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xHsAAOSw19dcYdu~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-o4AAOSwJoxcYdxM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "77057", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gtrjake", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 136, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 35}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS Custom 22 1996 Excellent Condition Paul Reed Smith Guitar Vintage", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1996"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom 22"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 363, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
