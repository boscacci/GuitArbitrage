{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "The Yamaha RGX612A was built by Yamaha in the late eighties to compete with the Ibanez, Jackson/Charvel and Kramer guitars that were so popular for rock and metal styles of the time. It was built in Taiwan and was a reasonably high-end instrument back in its day. It features an alder body, maple neck with rosewood fretboard, 24 jumbo frets, Yamaha RM (Rockin' Magic) Pro tremolo bridge (kind of like a cross between a Floyd Rose and a Kahler). This particular model features an H-S-S pickup configuration with Yamaha active pickups/electronics. There is a master volume control, two tone controls, an on/off switch for each pickup, and a master boost switch, which adds more bite to the sound for thicker tones. This was very well cared for and belonged to a boy who was in a band back in the 80's, that boy is now an older man and does not have a use for this beautiful instrument. There is no return on this item. I apologize but international shipping is not available for this item.", "ItemID": "283254640377", "EndTime": "2018-12-30T21:25:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-11T03:54:02.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980s-Yamaha-RGX612a-Vintage-Yamaha-rgx-electric-guitar-hard-case-/283254640377", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Rancho Palos Verdes, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832546403778080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/MjYAAOSwPeVb56WY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/K6AAAOSwBYZb56Wc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/nfMAAOSwySZb56Wi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/ZxYAAOSwpYxb56Wp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/eF8AAOSwDEBb56Wu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/Kt8AAOSwFLFb56Wy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/CY0AAOSwOsFb56W2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/uzwAAOSwWIJb56W7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/sT8AAOSwmUBb56XB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/GR4AAOSwWV1b56XG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/Z0YAAOSwpYxb56XJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMVgxNjAw/z/rvEAAOSwXKtb56XN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90275", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "tragikeyes", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 464, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 94.1}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***u", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 7}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980's Yamaha RGX612a Vintage Yamaha rgx electric guitar with hard case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Yamaha"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Vintage"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1980"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["black hard case and strap"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 1193, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1107065297", "StoreName": "Mias Closet Treasures"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Great condition, black electric guitar with strap and hard case.
