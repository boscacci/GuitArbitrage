{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Ibanez S470 in Jewel Blue, made in Japan in 1993. Structurally this guitar is in sound shape. Pickups, electronics and frets are all in excellent shape. It plays nice and the tremolo edge is nice and sharp. It flutters nicely.As with many older Ibanez guitars, the finish has some dings and scratches. There is a section with some wood damage. I've tried to capture this in the photos. The neck has a few scratches on the back which looks like it may have fallen over on a cymbal stand or something. Check the photos. The Jewel Blue finish has always been one of my favorites, but because of the condition, I was going to refinish it. I never got around to it.
