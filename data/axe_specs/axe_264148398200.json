{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2010 GIBSON Les Paul Studio Goldtop - 50s Tribute. VG condition. Made in USA. Worn satin nitro finish. Original Gibson P90s. Hardware is flawless and includes locking TonePros stopbar tailpiece. The maple top is in good shape with no dings. There are some light wear and scratches on back and sides with one ding on the side of headstock. Features a chambered mahogany body and what looks like a quartersawn mahogany neck (50s rounded profile). For comparison, I would describe the neck as a medium C. The frets are in good shape and the action is set up low (.060\" 12th fret). Plays smoothly in all positions with no buzzing. New set of 09-42 strings. SN: 120400xxx Overall, the guitar has a vintage look to it and the tone on this guitar is absolutely to die for! Even unplugged, the guitar exhibits a sonority and acoustic quality reminiscent of a well made classical guitar. I am a custom guitar builder, buying, selling and trading guitars. This guitar is set up and ready to play. There are no issues. I will include a generic gig bag for shipping. Payment by Paypal due within 3 days of purchasing items. I will only accept a return if guitar is significantly not as described and depicted in the pictures. No exceptions or buyer remorse! I will ship via Fedex Home Delivery to lower 48 States.
