Players have such varied opinions that I no longer want to hear about it. Here is a very cool Squier \"Custom Shack Tele\" with some nice upgrades. The maple 21 fret neck has near zero fret wear and has had a nice headstock makeover with many coats of clear over the decal. The very cool Gloss Surf Green body has only the mildest surface scratches and features a string thru the body modern style six saddle fixed bridge. The pickups are some nice alnico 5's. I also upgraded the capacitor with a .033uf axial film capacitor. All electronics work perfectly,and sound great on every setting,clean or with some distortion. No joke these pickups sound killer on this guitar. Action is good and could probably lowered even more. Guitar plays,looks,and sounds great.
