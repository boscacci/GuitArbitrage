{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A sweet guitar in near mint condition. Originally purchased from Elderly Instruments in 2000 and handled with care for 18 years. I recently had the electronics tuned, the action and intonation set perfectly by the experts at the Guitar Parlor in Riegelsville, PA. Lightly played during its long history, this guitar needs someone who will take it out of the case and make it sing way more (and maybe with less care) than I have. Includes OHSC and original leather Rickenbacker strap. Here's what Sweetwater says about this model: A Pedigreed Rocker with Deluxe AppointmentsThe Rickenbacker 360 is the deluxe version of the 330. In addition to the 330's jangly maple tones and classic good vibes, the 360 gives you rounded horns, a contoured top edge that rolls into back binding, and iconic triangle (\"shark fin\") fingerboard inlays. Though most of these updates are cosmetic, one of the coolest upgrades to the 360 is the Rick-O-Sound stereo output. This sends each of the Hi-gain pickups to its own amplifier, or straight into a recording medium for instant stereo guitars. The Rickenbacker was loved by artists like George Harrison and Roger McGuinn for its shimmering chord voicings, and Sweetwater is sure contemporary players will enjoy its top-class tones as well.All-maple construction provides a bright foundation Everything but the Rickenbacker 360's fingerboard is made from high-grade maple. Maple's density is partly responsible for the 360's famous sustain and top-end jangle and shimmer. Maple is also very stable, aiding in maintaining the structural integrity of the neck. The thick rosewood fingerboard adds a touch of warmth and harmonic richness to this otherwise bright instrument. Dot inlays give it the traditional 360 look.Hi-gain pickups and 5-knob layout allow for a wide range of tonesThe heart and soul of all Rickenbackers are the proprietary electronics. In the 360 electric guitar you'll find a pair of Hi-gain single-coils. These pickups deliver the stringiness of many other single-coils, but with an aggressive cut that has driven so many rhythm and lead guitar tracks through the decades. A 5-knob control layout with \"blend\" knob gives you a wide range of sounds to play with.Stereo Rick-O-Sound output opens up a palette of sonic possibilitiesRickenbacker spec'd the 360 with two output jacks. The first is a standard mono output. The second is a stereo Rick-O-Sound output, which outputs both pickups as a separate signal. Just think about the possibilities! You can feed your 360's neck pickup into a clean American tweed for bass definition, then out your bridge pickup to an overdriven British stack for raucous tube grit. This option is also great for studio performers. By sending one signal to two sources, you can get an instant stereo track with only one performance.Rickenbacker 360 Semi-hollowbody Electric Guitar Features:Iconic guitar enjoyed by George Harrison, Peter Buck, and Roger McGuinnDeluxe upgrade to the 330Semi-acoustic maple body with cat's eye soundhole is lightweight and balancedContoured horns and rounded body edges roll into back binding", "ItemID": "173715448966", "EndTime": "2019-01-05T17:25:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T01:19:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2000-Rickenbacker-360-MapleGlo-6-String-Rick-O-Sound-OHSC-Superb-Condition-/173715448966", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Stockton, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1737154489668080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/l0oAAOSwfsdcKWdp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ORMAAOSwcH5cKWdr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ckwAAOSwZbVcKWdr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/mOoAAOSwHEZcKWds/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/vy4AAOSwPYRcKWdr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/paIAAOSws2RcKWdq/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ZagAAOSwtFxcKWdp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/wVUAAOSwj5BcKWdp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ADgAAOSwo1lcKWdp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/w3EAAOSwjQVcKWdp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4T8AAOSwXI1cKWdr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/8-kAAOSwdgxcKWdp/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "08559", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jandeproductions", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 16, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1315.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 2}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2000 Rickenbacker 360 MapleGlo 6 String - Rick-O-Sound - OHSC - Superb Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Rickenbacker"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["360"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Clear"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Rick-o-sound"]}]}, "HitCount": 210, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1340.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
