{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "It's your turn to treat yourself!!!! Nice example of what Carvin of Southern California is turning out. The CT (Carved Top) was developed to put a smack down on PRS. You custom order to your specs. This one has a Floyd, locking nut, locking tuners and backbox stabilizer so it stays in tune! Also has an oiled neck -feels amazing and plays very fast. The top is 4-A Maple which is what PRS would designate as a 10-top and slap on a 3K price tag!!!. Long tenor set-neck for amazing sustain! The guitar plays, looks and sounds great. Frets and board were just cleaned and conditioned. Some fret ware is visible but tons of life left. The gold hardware has some aging too and the body has some impressions/ dimples here and there but nothing at hinders you for playing/enjoying this guitar for years to come. If you ever wanted a PRS with a slimmer neck profile, this is your guitar! Comes with Carvin case too. To Sum up, She's a beast -super well balanced, very resonant when unplugged with uncanny sustain - like getting the best best of Les paul and PRS in one! Time to make this one yours. I look forward to hearing from you soon! God bless and thank you for looking", "ItemID": "192755631905", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T04:28:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-12T04:28:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Carvin-CT6-California-Carved-Top-AAAA-Floyd-Rose-NO-RESERVE-/192755631905", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Eden Prairie, Minnesota", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "VisaMC"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927556319058080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/uGsAAOSwXWhcEI10/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTUxMlgxNjAw/z/o0EAAOSwxoJcEI16/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNTM2/z/UrkAAOSwSidcEI2D/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NDI=/z/DAoAAOSwhhlcEI2H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/wZ8AAOSwKOZcEI2P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzY0/z/C7kAAOSwSONcEI2W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2OFgxNjAw/z/F7MAAOSwVCpcEI2a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY4/z/ncAAAOSwHAxcEI2f/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NjU=/z/fpIAAOSwKphcEI2k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MzM=/z/-vwAAOSwRF1cEI2n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "55346", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "316guitars", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 462, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1209.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1209.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 57}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Carvin CT6 -California Carved Top AAAA Floyd Rose NO RESERVE!", "HitCount": 465, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1234.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "See description", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
