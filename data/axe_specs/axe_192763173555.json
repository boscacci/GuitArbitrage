{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "WHAT A GREAT 20 YEAR OLD GUITAR!! HOT-RODDED PICKUPS! This is a Fender Standard Telecaster Electric Guitar. This tele was made in Mexico, MIM. Serial Number Mn81533xx, makes it a 1998 model. The guitar is 100% complete, and an EXCEPTIONAL PLAYER. There are some light marks and dings. The body has been (purposely?) lightly sanded for a satin finish. This has the look of what other famous makers (Gibson, Epiphone) call a 'faded' or 'worn' finish. Maybe an attempt to begin the 'RELIC' look or maybe done to cut down on stage light glare. It has a nice flame maple neck that looks better in person than in picture. It is in perfect structural condition. An exceptionally solid guitar for a 20 year old. PROFESSIONALLY SET UP AND SERVICED, IT PLAYS GREAT!! Features include: Chrome hardware, Fender sealed tuners, 21 fret maple neck w/ dot markers, custom AlNiCo magnet neck pickup, Seymour Duncan Hot Stack bridge pickup, 3 way pickup switch, master volume control, master tone control, three ply black pick guard, three tone sunburst body. The set up on this guitar is awesome, nice and low. The truss rod works as it should, neck is straight. All the electronics work as they should (no scratchy pots). Chrome parts have some light corrosion and scratches. Frets and finger board are in good shape. I have completely serviced the guitar... cleaned the body and neck, cleaned the fingerboard, dressed/leveled/polished the frets, installed new strings (Fender pure nickle 10-46's), tweaked the neck truss rod, adjusted the bridge and intonation, etc. I spend as much time and what ever it takes to make guitars play and perform as good as they possibly can. I can honestly say this guitar plays better than most new ones. DON'T MISS IT!! Includes the genuine Fender gigbag case you see in the pictures. Buyer pays $34.95 shipping, insurance, PACKAGING and HANDLING to the contiguous 48 states. Items over 2 lbs will ship Fed Ex ground, (no PO Boxes).
