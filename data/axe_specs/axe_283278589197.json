{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Gorgeous pre-owned 1st-run 2007 Gibson Les Paul Robot Blue Silverburst. Comes complete with charger and case candy. Original Gibson hard-case also included. **Sellers Note** The lock on the hard case is missing, however, the other simple latches all work fine and does not hinder a tight & safe close-up. GUITAR INFO The Gibson Robot Guitar (a.k.a. GOR) is a limited-edition self-tuning Gibson guitar, typically a Les Paul.[1][2] The first run of limited edition Robot Guitars was exclusively made up of Les Paul bodies.[3] Five different Gibson models were available (2008-2011, Robot X-plorer 2008-2012)) with Robot Guitar features: The Robot Les Paul Studio,[4] Robot SG,[5] Robot Flying V, Robot X-plorer, and a Robot Les Paul Junior. Developed by Chris Adams, its most notable feature is that it uses an onboard computer to automatically tune itself. This is not the first guitar to be able to tune itself,[6] but it is regarded as the most modern, unique, and non-invasive self-tuning model available, because it does not employ cams or cantilevers throughout the body of the guitar.[7] The non-limited edition SG and Les Paul Studio are available in a variety of finishes. The Flying V and Explorer are only available in metallic red. In the case of the \"Original 1st Production\" Robot guitar the only finish available was Blue Silverburst nitrocellulose, a color which Gibson has stated will never be used on any other Gibson guitar (see photo to the right). The original Robot guitar also featured headstock and neck binding which are not standard on any current Les Paul Robot as well as a chrome truss rod cover with \"Robot Guitar\" engraved. The production version featured 22-fret rosewood-bound (standard finishes) or white-bound (metallic finishes) ebony fingerboard with figured acrylic tapezoid inlays, white-bound headstock with MOP Gibson logo and flowerpot inlay (metallic finishes) or unbound headstock with screened logo (standard finishes), three-per-side robotic Powerhead Locking tuners, tune-o-matic Powertune bridge, Powertune stop tailpiece, two chrome covered humbucker pickups (490R, 498T), four knobs (three normal, and one Master Control Knob that controls the robotic actions of the guitar), three-way pickup switch, Neutrik jack on side of guitar, chrome hardware.", "ItemID": "283278589197", "EndTime": "2018-12-03T19:54:42.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-26T19:54:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Robot-Limited-Edition-1st-Production-Run-2007-Blue-Silverburst-/283278589197", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Chicago, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832785891978080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tawAAOSwBgZb9vvm/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SM8AAOSwF1tb9vwB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODQ3WDE0OTI=/z/vE8AAOSwUP5b9vwU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OMUAAOSwWH1b9vwk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YCAAAOSwd7Fb9vwt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk3WDE1MjE=/z/OUkAAOSwa~Fb9vxE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "60618", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nickfarina09", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 275, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 21, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.07, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1000.07, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "c***i", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 108}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Robot Limited Edition 1st Production Run 2007 Blue Silverburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}]}, "HitCount": 333, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1025.07, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
