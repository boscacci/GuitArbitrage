Epiphone Les Paul Model Standard Right Hand Electric Guitar Sunburst Condition: This guitar is in great cosmetic condition. The Epiphone Les Paul Standard PlusTop Pro sets a new standard for guitars in its price range. Two Epiphone ProBucker humbucking pickups with coil-splitting deliver big slabs of the fat, warm tones, transcontinental sustain, and deep, soulful distortion that made this guitar famous. Crafted with a solid mahogany body and flamed maple carved top, a set mahogany neck, 22-fret rosewood fingerboard, cream body and fingerboard binding, and chrome hardware. The Tune-o-matic bridge and LockTone stopbar tailpiece add seemingly unending sustain and make string changes easier. Please see photos for more details.
