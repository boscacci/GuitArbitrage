{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello eBay Friends! For sale today we have a 1990'S era RARE Fender Japanese Ritchie Blackmore Stratocaster Electric Guitar plus FREE SHIPPING! Olympic White with the Serial Number: V030194 I was the only owner of this guitar and it is ready for the stage or studio. This guitar has the Graduated Scalloped Rosewood Fretboard for faster playing. Comes with the classic Tweed Hard Shell Case! Please note two things about this Guitar: #1: This guitar came with the strap lock system built into the body (see pictures) . I don't have the other half of this strap lock system but getting a new one at your local guitar shop is not that big of deal. #2: I changed the pick ups for this guitar with Seymour Duncan's so the middle pickup is not a \"dummy\" pickup like it was in the original release of this guitar, all 3 pickups work and YES it's a 5-Way pickup position switch :-) Buy with confidence, I have a 100% PERFECT eBay selling score!
