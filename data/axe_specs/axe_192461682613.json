Gibson\u2019s launch of the Limited Edition Robot Guitar redefined the power and possibility of a guitar to capture the imagination of players all around the world. Gibson is now proud to answer the demands of thousands who wanted another chance at owning the ground-breaking technology with the introduction of the Robot Les Paul Studio, which combines with power and performance of Gibson\u2019s iconic Les Paul model with the revolutionary Robot Tuning System.This model is no longer \"Robot\".The Les Paul Studio has been a popular choice of hard-working guitarists everywhere ever since its introduction in 1983. Now, Gibson USA brings increased sonic versatility and performance upgrades to a new Les Paul Studio. The Les Paul Studio blends timeless tonewoods and components with improved comfort, powerful humbucking pickups and the classic looks that define it as a genuine Gibson Les Paul. All this, and the Les Paul Studio looks stunning in Metallic Purple high-gloss nitrocellulose lacquer. DIMARZIO EVOLUTION\u00ae BRIDGE HUMBUCKER (DP159)The Evolution\u00ae Neck and Bridge humbuckers are the result of two years of research to come up with the right sound for a very demanding player: Steve Vai and his Ibanez\u00ae Jems. Both pickups are designed for maximum impact and power. The neck pickup is fat, punchy and loud. The bridge pickup is tight, aggressive and louder. Both pickups have our patented dual-resonance configuration to reproduce more harmonic overtones than conventional humbuckers. Evolution\u00ae pickups are not polite-sounding, and they\u2019re not for the inexperienced, but \u2013 if you\u2019ve got the chops and a hot amp \u2013 your sound will burn. The Evolution\u00ae pickups were originally designed with live gigs in mind, but they have so much presence and definition that they\u2019re great recording pickups, too; they slice right through even the densest mix. DIMARZIO PAF PRO\u00ae NECK HUMBUCKER (DP151)The PAF Pro\u00ae was created when chops-intensive playing was first starting to happen, and high-gain amps and rack systems were becoming popular. A pickup was needed that combined a lot of presence and \u201ccut\u201d with an open-sounding PAF\u00ae vibe. The transparency of its sound lets the PAF Pro\u00ae slice through heavy processing, where darker-sounding pickups get lost in the mud of the effects chain. Low notes have both snap and chunk, and there is a spike in the mid-range that gives the pickup a subtle \u201caw\u201d vowel sound, like a wah-wah pedal stopped in the middle. Treble response is tweaked to produce highs that stand out without getting brittle. The PAF Pro\u00ae makes an outstanding neck pickup in almost any guitar, and it\u2019s an exceptional bridge pickup when high output isn\u2019t required.
