{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Beautiful, excellent condition, all-original 1977 Les Paul Deluxe. This guitar has not been altered in any way, no routing, no repairs, no headstock breaks, everything works perfectly.The Original hard shell case is included.For a vintage instrument of this age, you will not find one in better shape. There is a tiny flake of the clear coat off the back of the neck near the top, it is about 1/5 the size of dime (see the photo of back of neck) and did not dent or impress into the wood. I am the second owner, and this guitar has been played very little in the 41 years since it was made, basically a closet queen, as I mainly play country music on telecasters. Some things that make 1977 models highly desirable compared to other 1970s years: This was the year they reverted from the multi-piece \"pancake\" bodies made from thinner mahogany glued/sandwiched together and went back to a single slab. This was the first year they went back to stamped serial numbers on the headstocks, having used cheap decals in the years preceding. This era was prior to the \"swiss cheese\" drilling of the bodies that started in about '81. The Goldtop Deluxe was THE ultimate iconic Norlin era Les Paul, and this is the best example I've seen.
