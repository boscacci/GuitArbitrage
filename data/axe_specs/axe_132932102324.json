{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ok, got a single humbucker partscaster Strat here that was a guinea pig for some design things. It's got a metallic fuschia textured glitter pickguard with matching headstock. Also has a matching vinyl pinstripe around the outside. You will likely have to pat down the tape as the weather changes...if that sort of stuff bothers you, then NOT a guitar for you. This started out as a used guitar, so there are scratches and wear marks on it. Nice shape, but not perfect. It plays fine, the neck is great, and it is nicely set up. A REAL guitar, and a playable one. It's NOT a Fender, but it's a unique guitar with a little bit of custom work. That's about it...it is what it is, and if you're looking for a $100 beater, this is a cool one. Please note, it is MISSING the whammy bar.", "ItemID": "132932102324", "EndTime": "2019-02-04T01:15:00.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-28T01:15:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Partscaster-Strat-style-Electric-Guitar-Stratocaster-/132932102324", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Huntington, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329321023248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DEQAAOSw2qpcTeRH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hKsAAOSwPNhcTeQe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/oVsAAOSwt0dcTeQk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WKYAAOSwC~9cTeQp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sVUAAOSwQfRcTeQv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XdwAAOSw64xcTeQ1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wl4AAOSwNqxcTeQ7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mMEAAOSwKwhcTeRB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~ZwAAOSwtINcTeP9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11743", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mystereman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3159, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 99.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 120}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Partscaster Strat style  Electric Guitar - Stratocaster", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 142, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
