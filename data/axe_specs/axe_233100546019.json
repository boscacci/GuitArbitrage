{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 2016 Gibson Flying V in Excellent condition. Comes equipped with a 57\u2019 Classic pickup in the neck position and a Burstbucker 3 pickup in the bridge position. Has one Master Tone and two Volume controls, one for each pickup. Both Volume controls are Push/Pull capable for coil splitting each pickup individually. Also equipped with a 3-way pickup selector. Comes with a padded Gibson Gigbag and a Gibson Lightning Bolt strap. One note: the back of the headstock has the words \u201cMade in the USA 2016\u201d stamped very lightly. It\u2019s kind of difficult to see. (thanks Gibson QC) When I bought the guitar, I just decided to keep it. So anyway, BUYER BEWARE. Also the headstock tuners on the Treble side are each missing a small screw. They are held in by one screw each instead of two. (Again Thanks Gibson QC) So again BUYER BEWARE. Now, I\u2019ve had this guitar since 2016. I\u2019m the original owner and I have had no problems with it whatsoever. It\u2019s a great guitar! I\u2019m reluctantly selling because I need the money for other purposes. If you really want to rock out, buy this guitar!", "ItemID": "233100546019", "EndTime": "2019-02-17T16:56:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-19T03:01:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Flying-V-2016-/233100546019", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Warrington, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331005460198080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D4kAAOSwnKFcQo8O/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IyoAAOSwcf9cQo8T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vtgAAOSwuwlcQo8Q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zJAAAOSwip5cQo8R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/QdsAAOSwOShcQo8V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wfYAAOSwAP9cQo8U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2aMAAOSw1IhcQo8X/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/coEAAOSwsrlcQo8a/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2agAAOSw1IhcQo8f/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bm0AAOSwg1JcQo8Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/j4cAAOSw11BcQo8g/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "18976", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "flint991", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 114, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 900.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 210}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Flying V 2016", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2016"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Flying V"]}]}, "HitCount": 846, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
