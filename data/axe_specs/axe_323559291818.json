{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "PRS SE Standard 24 Cherry Electric Guitar - Great Condition This guitar is used but looks beautiful, plays well, and is in very nice condition all around. All the electronics work. It sets up well, good action, no string buzz. It has been used very little, so there is no wear on the fret board. A very close inspection shows only a couple of minor blemishes. There are a couple of light scratches that you really have to search for to find, and there is a tiny ding on the tip of the head stock (see last picture). I bought this used a few months ago, but am partial to Fender. I wanted to try a humbucker guitar, so I bought this one. I just prefer Fender and have used this very little, so am selling it. This auction includes the guitar as pictured, tremolo bar, hex key for adjusting the bridge saddles, truss rod wrench, and an extra plain black truss rod nut cover. I never used the tremolo. I put in a block of wood to hold the bridge stable. I will leave the block there in case you want to keep it, or you can remove it. It just slips in or out. This guitar features dual humbucker pickups, tone knob, volume knob, 3-way switch to select bridge pickup, neck pickup, or both pickups. It also has split coil technology. Just pull the tone knob out to convert the pickups to single coil. Note: I do not have the original box. It will be packed well, and shipped in one of my Fender Boxes FYI.", "ItemID": "323559291818", "EndTime": "2018-11-25T22:43:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-20T22:43:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-SE-Standard-24-Cherry-Electric-Guitar-Great-Condition-/323559291818", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pahrump, Nevada", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235592918188080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gJ0AAOSw5qdb8vx2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/EsUAAOSwvYRb8vx6/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k5cAAOSwZ4Rb8vx9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k5wAAOSwZ4Rb8vyB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/leMAAOSwIw1b8vyE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k6AAAOSw1cdb8vyH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WT0AAOSwkitb8vyK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CHUAAOSwezRb8vyO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/DSAAAOSwlkpb8vyR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zzcAAOSwfQ9b8vyV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oNIAAOSwatBb8vyY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "89048", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "lvnv147", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 277, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 38, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 304.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 304.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 85}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS SE Standard 24 Cherry Electric Guitar - Great Condition", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["SE Standard 24"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["SE Standard 24"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["SE Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 722, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 309.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Beautiful look, Plays well, no issues.
