{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "UP FOR AUCTION I HAVE THIS VINTAGE GUITAR THAT I BOUGHT AT AN AUCTION. I REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GUITARS, I TRIED TO RESEARCH THIS BUT KEPT COMING UP WITH WEIRD VARIANCES, SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS OR WHAT YEAR. THIS IS A KRAMER HST 300, I THINK IT'S A SOLID BODY AS IT'S SUPER HEAVY, 10 POUNDS. IT HAS 4 PICKUPS AND A FLOYD ROSE II TREMOLO SYSTEM. THERE ARE 2 TONE BUTTONS, A VOLUME BUTTON, A TOGGLE SWITCH THAT STOPS IN 3 POSITIONS AND A LEVER BUTTON THAT STOPS IN 4 POSITIONS. THIS IS 38.5\" X 2\" IF YOU ADD THE PICK GUARD, I BELIEVE THE NECK AND THE HEADSTOCK ARE MAPLE, THE TUNERS ARE MARKED: KRAMER. THE METAL BACK PLATE READS: KRAMER, SE 4137, NEPTUNE, NJ USA. MY HUSBAND AND I TRIED THIS WITH AN AMP AND IT DOES WORK, THE BAR THING ALSO WORKS (MAY BE A BIT LOOSE), THE ONLY THING WAS THE VOLUME BUTTON HAS A BIT OF STATIC WHEN YOU TOUCH IT, BUT WHEN RELEASED SOUNDS FINE. OVERALL I BELIEVE THIS IS IN GOOD CONDITION, IT HAS A FEW SCRATCHES AND NICKS HERE AND THERE AND A FEW SMALL CRACKS IN THE FINISH ON THE BACK. THE STRAP IS A DOCTOR SONG AND IS IN USED CONDITION. IT WILL NEED NEW STRINGS, IF I'VE LEFT ANYTHING OUT PLEASE CONTACT ME AND I WILL TRY TO HELP. I AM GOING TO CHARGE $60.00 FOR SHIPPING, IF IT DOESN'T END UP COSTING THAT AMOUNT, I WILL REFUND THE OVERAGE.
