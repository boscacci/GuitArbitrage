{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is my Gretsch G5236T Pro Jet with Bigsby tremolo. Like every other player, I have too many guitars and it's time for this one to sell. I have a couple $100 in upgrades into this guitar and I'm never going to get it back - so this is a deal for you! I replaced the factory bridge and tuners to help it stay in tune better with the Bigsby. The bridge has rolling saddles so the strings don't catch and the tuners are locking Sperzels. Also has strap locks. Pickups are the factory ones. Everything was setup by a pro guitar tech. There is some paint chipping around one of the strap locks (see picture) but aside from that there is no cosmetic damage - no scratches, dings or buckle rash (check the pics). Hard shell case included. Guitar has a rosewood fretboard, 22 frets, chambered mahogany body. Even though it's made in China it's a decent quality guitar. I used it for gigging with no issues. I'm not 100% sure on the year - I purchased it around 2009 so it's earlier than that - maybe early 2000's? I'll ship this out Fedex ground $30 unless you want something else.", "ItemID": "173694883035", "EndTime": "2018-12-24T00:02:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-17T00:02:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gretsch-Pro-Jet-G5236T-Bigsby-new-bridge-Sperzel-locking-tuners-/173694883035", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fairport, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1736948830358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/wzcAAOSwkvtb-yD7/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yVsAAOSwaalb-yFT/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WpcAAOSwN3Nb-yEI/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TtIAAOSwE9pb-yFH/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lnIAAOSwCK1b-yE4/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mPYAAOSwKphb-yDt/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/nwQAAOSwsPNb-yEt/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XtkAAOSwUPVb-yET/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BrQAAOSwORxb-yEg/$_57.PNG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "14450", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jemodz", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 193, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 89}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gretsch Pro Jet G5236T with Bigsby, new bridge, Sperzel locking tuners", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gretsch"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silver"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Pro Jet"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 136, "Subtitle": "Gretsch Pro Jet with upgraded bridge and tuners", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 355.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
