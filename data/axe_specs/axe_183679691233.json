Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have prior to any bid, offer, or purchase! \u2028 Why MIJ and MIK Guitars? \u2028 If you are gratified by finding cool, uncommon things that are no longer made, this is for you. \u2028 Discriminating guitar players began seeking out vintage Made in Japan (\u201cMIJ\u201d) and Made in Korea (\u201cMIK\u201d) solid body guitars after discovering the tremendous value and quality of these instruments. Many of these gems rival their much more expensive American-made counterparts, and are certainly better than comparable price-point instruments available at retail today. Sometimes it is the difference between buying a computer-controlled, machine made guitars that are all exactly alike versus a hand- made instrument or one created in small lots.Also,with diminishing supplies of over-harvested, high-quality tone woods,vintage MIJ and MIK guitars present the opportunity to buy guitars made from woods generally only available now in custom shop or high-end instruments. Two areas in which MIJ and MIK guitars might fall short of the mark,though, are tuning machines and electronics. Although they do not affect the basic function and playability of the instrument,those areas appear to be the components where cost-cutting took place.However, with an abundance of excellent and affordable after-market parts, it is easy to change out these components,usually as a DIY project. Although \u201cupgrading\u201d is purely optional, it presents an opportunity to select components that might better suit your needs or to put your unique spin on the guitar. \u2028 Another cool aspect of vintage MIJ and MIK solid bodies is that they are often \u201ccloset classic\u201d instruments that have been safely stored under a bed or in a closet for decades. They can be time capsules,often with the original strings intact. \u2028 On the other end of the spectrum are the \u201cpre-distressed\u201d MIJ and MIK guitars that have collected the bumps, bruises, and finish wear that only a genuinely well-played or well-travelled guitar can accumulate over the course of years. Why pay for a new guitar with phony \u201cdistressing\u201d when you can buy the genuine article, often for much less. Simply stated, MIJ an MIK guitars rock.
