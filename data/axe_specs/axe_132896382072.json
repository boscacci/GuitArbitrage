{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2004 McCarty made in USA. \u00a0Mahagony neck and body with marbled maple top. \u00a0Factory locking tuners (upgrade). Excellent player's guitar. \u00a0Set up perfectly and plays like butter. Frets are very good. Intonates well. Stays in tune very well. \u00a0 Stock PRS McCarty Pickups. It is\u00a0wired to have a split coil in both the bridge and neck positions which gives you a ton of tonal options. \u00a0The split coil sounds a little more like a single coil and the full on humbucker is just what you'd expect. \u00a0The guitar has numerous dings and scratches but nothing that effects the playability. \u00a0It also has some clear coat flaking off next to the fret board that is shown in the pictures. \u00a0It has been \"loved\" over the years. \u00a0I bought a PRS 594 and this guitar is too similar to justify keeping both. \u00a0 This guitar is much better quality than anything Gibson has made in the last several decades, short of their custom shop models, and at a much better price. \u00a0Weighs just under 7lbs. \u00a0Comes with original hard shell case that also has some scratches and dings. \u00a0This is a good quality American built guitar and a fantastic value for the price.
