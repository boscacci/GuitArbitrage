{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1993 Gibson Nighthawk Standard ST-3. Condition is Used. Very nice. Finish wear on back of neck not a big deal and note noticable to touch... See pictures. Rest of body nicy shape. Frets are good. Pots fine and all switching works. Very nice guitar. Case not original but guitar fits well in it. On Feb-15-19 at 20:14:23 PST, seller added the following information: Frets in good condition. Truss rod works. I adjusted it to set action low with no issues. Email me for pictures of frets or whatever you want to see closer.On Feb-24-19 at 05:38:31 PST, seller added the following information: Some additional notes :I see no neck or headstock repairs. I'm not an expert but I've been playing guitar 25 years and do my own setups, etc. The truss rod worked fine the one time I adjusted it. Turned very easily. When I got the guitar I lowered the action to my preference. No issues and was done in 5 minutes. The neck has the discoloration on the back that I mention (see pict). From what I can tell it is just finish wear. It is smooth there though and it looks like it has some finish over that spot. So someone may have laid some clear coat or nitrous on the back of the neck at some point. If they did it was sanded out and you don't notice it at all while playing. It plays well and very clean for 25 year old guitar. The case appears to be an aftermarket Gibson SG case. Made in Canada. Decent quality The guitar fits pretty well in it though it is not original.", "ItemID": "192826322571", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T01:58:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T01:58:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1993-Gibson-Nighthawk-Standard-ST-3-/192826322571", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Fairfax Station, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1928263225718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/lyUAAOSwWbZcZhlM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/agIAAOSwsExcZhmb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/JAgAAOSw8KRcZhme/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Y8kAAOSwpOVcZhmf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/5nkAAOSwqCJcZhmg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/2EwAAOSwiLZcZhmh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ie4AAOSwP9dcZhmj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/RFcAAOSwEWNcZhml/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/vakAAOSwFeNcZhmn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/J9gAAOSw2QxcZhmo/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/q5oAAOSw~6hcZhmp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/PMIAAOSw~TdcZhmr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "22039", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "c_com", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 493, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 20, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 710.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "u***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 18}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1993 Gibson Nighthawk Standard ST-3", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1993"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Standard"]}]}, "HitCount": 857, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 720.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
