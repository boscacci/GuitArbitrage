{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Relisted due to non paying bidder... Welcome to our auction! NO RESERVE! You are bidding on a NICE Gibson Custom Shop ES339 in antique vintage sunburst finish. Gibson complete model number is ES3399AVSNH1. Serial number is CS743XX. Checklist is dated 10/18/2007. The guitar has a couple of issues. The truss rod appears to be broken (nut turns freely but does not have resistance). Consequently the screw holes for the truss rod cover are stripped out due to someone taking it off and replacing it to inspect the truss rod I suppose. Keep those 2 issues in mind when bidding. Replacing a truss rod is not cheap. Cosmetically the guitar is in good shape. There are buckle marks from a strap on the back and there are various light scratches in the finish. The headstock has a few scrapes/nicks in it but nothing major. Please review all pictures to determine your idea of condition (some folks think scratches are normal wear; others simply cannot believe there is a single scratch anywhere on a guitar body). Guitar/case comes from a smoking home so if you have a super sensitive sniffer this one might not be for you. Great guitar that you can play in the studio or on the road without worry of dinging it up a bit. Electronics work as they should and sound great. Tone/volume knobs are free from scratchiness. There is NO RESERVE on this guitar; high bidder wins. Please ask any and all questions (or request pics) before bidding. This is a great opportunity to buy this guitar, spend a little money fixing it, and have a fantastic Custom Shop Gibson to play and enjoy. Comes with everything pictured including Custom Shop certificate and original checklist. FREE Shipping will either be USPS Priority Mail or FedEx ground (lower 48 states and no PO BOXES please) depending on final destination and weight of package. There is no \"buy it now\" price. Payment is due within 3 days of auction end.", "ItemID": "153290663876", "EndTime": "2018-12-10T01:30:09.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T01:30:09.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/NICE-Gibson-ES-339-Custom-Shop-Electric-Guitar-OHSC-READ-FREE-SHIPPING-/153290663876", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Martinsburg, West Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1532906638768080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HgMAAOSwaSVb~WrA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vlwAAOSwl5Jb~WrC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/E8kAAOSwCK1b~WrD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uA0AAOSwfplb~WrG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nUoAAOSwrQxb~WrM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mtMAAOSwydZb~WrO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vnYAAOSwl5Jb~WrR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iS4AAOSwgVJb~WrT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/a8AAAOSwRrlb~WrW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/y-MAAOSwWz5b~WrY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rMYAAOSwrQ5b~Wra/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/W7kAAOSw6CRb~Wre/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "25404", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "paradisepawnwvmartinsburg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2850, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 54, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 996.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 996.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 28}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "NICE!
