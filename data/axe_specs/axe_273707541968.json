{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "GROTE HEADLESS GUITARNECK THROUGHASH BODYMAPLE NECKROSEWOOD FRETBOARDADDED COIL SPLIT MINI SWITCHMILD COSMETIC BLEMISHES This is one of the early Grote headless neck throughs from 2017. It's not in absolute mint condition, but it's still a fun low costneck through headless guitar. I added a mini coil split switch so you can get a wider variety of sounds. Middle position on the mini switch is full humbucker. Up position splits the neck, down position splits the bridge. There is a little finish flaw around the mini toggle switch. Very minor. There is also a standard 2 way pickup selector switch Side of fretboard has some clear coat scuffing when I smoothed down some sharp fret edges. Please see pics. Frets are in fairly good shape. Much better when guitar first arrived from the factory. Action is good medium low. I found that light 9-42 strings in standard E tuning work best on this model bridge. Bridge is somewhat unusual, but I have it set up fairly well at the moment. I still haven't mastered quite how to adjust it. I believe it's better to adjust the little saddle height allen screws when there's not much string tension. It has a nice little winder wrench that has a magnetic holderon the side of the bridge, Again, this is not a $3,500 high end guitar. For what it is, however, it's still cool. Pickup alignment is not quite dead center, but everything still sounds good. These are just the little things that the chinese sellers don't mention, haha. All electronics are working. Guitar is in better playing condition than when these ship from the factory. A little mild buzz here and there, but still very playable as is. Factory set up was horrible. There is some scuffing the black headpiece nut, but it's still in very good shape. Neck is a full wide C shape. It's a good meaty neck. It's not an Ibanez thin Wizard style for sure. This guitar is good as is for a fun player, or maybe it will be a perfect project guitar for someone that wants to take it all apart and re-do everything.The wood build quality is actually very nice. I was going to strip it and refinish it in a red stain, but never got around to it. I've basically taken $100 off the current ebay price on this one. Comes with trussrod and bridge allen wrenches.Bridge also has a little magnetic string winder wrench. It will be in the same little bag as other wrenches when guitar ships. Comes with a very cheap homemade gig bag. It's not pretty, but it's good for basic storage. If you have any questions, please answer before purchase! I'll be happy to answer them all. I ship fast via USPS Priority Mail with tracking number. Thanks for looking!
