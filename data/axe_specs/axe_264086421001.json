{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A true Road dog. Played hard and used a lot. There have been quite a few changes on this guitar. I believe this guitar to be made in 1970, although according to the serial numbers, it could be as late as a '76. However, 1970 was the last year of this model. After 1970, they produced a es-355 TD variphase. This one does not have the variphase knob. There is a coil tapping switch where it would be. I don't believe it was a replacement because the hole where the coil tap is, would not be big enough for the variphase switch. The machine heads have been changed. The vibrato tailpiece has been changed to a stop tailpiece and has left two little holes where the vibrato would have been, the dates on the volume and tone pot codes are 1978 so I believe they were changed around that time. Perhaps that is also when the master volume knob was added in the upper right-hand bout. Or perhaps it was all done in the factory by special order. One might jump to the conclusion that this guitar was a 1978, but Gibson started the 8-digit serialization in 1977, and this guitar has a 6 digit serial number. This guitar has been well used and that can be shown on the back of the neck, the original red finish is almost completely gone and it looks like perhaps somebody took a black marker at the base of the neck and colored that in. It might not even be the original neck, there is no way to know. The output on the bridge pickup is 8.11. the output on the neck pickup is 7.93. The guitar plays great, all the volume and tone knobs and switches work just as they should, and all of the latches on the original case function. If you are a Keith Richards fan, this is the guitar for you.", "ItemID": "264086421001", "EndTime": "2018-12-20T19:37:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T11:51:49.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1970-Gibson-ES-355TD-Original-Hard-Shell-Case-/264086421001", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Marietta, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640864210018080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzMlgxNTg0/z/uNAAAOSwizRbmq~i/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rq8AAOSwiXVbmq9P/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BV0AAOSwG9Zbmq9Z/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OpQAAOSwnOlbmq93/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyN1gxNTg0/z/iwoAAOSwB8Zbmq~2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tSMAAOSwmVdbmq-O/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2MzE=/z/7G0AAOSwq2JbmrAO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg4Mjc=/z/GUgAAOSw8WdbmrAe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE1WDQ2MQ==/z/Hj4AAOSwh49bmq~J/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE1WDQ2MQ==/z/tb4AAOSwmVdbmq~K/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE1WDQ2MQ==/z/6WsAAOSwMtpbmq~L/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjE1WDQ2MQ==/z/WlgAAOSwinlbmq~N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "30064", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dougsmusicnstuff", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2380, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 4999.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 4999.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 513}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1970 Gibson ES-355TD With Original Hard Shell Case ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-355"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 122, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1104462520", "StoreName": "westcobbmusicandpawn"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
