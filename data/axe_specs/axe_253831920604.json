{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is Your Chance To Get A Piece Of History! This is a Gibson ES 355 Lucille Custom made to BB King's specifications. You can find quite a few Epiphone guitars signed but there are VERY few of the actual Gibson ES 355 Lucille guitars with signatures certified by JSA. This guitar has been used very little if any. I believe the owner probably bought this guitar with the intention of trying to get it signed so there seems to be no play on the guitar. I am very interested in talking about trades for other ES and L model Gibsons. This guitar is from 1997 and was made in the Gibson Memphis plant. It comes with the tan gibson case. There are others out there with price tags up to $25,000. This is a collectors dream and will do nothing but go up in value over time. Make this part of your collection! I Am Open To Trades! I have added enough to the shipping cost to fully insure this guitar", "ItemID": "253831920604", "EndTime": "2018-12-21T13:21:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-08-25T19:01:00.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/CHRISTMAS-Sale-Autographed-B-B-King-Gibson-ES-355-Lucille-/253831920604", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Land O' Lakes, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2538319206048080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY3/z/bhMAAOSwqMpbgaOD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY3/z/ViUAAOSwnntbgaOX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/mFQAAOSwsspbgaOi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/FxAAAOSwyUtbgaOu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU5OVgxMDY3/z/K0cAAOSwc39bgaPB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY3/z/rBsAAOSwF91bgaQJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY3/z/CBkAAOSwQmhbgaPJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY3/z/RnoAAOSwhE9bgaPi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/K4AAAOSwGUhbgaPu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/HvsAAOSwuTxbgaQA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFgxNjAw/z/u9AAAOSw1BtbgaQR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/vCMAAOSw1BtbgaQl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34639", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "schell_shocked", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 179, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 9995.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 9995.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 0}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "CHRISTMAS Sale!
