{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Telecaster Copy with Fender Padded Gig Bag & Humbucker - NO RESERVE I took this one and another guitar in trade for one of my other guitars. Previous owner modified the headstock and added an aftermarket headstock decal. May have started out as a Squier, but I can't say for sure. Whatever is was, it was a quality guitar with thru-the-body stringing and clean, powerful pickups. The body is flawless and beautiful. The action is low with no buzzing. Features six individual bridge saddles for perfect intonation. If you would like to turn this into something like Keith Richards' Tele, I've included a chrome humbucker for you to install--or not. Either way, no complaining about a free humbucker just because it has a small dent in the cover. Pickup itself works perfectly. The padded Fender gig bag is in excellent condition with the exception of the front pocket zipper pull. Part of it is missing, but it still zips fine. No returns. NO RESERVE. Shipping to the lower 48 states ONLY. PayPal only and payment is due within 24 hours of auction ending.", "ItemID": "312480108314", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T21:27:21.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-16T21:27:21.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Telecaster-Copy-Fender-Padded-Gig-Bag-Humbucker-NO-RESERVE-/312480108314", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cleveland, Wisconsin", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3124801083148080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzAwWDExMDc=/z/sewAAOSwpYpcaH61/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njk5WDEwMjQ=/z/9AcAAOSwaEZcaH66/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzAwWDYwMA==/z/UmUAAOSwnDRcaH68/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY0WDcwMA==/z/usgAAOSws3dcaH7B/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "53015", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bernico", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2172, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 139.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 139.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Telecaster Copy with Fender Padded Gig Bag & Humbucker - NO RESERVE", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cream"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Tele style"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2019"]}]}, "HitCount": 203, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 142.49, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "If not for the customizing on the headstock, this guitar could have been listed as New, Other.
