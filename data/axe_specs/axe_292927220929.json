{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Jackson RR Concorde JS32-CD - Snow white with Gold Hardware These models are much more in line with Randy's original white prototype concorde due to the bigger body and wider \"wingspan\" than the typical RR models, Neck is also inset in to the body like Randy's first concorde. I bought this used several months ago and only played it a few times, In same condition as when I recieved it. Guitar has minor cosmetic flaws as pictured - slight discoloration of back of wing tip, small chips on horn tips (easy touch up fix), cosmetic spot on neck past 24th fret (another easy touch up fix) and a spot on volume knob. Other than that it looks and sounds great. When purchased it did not come with a whammy bar - I have added an aftermarket bar in matching gold finish, not a perfect plush fit but it gets the job done just fine.
