{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "In good condition 1965 Holiday Guitar and Amp. There are flaws to each piece read below for details. The guitar has scratching in the paint from use. There is light rust on the bottom part of the guitar by the strings. There are newer strings on the guitar. The volume and tone knobs all work well and as they should. The bridge is off center and will need readjusted. This guitar appears to have been worked on. There is a little bit of cracking where the screws go on the white plate to the guitar. The case is in overall good condition. There is normal wear from age. The clips to close the case all work as they should. The Amp is in good condition for its age. The strap to carry the amp is busted. The Amp works well and fires up right away. The volume knob cracks when the volume is being adjusted. There is no other damage to this piece that I notice. ***If Purchased the App and the guitar will be shipped separately to keep them both safe. **** Thank you for viewing. I do combine shipping and handling. Feel free to check out my other items. Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.", "ItemID": "153384969151", "EndTime": "2019-02-23T21:57:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T23:42:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-HOLIDAY-SOLID-BODY-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-ORIGINAL-CASE-AND-AMP-/153384969151", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Urbana, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533849691518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kRYAAOSw8yxca0K0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg5MjU=/z/M6cAAOSweTlca0Kk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jIQAAOSwOlxca0Jw/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PrEAAOSwSk5ca0Jx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg4MzU=/z/yPkAAOSwXCVca0Ka/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3cUAAOSw1xZca0KR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KrAAAOSwGEJca0KT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gRQAAOSwOztca0Ke/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YZsAAOSwUR9ca0Kp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vXkAAOSwxS9ca0Kt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2z0AAOSwGjtca0Kx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hpEAAOSwtLxca0K4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "43078", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stashlee1989", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 267, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 95.9}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 311}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "VINTAGE HOLIDAY SOLID BODY ELECTRIC GUITAR WITH ORIGINAL CASE AND AMP", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Holiday"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["HOLIDAY"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Multicolor"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 37, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1141008247", "StoreName": "Stash&#39;s Deals"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 304.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
