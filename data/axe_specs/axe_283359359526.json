{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 1985 Fender Contemporary Stratocaster in a very rare color, very rare guitar, Metallic KO. The history behind this series of Stratocaster is really interesting.These extremely well made Fender Contemporary models were the first Fender Japan models to be named Fender Stratocasters. All previous Fender Japan models were Fender Squier models. The Fender Contemporary models were manufactured from 1984 to 1987 by FujiGen Gakki and these Stratocasters were designed to be Superstrats with a Floyd Rose like bridge designed by Schaller and Gotoh and humbucking pickups. The Fender Contemporary Stratocaster was part of the Fender Japan E series model range.When CBS sold Fender to its current owners in 1984 there was a transitional period from 1984 to 1987 with limited Fender USA production resulting in mostly Fender Japan and leftover stock being sold. These Strats rival the quality of American made Strats and are prized for their workmanship, playability and excellent tone. This one is the E-series Model 27-4400 with a solid body, 1 humbucking pickup, 1 volume, System I Tremolo, rosewood fingerboard, 25.5\" scale length and side mounted output jack. I have never seen another of these in all of my 40 + years of playing. I do not ship out of the United States or to Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico and will send via FedEx ground with signature required for delivery.", "ItemID": "283359359526", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T18:00:55.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T21:51:51.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Contemporary-1985-Stratocaster-MIJ-Metallic-KO-27-4400-/283359359526", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Canonsburg, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833593595268080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/odsAAOSwmvpcKl8C/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/gJsAAOSwMKxcKl93/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DScAAOSwa3FcKl8k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/mMEAAOSwEVlcKl~h/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/cbkAAOSwR0dcKmAL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/7YoAAOSwikBcKmAt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/0OsAAOSwhEhcKmBG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/StMAAOSwjkZcKmKT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/KaAAAOSw~llcKmLi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/m2AAAOSwNXtcKmRw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/KhgAAOSwmfhcKmSN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "15317", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ronbest1963", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 146, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 359}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Contemporary 1985 Stratocaster MIJ Metallic KO 27-4400", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1985"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["KO 27-4400"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Metallic"]}]}, "HitCount": 115, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 4, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This 1985 Fender Contemporary Stratocaster E-series KO 27-4400 was purchased in 1985, played a hand full of times and then stored until this year. It has minimal signs of use and is in very good condition. There are a few blemishes as seen in the pics, two small indents and a chip on the head stock and a small scratch on the front. Over all in great condition and plays like you want a Strat to play. Floyd Rose like bridge designed by Schaller works well and Gotoh and humbucking pickup screams. Guitar is 100% original. The only thing missing is the allen wrench for the locking nut.
