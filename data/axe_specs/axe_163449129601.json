{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Original Vintage 1977 Fender Telecaster Deluxe LEFT HANDED with original case. This guitar is in excellent condition! Great Tone with original Seth Lover Fender Humbucker Pick-ups. Glossy finish a few dings. Finish checking on headstock but, great shape especially when you consider that it is 41 years old. Made of swamp ash from the Mississippi Delta. I hate to part with this, my favorite guitar but, It is a bit heavy for my 64 year old neck. I now need a lighter weight guitar. What a drag it is getting old. The frets have much life left in them. Great guitar for rock, blues as well as country. Absolutely no noise. Item is sold as is but, I am sure whoever owns this axe will love it upon first sight. There are absolutely no issues with this guitar either structural or electronic and it has great low action, stays in tune forever, and is a very pretty gal. The original Fender case is not the greatest but, it will protect the guitar and that is what counts isn't it? Thanks for looking and have a Merry Christmas. No Paypal bank transfers only. Shipping for actual cost plus insurance for the seller! Will ship in one day.", "ItemID": "163449129601", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T01:23:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-24T16:18:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1977-Fender-American-Vintage-Telecaster-Deluxe-Left-Handed-OHSC-Excellent-Cond-/163449129601", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Modesto, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634491296018080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/q7wAAOSw-4JcF8GX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/rO0AAOSwUMBcF8Ew/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/ER8AAOSwj91cF8gF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/x0YAAOSwvcFcF8GY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/jjQAAOSwVMJcF8GZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/l9YAAOSwR0dcF8GZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/Xc4AAOSwBPRcF8GY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/~EgAAOSwx1FcF8Ga/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/neQAAOSwkFZcF8Ga/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/f7gAAOSw5UFcF8GZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/rvcAAOSw5cZcF8GZ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/vgAAAOSwwZxcF8Ga/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "95350", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "musicfix54", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 319, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2885.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2885.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "6***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 31}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1977 Fender American Vintage Telecaster Deluxe Left Handed\u00a0 OHSC Excellent Cond!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["72 Telecaster Deluxe"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Left-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blonde"]}]}, "HitCount": 144, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2935.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
