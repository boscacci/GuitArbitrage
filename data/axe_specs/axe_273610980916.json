{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a mint condition 2010 Gibson Explorer, a reissue based on the famous '76 model. It was made in the USA, where it was the 460th instrument stamped on February 2nd in the year of its manufacturing. You're looking at the iconic offset-hourglass frame, composed in body and neck of mahogany, with a black finish and a white pickguard. Other features include a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard with pearl dot inlay, tune-o-matic bridge/stop tailpiece, blackface peghead with pearl logo inlay, six-on-a-side tuners, chrome hardware, two ceramic (496R and 500T) magnet humbucker pickups, two volume/one tone controls, and a three-position switch. I had security strap locks installed by an expert shortly after the original purchase to prevent accidents when playing in the standing position. A custom Gibson hard case is included in the price. Shipping is free. Whether you're plugging into a practice amp or shredding through a powerful stack, the sound is remarkable and the neck is smooth to navigate. I bought it eagerly in the year it was made, but have not taken it out of the case much since then. My hope is that it will find good use for an enthusiastic musician who appreciates a fine instrument and takes good care of his or her belongings.", "ItemID": "273610980916", "EndTime": "2018-12-19T20:15:30.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-14T20:15:30.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Explorer-2010-Black-White-76-Reissue-/273610980916", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Naperville, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736109809168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LUoAAOSwG49cFAkR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dw4AAOSwkelcFAkE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gccAAOSwVXdcFAj7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OZsAAOSwiT1cFAkc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TSYAAOSwPYRcFAj3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3vgAAOSwFs1cFAj-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gnQAAOSwX4VcFAkH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hEEAAOSwHu5cFAkL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5OVgxNTk5/z/~IwAAOSwlkpcFAkO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7VMAAOSwMflcFAkV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IaUAAOSwZtRcFAkZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WwYAAOSwa~FcFAkB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "60565", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thebrevettedscribe", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 76, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 18, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 352}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ReserveMet": true, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": " Gibson Explorer 2010 Black/White '76 Reissue", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Explorer"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2010"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Offset Hourglass"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["I had a hardware expert install a security strap lock to prevent accidents when playing in a standing position."]}]}, "HitCount": 346, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 810.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 0, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar was purchased new in 2010 and remains in mint condition as it was rarely used or taken out of its case.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "SKU": "MINT condition", "NewBestOffer": false}
