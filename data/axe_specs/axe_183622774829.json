{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I purchased this guitar on January 2017 as a surprise present for a friend of mine who wanted to get into guitar. Incidentally they went out and bought the same exact guitar after I recommended this one around the same time so I just kept this one for myself. I already have a large collection of other guitars that I play 99% of the time. Occasionally I may pick this one up but I have an actual Gibson Les Paul to pick up as well so this one doesn't get played that often. It's mostly been in a hard case under my bed for the last year. That said, I think this is a great guitar for the money. It won't break the bank but it offers the sound quality of much more expensive guitars. It looks, feels, and sounds like a true Les Paul. It's a great guitar for someone who is progressing in skill or transitioning into electric guitar from acoustic. It's also a great option for someone looking for a relatively cheap electric guitar that can take a beating from regular practice, gigs, travel, etc. but still sounds amazing. The quality of the guitar is pristine. It has barely been played since I purchased it. There have been no falls or water exposure. The only small defects are three very small scratches on the sides of the guitar body, which I've taken a picture of attached. This was caused by my living room table next to my sofa. I sometimes bump my guitars on it when I put them down. They're barely noticeable. The actual face, back, and neck of the guitar remain as new. The guitar has been stored in a hard case under my bed when not in use. I'm the only one who has played it and I've used it only at home. The guitar will come with a black gig bag to protect it during shipping and for storing or carrying it around with you. This is how it sounds like on a 15W Fender Blues Jr. amp with some slight overdrive and clean tones: https://vimeo.com/309678957. It's worth noting that Les Pauls offer a good range of control over your tone by just working with the dials on the guitar as I do in the video.", "ItemID": "183622774829", "EndTime": "2019-01-06T06:24:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T01:42:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-Epiphone-Les-Paul-100-Electric-Guitar-Heritage-Cherry-Sunburst-and-Gig-Bag-/183622774829", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Bellevue, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836227748298080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xwYAAOSwgVJcMU0x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/D9kAAOSwvwRcMU0x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2LsAAOSwV0VcMU0x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~kEAAOSw55FcMU0x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/k90AAOSwmPlcMU0x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yGIAAOSw28dcMU0y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/BGIAAOSwztVcMU0x/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gDMAAOSw5qdcMU0y/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/yNkAAOSwIsdcMU0z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0gIAAOSwb15cMU~8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VqIAAOSwQZVcMVAA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98004", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ar6208", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 16, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 9}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "DO", "PA", "TT", "GT", "SV", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Used Epiphone Les Paul 100 Electric Guitar Heritage Cherry Sunburst and Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2017"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul 100"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 52, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
