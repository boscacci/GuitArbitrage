{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "CAREFULLY READ ITEM DESCRIPTION AND THE TERMS OF SALE. Thanks!ITEM DESCRIPTION:Up for auction is one very clean Paul Reed Smith Custom 24 w/Birds and original case. This PRS CU24 is in good condition, is a 20th Anniversary build, and shows light signs of previous handling and use. It has one ding as pictured and the 5-way selector know and volume knobs have been switched. Apparently a previous owner found this setup better (and I tend to agree). It is a joy to play and is a great ax for anybody seeking to score a PRS CU24 at a reasonable price. Strap pegs changed out to strap lock posts. The ax ships with its original case. Unit will be boxed up tight to insure safe transit during shipping. Thanks for stopping by!TERMS BIDDING AND SHIPPING ARE TO CONFIRMED EBAY MEMBERS ONLY.WE SHIP ALL OVER THE WORLD.
