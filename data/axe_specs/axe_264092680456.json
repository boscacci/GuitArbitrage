{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a signature Jim Adkins (Of Jimmy Eat World) Fender thinline Telecaster. It\u2019s a Korean made guitar, which I\u2019ve heard are the better ones. It\u2019s the beautiful transparent red color that Jim often uses. If you\u2019re looking to buy this guitar, you probably know a little about it. Someone before me changed out the pickups, they put an STK P1 Seymour Duncan pickup in the neck and an SH 11 Seymour Duncan in the bridge. The guitar sounds great, all the switches and controls work. I\u2019m selling it because I\u2019m more of an acoustic player and I rarely use this guitar anymore. If you want the original SP-90\u2019s that came in it, I will have them listed as well. If you have any questions, let me know! As a side note, I\u2019m not desperate to sell this guitar, so don\u2019t insult me with a $400.00 offer.
