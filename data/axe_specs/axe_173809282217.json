{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster SSH 2008-2009 Olympic Pearl color 9.5\" radius (prior to the compound radius models) LSR Nut Locking tuners rosewood fretboard SSH pickups with s-1 push button-gives humbucker sound contoured heel Modern \"C\" shape neck New hardshell case included noiseless pickups Detailed description: This guitar is in excellent condition, and plays perfectly. Everything on the guitar is stock; there have been no mods. The LSR roller nut is featured on some of the Deluxe Stratocasters as well as the Jeff Beck Stratocasters. So this is a Fender factory installed LSR nut; not a modification to the guitar. This guitar also features the contoured heel to make playing in the high register easier. The tuning machines are deluxe staggered and locking. So there is no string tree on the headstock. The tuning posts are gradually lower as the strings get higher so there is no need for a string tree. The absence of the string tree and the addition of the roller nut allow for better tuning stability for trem users. The tremolo arm is the pop in style, and the trem bar is also included. This guitar has the s-1 switch which gives you the pickups wired in series when the push button is pressed. This gives you the humbucker sound/output which is really cool. When the button is not pushed you get the standard 5 way switch of a strat. The neck is 1 11/16\" at the nut. The neck thickness is .837\" at the 1st fret and .890\" at the 12th fret and this is a \"C\" shape neck. The neck is straight and the truss rod function perfectly. The frets are in great condition. There is some fret wear on the first 3 frets. After the first 3 frets there is little or no wear on the rest of the frets. The string action at the 17th fret is about 1.7mm on the bass strings and 1.5mm on the treble strings. This is pretty close to the Fender suggested setup for string height. The bridge has all 5 springs holding it flat, but of course this can be adjusted to your liking. There are some dings on the guitar, but they are very minor. The neck is very clean and smooth. The back of the body is also very clean with no buckle rash. There is one dent that goes through the finish, and I've pictured it. It's about 3/16\" and on the bottom horn of the strat. There are a couple other small dings on the bottom edge of the guitar, but they are very minor and not breaking the finish. Despite the few blemishes, the playability is wonderful. Any questions please feel free to ask away, and I'll do my best to answer ASAP. This guitar plays wonderfully and sounds great with many great sound variations. Happy bidding. Shipping will include insurance in the amount of the sale price.
