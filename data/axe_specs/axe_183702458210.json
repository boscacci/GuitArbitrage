{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This auction is for a 1980's Fender Squire Stratocaster. If you're looking this action you probably already know the history of these guitars. Made in Japan at the Fuji-gen Gaki plant, these guitars are among the best playing strats made IMO. I've had this one for many years but must sell it. It comes with a case and dimarzio lock strap. The guitar is very good overall condition. The action is good. Tuners all work. Selector works in all positions. Body finish is also good condition. Notable dings are a small ding on the front near the bridge (pictured) and a larger ding through the finish on the left side of the guitar (pictured) Case is in poor condition and is missing hinges. It works well for shipping though. I ship quickly and want a happy buyer so ask questions if you have them. I prefer not to ship outside the US unless its a DPO address. Note: several of the pictures make the finish look pixellated. It is smooth black.
