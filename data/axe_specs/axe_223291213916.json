{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is a bit of a rarity, it's the ec401b baritone 6, with a 27 inch scale and a mahogany body this guitar sounds beautiful and brutal, it can handle some serious downtuning, right now it's in drop A with ernie ball cobalt 7 string set minus the high E(i will include the 2 extra sets) it has aftermarket keystone tuning pegs for more of a les paul look, and currently has an emg 66 in brushed black chrome finish in the neck, i was just experimenting with clean tones, i still have the original emg 60 that was in it, which i will include, they are extremely easy to change as they are solderless and simply plug in. This guitar is super clean aside from typical belt rash on the back and a little ding on the back of the headstock that is pictured. I only used it for some studio work a couple years ago and have hardly played it since, i just need seven strings now for my current project and need to sell this one to get another 7 string. It really is a beuaty and hate to let it go, but it's not getting any use here. I will ship it in the original ESP box it came to me in, have to keep my hardshell, sorry, but will be double boxed and secured with love.", "ItemID": "223291213916", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T01:31:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-19T20:45:15.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Esp-Ltd-Ec-401B-baritone-6-string-EXCELLENT-condition-mods-/223291213916", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Morgan, Colorado", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232912139168080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5H0AAOSw6jJcGqkv/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tDcAAOSw1uVcGqlO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SwQAAOSwyUFcGqlQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/G1sAAOSwgcdcGqlT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y7IAAOSwM6FcGqlV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DKkAAOSwoEFcGqlX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-ycAAOSwnjZcGqlZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mOwAAOSwAx9cGqlb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R7UAAOSwTbxcGqo5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "80701", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "pariahak", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 122, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 590.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 590.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 67}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Esp Ltd Ec-401B baritone 6 string EXCELLENT condition with mods", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Baritone"]}]}, "HitCount": 258, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
