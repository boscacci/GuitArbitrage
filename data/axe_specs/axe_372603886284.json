{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Brand from Blade Runner, not Tokai. Blade runner had these especially made with their telecaster bladerunner system. This is new new though I am selling as used. I received it as part of an endorsement deal but I am just not into telecasters. I am astray guy. The guitar is a Tokai telecaster, 22 fret, c profile neck, Compensated bridge saddles, 2 piece body, just a really great guitar. I can see why people feel the tokay's are better than Fenders in some respects. It was ordered by Super Ver with the Super Vee Telecaster tremelo system to showcase their new product. I have been playing Super lee's for 8 years and think they are the finest and wanted to try this out but after a week its cool, it works and stays in tune, but its weird, I am just not into a tree on a tele. Maybe a b bender but when I grab a tele I play it differently than when I grab a strat and I am not into the crossover. My loss is your gain. These retail for well over 1100. Comes with Tokai Gig bag and feel free to ask any questions.", "ItemID": "372603886284", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T00:40:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-18T00:40:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Tokai-Telecaster-Breezeysound-w-SUPER-VEE-Blade-Runner-Tremelo-Bridge-Brand-new-/372603886284", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Marshfield, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3726038862848080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wHsAAOSwwPtcYD5P/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f7wAAOSwN3lcYD5R/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/tKgAAOSwroJcYD5U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODIwWDE1ODc=/z/hCgAAOSweTFcYD6v/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dbwAAOSwZ65cYD6T/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LLMAAOSwqhtcYD6J/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dlMAAOSwYNRcYD6A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IAgAAOSwAqlcYD54/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wHsAAOSw6GhcYD5y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ObQAAOSwZVpcYD5n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "02050", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "1ring2findthmall", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 328, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 16, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 466.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 466.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 13}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Tokai Telecaster Breezeysound w SUPER VEE Blade Runner Tremelo Bridge Brand new", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Tokai"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}, {"Name": "UPC", "Value": ["Does not apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 276, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 471.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
