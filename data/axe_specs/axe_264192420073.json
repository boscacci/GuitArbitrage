{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "First year for the CE22, I believe. My tech thinks it\u2019s an original prototype! The guitar is in very good condition. It has a beautiful flamed maple sunburst top and cherry burst finish! There are some small nicks, but they\u2019re very hard to see and don\u2019t affect playing or sound (See pics). This guitar has been well cared for, plays like butter and the original pickups have the sound that made PRS famous. I had it professionally refretted a few months ago, plays easily with a low, professional setup. Plus, ITS GORGEOUS! Wherever it goes, folks just want to get a closer look at it! I don't think you'll find a better CE-22 for the price! *** Just added pics of the frets and neck. The frets are smooth all the way up the neck, it's a great refret from the only guy I'll let touch my guitars. Like I said, it plays like butter!", "ItemID": "264192420073", "EndTime": "2019-02-28T02:00:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-12T00:51:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1994-PRS-CE22-Flamed-Maple-Top-Birds-Tremolo-Arm-and-Original-PUs-/264192420073", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2641924200738080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-fcAAOSw5tNcPK5c/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5BkAAOSw9g1cPK5d/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/F0QAAOSw8iZcPK5f/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hEgAAOSwhexcPK5h/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/66UAAOSwjW9cPK5n/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sT4AAOSwyPFcPK5j/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2pUAAOSwckVcPK5m/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7dcAAOSw1YRcZX1L/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3DQAAOSwW0tcZX1N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/V5QAAOSwpclcZX1P/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XXkAAOSwMnZcZX1Q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "89134", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "peaches34205", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 210, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 638}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1994 PRS CE22 With Flamed Maple Top, Birds, Tremolo Arm, and Original PU's!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["PRS"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1994"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["CE-22"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Cherry Sunburst"]}]}, "HitCount": 209, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
