{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This guitar is in excellent shape as it has only been used in my home. There are a few marks on the backside from being played. There are no scratches or blemishes on the front. The original case, case candy, and Certificate of Authenticity are included. Please examine the pictures closely and let me know if you would like to see additional pictures. Part of the current \"VOS\" series, this R8 Les Paul has a gorgeous washed cherry nitro lacquer sunburst finish (the most vibrant cherry sunburst currently offered by Gibson on this model, and also the most faithful to a mint example), and sports a textbook maple \"plain top\" with prominent grain, and a classic, understated appearance. Articulate, resonant, and capable of delivering a balanced acoustic voice, this R8 is a great example of Gibson Custom Shop quality and weighs in at 9lbs 7oz. Demonstrative of what quality tonewoods are capable of (and that select cuts of mahogany and maple can be light, resonant, and un-chambered), there are few things finer than the rich warmth of mahogany paired with a carved maple top that adds cut and attack. No-feedback buyers or buyers with negative feedback must contact me prior to bidding. Will ship to 48 states only. Guitar will be shipped with insurance added and will require signature upon delivery.", "ItemID": "233151697757", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T21:55:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-03-01T21:13:22.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2007-Gibson-Les-Paul-1958-Reissue-LPR-8-/233151697757", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Spring, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331516977578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/jFwAAOSwqaNccv5U/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/8f4AAOSwyUpccv5W/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/qFIAAOSwwZJccv5X/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/cdgAAOSw78xccv5Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/qOMAAOSwyVBccv5Z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/9JIAAOSwVR5ccv5a/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/C68AAOSwPYdccv5c/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/M-QAAOSwEP9ccv5d/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDEwMjQ=/z/rq8AAOSw2vJccv5e/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/naMAAOSwaRBccv5g/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/w7IAAOSwBlRccv5h/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "77389", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gvaughn0463", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 69, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2385.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2385.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 83}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2007 Gibson Les Paul 1958 Reissue LPR-8", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul 1958 Plain Top VOS"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1958"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["burst"]}]}, "HitCount": 12, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2410.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 5, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar is in great condition, plays perfectly, and all hardware is in mint working condition.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
