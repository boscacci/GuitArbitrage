{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Stratocaster Yngwie Malmsteen / 60th Anniv. Blizzard Pearl / EMGs Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE I am working hard to skinny down my instrument and parts collection to only the pieces I need for playing/recording, so I will be listing more musical equipment & accessories often. If you are only purchasing one item, please pay within three days of the auction ending. I would like to keep things pleasant and avoid reporting anyone as a non-payer. *** If you plan on bidding on or win more than one auction, consider waiting to pay and sending me a message detailing your bidding plans. Once all of the auctions you are interested in are over, I can combine everything on one invoice for you so you will have a lower shipping cost if I can ship all of the items together. Large items like guitars will each be shipped in separate boxes.*** Bidders with less than 10 transactions will have their bids cancelled. I have repeatedly seen people open an account, bid and win an item, and then disappear and never pay for what they have won, which is not fair to the honest bidders. I will ship guitars to you for $50.00 in addition to the purchase price. It has been costing me between $50 and $65 to ship guitars (including the Ebay/paypay fee), so I charge you the minimum. If it costs me more to ship to you, I just eat the extra cost to keep it simple. This item is sold in AS IS condition. It is a used guitar and will likely have small dents, scratches, and pick marks. I have attempted to document the physical condition in the photographs and show all items that are included, so please check them carefully. If a gig bag or case is not shown in guitar photos or mentioned in the listing, it is not included, but all items will be carefully bubble wrapped, buried in packing peanuts, and packaged carefully. It may take me up to 3 days to get your item packed and submitted to USPS or UPS. All shipping is to Ebay/Paypal USA 48 states registered addresses only. I will happily answer any questions you may have.ALL SALES ARE FINAL. NO RETURNS, so please be sure you want each item.", "ItemID": "143138242894", "EndTime": "2019-02-22T23:08:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-19T01:21:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-Yngwie-Malmsteen-60th-Anniv-Blizzard-Pearl-EMGs-/143138242894", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Brunswick, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431382428948080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Yx8AAOSwH1pb8yrN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/LNEAAOSwdwVb8yrT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/nRgAAOSwsDZb8yrh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/NAEAAOSwaPpb8yr8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/aWoAAOSwa1Zb8ysF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BicAAOSwBZBb8ysR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/n9gAAOSwEKxb8ysZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4fkAAOSwaIpb8ysg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/eOgAAOSwa1Zb8zM8/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/gh0AAOSwydZb8yqv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DTEAAOSwB9Fb8yq3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/FccAAOSwe~lb8yrC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "44212", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "capitolistking", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 832, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 535.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 535.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "x***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 230}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster Yngwie Malmsteen / 60th Anniv.
