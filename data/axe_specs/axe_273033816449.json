{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is an Original 1963 Harmony H-75 Hollow Body Electric Guitar with the Original Case. If you have ever wanted one of these 3 pickup archtops, don't miss out on this vintage beauty. These Harmony\u2019s have risen to the top of the \"collectables\" with their retro look and sound, and are considered to be the finest that Harmony ever built. The sound of these DeArmonds are incredible! Each pickup has its own unique tone, any combination of 2 pickups have a totally different tones, and all 3 sound fabulous! All switches, pickups, and controls are working properly with no buzzing or static, and has a very clean & crisp sound. The action is nice from one end of the fretboard to the other. The adjustable neck is very straight, and the frets and fretboard are in excellent shape showing no visible wear. The body, neck, and binding are solid, featuring a maple top and back, tortoise shell pick guard with the matching headstock and truss rod cover. There\u2019s some minor checking in the finish, along with a few scuffs that you would expect to see on a guitar that is 55 years old. I have tried to show as much as I could in the photos, please use the magnifier to view them in detail. This is vintage, and with all vintage guitars, the new owner will probably want to make adjustments and have it set up to meet their own needs and style of playing. Shipping is UPS or Fed-Ex, but we sometimes will ship Priority Mail for faster delivery depending on its destination.
