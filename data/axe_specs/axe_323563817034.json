{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a 1966 Fender Mustang s/n 195908- This guitar is as close to MINT condition as you will find and looks as if it just came off the showroom floor. It plays like a dream and I challenge you to find another 50+ year old guitar in this immaculate condition. This is a true museum piece. The numbers on the neck all match 100% and was verified at Guitar Center / Tacoma, Washington. (ref: pictures) NOTE: When Guitar Center put the strings back on, they did this incorrectly so please do not FLAME me.NOTE: This guitar was appraised online with an auction house in Dallas.This guitar is VINTAGE WHITE with the original tremolo bar and ORIGINAL documentation. ZERO buckle rash on the back. NO wear on the neck. Other listed Mustangs of the same year are in terrible condition.The guitar case is 98% pristine with just a couple of VERY slight dings. It is the original VICTORIA LUGGAGE COMPANY case from 1965. While I cannot say this is a one of a kind guitar, as you can see it is very close. I am offering the guitar for sale and I know what I have.I will attempt to hand deliver the guitar if close enough to the Pacific Northwest. ( Seattle / Tacoma / Portland ) I WILL NOT SHIP OVERSEAS DUE TO SCAMS.", "ItemID": "323563817034", "EndTime": "2018-11-29T17:57:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-22T17:57:25.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/66-Fender-MUSTANG-MINT-CONDITION-/323563817034", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Graham, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235638170348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/GAwAAOSwQZVb7a53/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY3/z/Ik8AAOSwe9Fb7a6L/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/FHwAAOSwPTlb7a6P/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/EEwAAOSw-rxb7a6U/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/w0MAAOSwXMxb7a6W/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/GAEAAOSwEJZb7a6d/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/AAOSwypZb7a6k/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/-e0AAOSwZltb7a6v/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/frEAAOSwPrtb7a6z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/P7wAAOSwhJFb7a63/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/TDAAAOSwD~Fb7a6~/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1gxNjAw/z/mFIAAOSwwhxb7a7H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "98338", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "turnip579", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 23, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 407}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "'66 Fender MUSTANG - MINT CONDITION", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1966"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Mustang"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Beige"]}]}, "HitCount": 73, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2425.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
