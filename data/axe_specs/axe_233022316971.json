I replaced the 1 ply white pickguard with a Japanese '62 Reissue mint green 3 ply and the matching knobs and pickup covers, as the original had numerous cracks around the mounting screw holes, and was stained. Trem arm is new also. As to the status of this, it has been played, as there are a few dings and chips (pictured), and a small bit of fretwear on several frets. But it does have fast action, quiet pots, solid feel, pretty decent tone and not ice picky, especially for a lower cost guitar. This has real tuners, not the cheap stamped metal cover units, and really, all this would need would maybe a an upgrade of the pickups if you don't care for the tone, or, want to match up with your main axe and use this as a backup. The mint green guard on the black body looks sharp. Frankly, a great platform for your own sonic adventures. Anyway, priced reasonably. Please check pictures for details on physical condition. I've taken pics both with, and without flash to try to better show color, finish and details. Any questions? Please ask now, not later, and thanx for checking out this listing. Thanx for taking a look at this auction, please check my other auctions for vintage gear, pa gear, and a/v equipment among other things. Good luck if you decide to bid!", "ItemID": "233022316971", "EndTime": "2018-11-29T04:58:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-27T03:06:17.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/20th-Anniv-Squier-Stratocaster-Black-w-Mint-Green-P-G-Padded-Gig-Bag-/233022316971", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Urbandale, Iowa", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330223169718080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzMlg2OTQ=/z/AUgAAOSwFSNb9L~9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eiIAAOSwnWpb9MCL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RJQAAOSwatBb9MCk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODU2WDE0NzU=/z/69YAAOSwpLdb9MDL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/6wkAAOSwK5Fb9MDX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4Nlg3Mzg=/z/btMAAOSwkHFb9MER/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4Nlg3NzM=/z/7XQAAOSwHu5b9ME7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Nt4AAOSww7tb9MFX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7ngAAOSwPeVb9MF1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VfwAAOSw~BRb9MGQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDA0WDExNzg=/z/IcQAAOSwjoFb9MHF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4Nlg3Njk=/z/qhMAAOSwySZb9MID/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "50322", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aguitarman", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1877, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.3}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 129.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 129.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***r", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 111}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "20th Anniv.
