{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you are looking at this post, you already know what it is. It is the heavier, very, very rare, non chambered and most highly regarded 2004 Gibson Les Paul Standard Limited Edition (1 of 275) in the most beautiful and sought after Manhattan Midnight Blue burst. Pictures honestly don\u2019t do this guitar justice. I\u2019ve had the pleasure to own 6 of these at one point or another and this burst/top is by FAR the nicest I\u2019ve ever come across, but please look at the pictures even though they don\u2019t show how nice the top is. What you don\u2019t know is that this guitar is in excellent condition and it hasn\u2019t been played much. Frets have all the life left. It comes with an excellent condition black HSC. Original pickups, tuners and everything else as well; guitar is all original and not modified in any way. Everyone knows that these early to mid 2000\u2019s were maybe the best years for Gibsons period, and that they don\u2019t make them like this any more. As interesting as that may sound for a 13-year-old guitar, there is NO buckle rash and the back is beautiful just like the rest of the guitar. Other than some pick swirls on the top that can be buffed out to make mirror like and new again, there are no chips, dents, or any blemishes really. It was purchased in 2004, set up, played periodically for a short time, and then put away in its case til now; again, I\u2019ll let the pictures do the talking. Honestly, it is almost impossible coming across this particular Limited Edition Gibson Les Paul Standard from this year in this good of condition and this prominent of a burst/top. It has the 60\u2019s slim neck that is not as slim as these newer slim taper necks, but it is definitely thinner than 50\u2019s necks. It is medium weight, weighing in at about 9lbs. The tone and sustain is simply ridiculous, but I\u2019ll let you be the judge. Unplugged, the strings ring out loudly and endlessly and is well above average and this is the way I determine the quality of my Gibsons. If it sound good unplugged, it\u2019s a keeper, and this one goes beyond that. Plugged in to my Marshall SL5 it is a match made in heaven and being a non chambered model, the tone and sustain is second to none. It has been set up, the frets are polished and it is ready to rock. It is a 15-year-old guitar and it may have a blemish somewhere which is normal for a guitar of this age, but even that is minimal as you can see in the pictures; it does not photograph, nor does it affect playability. The top is absolutely amazing. Honestly, as stated before, here is that rare opportunity to purchase this 15-year-old, excellent condition Limited Edition Gibson Les Paul Standard Limited Edition from a great year at a really, really good price compared to what other people are selling these for when they do appear and in much, much worse condition. Don\u2019t let this one slip away as I know it will not last and I speak from experience. Due to the very attractive price, I know that I will be contacted a lot and with that said, I won\u2019t be able to hold the guitar for anyone; it\u2019ll be first come first serve. Furthermore, I reserve the right to end this sale at any time should my guitar sell locally or on other websites listed. I\u2019ve described this guitar to the best of my ability. Please ask any questions you may have and I\u2019ll try to answer in a timely manner.
