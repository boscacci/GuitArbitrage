{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding the serial number dates this to 1970--1972 and the pots are 71 but the embossed Gibson named t-top pickups only came as a package in late 71 into 1972 so this is one of those 2 years. Everything except the tuners mentioned below are original (and now the tuners are as well) but the headstock volute is small which i usually associate with 69--71. It's in very very clean condition for a nearly 50 year old guitar--other than the depicted wear on the top of the headstock it presents like a demo from a few feet away and it sounds and plays like it just rolled off the line.The neck is straight and in great shape--front and back are excellent and even the embossed pickup covers are only slightly tarnished--the neck right below the volute has a slight amount of checking visible in the scans--very minor--the truss rod works fine and the action is set for my preferences at 3/32nds on the 12th fret e string with no buzzing--the frets are excellent as is the Brazilian board and the binding is clean throughoutthe tuners as so many did were replaced by grovers but the owner kept the originals in the case pocket and i had the grover holes filled and the originals put back on--they work perfectly-- by my luthier who also intonated it--cleaned and polished it--did a set up for my preferences and put new d'darrio 13s on it--the heavier strings really bring out the potential of this guitar especially for jazz and blues.the purchase receipt from the original owner--dated 2000--is included--it sold then for $2900.the case is rugged but the latches all work with a bit of finesse on one of them and the interior is clean--the tab for the pocket pull up is missing and i never got around to fixing this because i don't gig the instrument and it typically hangs on a wall or in a stand--In 50+ years of playing I've found the the ES-175 is my favorite jazz and blues guitar--the big body knocks the feedback down if you want to get dirty on the blues and the clean sound through my Marshall 215C is heavenly. I will sell overseas but contact me for a shipping quote--from my zip to Spain just cost $170 (i'm as far north and west as you can get in the mainland US)thanks for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling as well as a setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392204856183", "EndTime": "2019-01-10T20:08:47.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-31T20:08:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1971-72-Gibson-ES-175-Blonde-embossed-t-tops-w-OHSC-excellent-all-original-/392204856183", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Port Townsend, Washington", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3922048561838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mjc=/z/ZDIAAOSwkERcKnRA/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE3N1gxNjAw/z/3zEAAOSw5r1cKnRH/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTI4/z/hYQAAOSwYUZcKnRP/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTYw/z/yDoAAOSwNrZcKnRV/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjE1/z/YDUAAOSwz3FcKnRh/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bnkAAOSwQGFcKnRs/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEzNlgxNjAw/z/~0sAAOSw6hNcKnR3/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTI4/z/bRYAAOSwDmxcKnR~/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDMz/z/sPQAAOSwO-pcKnSE/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5NDg=/z/Jj4AAOSwQ5pcKnSN/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2ODk=/z/biYAAOSw1jpcKnSX/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjIw/z/LqkAAOSwylBcKnSr/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "98368", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "glemons3p26", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3694, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 24, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2205.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2205.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 928}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1971-72 Gibson ES-175 Blonde embossed t-tops w OHSC excellent all original", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural Blonde"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-175"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1972"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood", "Laminate"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 415, "Subtitle": "offers considered", "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2230.05, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "RU", "AL", "AD", "BY", "BE", "BA", "BG", "HR", "CY", "EE", "FI", "GG", "IT", "JE", "LV", "LT", "MK", "MT", "MD", "MC", "ME", "PT", "RO", "SM", "RS", "SK", "SI", "SJ", "UA", "VA", "BM", "GL", "MX", "PM", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "if an offer is accepted i will re-list the guitar for the offer amount and the buyer will have a few hours to make payment unless someone else sees it and buys it at the offered amount", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
