{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a very interesting custom Gibson Les Paul studio from 1992. It is in good mechanical condition and has lots of custom work and parts. There is some swirling and wearing on the paint in some places, still looks great overall, please refer to the pictures. There is a custom 3rd pickup added and all 3 pickups were replaced with Seymour Duncan hum-bucker pickups, I don\u2019t remember the Models of the pickups off hand. The pickups are wired for optional coil tapping for simulated single coil and phase switch, each pickup has an individual switch. All three pickups or any combination can be selected at the same time giving any number of Tone combinations possible. This is a great playing guitar with low fast action, one of my favorite guitars to play. The frets are in great condition and still have plenty of life left. The Bigsby B7 is installed with a Vibramate so there are no holes drilled into the guitar. The locking tuners mix well with the bigsby and doesn\u2019t have the tuning problems of other tremolos. There is a case that goes with this guitar but it is not in the best condition. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. USA buyers only. Thanks for looking.\u00a0", "ItemID": "183681715711", "EndTime": "2019-02-18T06:50:11.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-12T05:29:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1992-Gibson-Les-Paul-Studio-Black-3-Pickup-Bibsby-B7-Coil-Tap-Phase-Switch-USA-/183681715711", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Worth, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1836817157118080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/a~kAAOSwbu1cYlax/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/V2sAAOSw1XRcYla0/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FqQAAOSwdfVcYla1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vCUAAOSwgs5cYla3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/H0kAAOSw5apcYla5/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/PaMAAOSwgZ5cYla6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RJkAAOSwxXZcYla7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eJUAAOSwwPtcYla8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/stQAAOSwXHpcYla-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sM4AAOSwFstcYla~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZP8AAOSwJjNcYlbB/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mjgAAOSwqiRcYlbC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "76109", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "watchslob28", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 611, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 93.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 899.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 899.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "y***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 7232}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1992 Gibson Les Paul Studio Black 3 Pickup Bibsby B7 Coil Tap Phase Switch USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1992"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Studio"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 26, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=979046034", "StoreName": "flyfix"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
