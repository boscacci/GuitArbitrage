{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a great example of an Epiphone Les Paul made in the infamous Samick plant in Korea. It has a transitional tenon, mahogany body and neck with rosewood fretboard. This guitar does have normal play wear with little dings and dents of the worst has been pictured but by no means is this a case queen this guitar is meant to be played and it plays very well. Frets are in great condition with only slight wear I went ahead and upgraded this guitar with new set of paf style humbuckers, 8.2k each, connected to a Pro wiring harness so the coils can be split in series and in parallel....brand new three-way switch was also done along with a complete cleaning, fretboard oiling and strung up with GHS 10 boomers. Great guitar for any level. Comes with a hard shell case that is in fair to good condition and the special wrench for the truss rod which is a Gibson style truss rod... the guitars action is set to medium low with no fret buzzing up and down the neck... I hate to get rid of it but it's just one of those things too many guitars and not enough time.... please ask any and all questions that you may have and have a wonderful holiday season... thank you", "ItemID": "273600740037", "EndTime": "2018-12-08T19:53:52.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-08T16:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Custom-Pro-Electric-Guitar-1993-MIK-SAMICK-/273600740037", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Strongsville, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736007400378080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/8dwAAOSwHGxb9YPu/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/fNEAAOSwmaJb9YPy/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/YSkAAOSw~XZb9YP2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/jiAAAOSwLKhb9YP6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/dUMAAOSw3BJb9YP-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/k8QAAOSwNphb9YQC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/1qkAAOSwqoxb9YQF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/DzgAAOSw27lb9YQJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/rQ8AAOSwQ5pb9YQR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/JMoAAOSw1jpb9YQb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/UksAAOSwVIBb9YZf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/4EcAAOSwVBRb9YZk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "44149", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "thogs1999", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1524, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 429.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 429.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 23}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro Electric Guitar -1993  MIK SAMICK ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone By Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1993"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}]}, "HitCount": 39, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 434.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
