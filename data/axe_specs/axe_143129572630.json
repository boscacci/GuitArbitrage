You are looking at a 1994 Fender Eric Clapton \"Blackie\" Signature Stratocaster Electric Guitar. This is the Artist signature model that closely replicates the famous \"Blackie\" Strat that Eric Clapton plays. This is one of the first batch of Eric Clapton Artist Series models that were built from 1988-2001. This guitar has some really cool upgrades. The former owner changed these electronics in 2006. He installed genuine '59 Fender Stratocaster Reissue pickups and a 3-position tone stack. (See picture #8). The tone stack is the center knob and has an audible click when you change the positions. He removed the TBX tone control. It no longer is battery powered. It sounds AMAZING! If you are into Blues and Classic Rock you'll love the tone you can get out of this Clapton Stratocaster! Our luthier did a complete setup. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Nut Width: 1.65\" Weight: 7.90 lbs. Complete Package with Fender Palomino G&G Hard Shell Case is Included! Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. Cosmetics: Excellent Condition. A couple of very light strumming scratches on the pickguard. Neck, Fingerboard and Headstock in great shape. Pristine. Dripping with \"Mojo\". It is used. Not perfect. Overall, a really nice guitar. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story.
