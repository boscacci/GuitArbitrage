{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Beautiful Telecaster Modern Player Plus with deluxe G&G Fender Pro hard shell case - the photos do not do it justice. This guitar has seen only very careful use in my smoke-free home studio. It would almost pass for new - it has only a few minor pick marks on the pick guard. This model offers an incredible range of tones; it features a Fender modern player humbucker at the bridge with a coil-splitter toggle, a Strat single-coil in the middle and a Fender lipstick single coil in the neck position. Vintage-style hardware chrome throughout (tuners, string trees, bridge). 5-way switching. The guitar is completely original, and has needed no adjustment or work of any kind. It plays as well as any Fender I've ever played. The case is in terrific shape also, with only a couple of minor scuffs on the vinyl trim and a tiny nick in the tolex (see pics). This guitar currently sells for $499.99, and the case for $81.64 (Musician's Friend). Somebody is gonna get a heckuva deal! Will sell to bidders in the lower 48 ONLY - no exceptions. Please see photos and contact me with any questions.
