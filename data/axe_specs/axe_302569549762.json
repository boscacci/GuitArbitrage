Serial no. 022. Nice sounding guitar and getting hard to find. Comes from a private collection, has a couple minor dings on the back neck heel. Comes, trem bar and custom hardshell case. GUITAR BUYER MAGAZINE: \u201cThe Nelsonic\u2019s unusual mix of Fender flavours (the scale length and vibrato system) and Gibson influences (the two humbuckers and mahogany body works really well, while still managing to generate the feel of something that\u2019s a bit different from the rest. The sounds and playability are both so good that this guitar feels almost addictive. It\u2019s very hard to put down once you start playing it, and when you grow used to the fact that beneath the quirky image lies an achingly gorgeous and highly usable guitar, there\u2019s almost no going back.\u201d Mahogany BodyFinished in Rocket Ship Red Nitro LacquerMatching HeadstockRock Maple Neck with Tung Oil FinishEbony Fingerboard with atom Inlays at the 12th fretFlattened C Neck Carve22 Medium Jumbo Frets12.5\u2033 Fingerboard Radius25.5\u2033 Scale Length1 11/16ths Nut WidthGraphtech NutGotoh 510 Tremolo15:1 Sperzel TunersGold HardwareCampbell \u201cStandards\u201d Pickups by Dimarzio Alnico V Magnets Wound to 7.25K and 8.65K3-Way Switch, One Volume, Two Tone KnobsCustom Fit G&G Hardshell Case This guitar has hardly been used and apart from the few small chips you can see in the picture, it's in excellent condition.
