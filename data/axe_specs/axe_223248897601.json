{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Used 2000-2001 MIM Fender Stratocaster, made in the Ensenada Plant. Wine red body, solid maple neck. Had it for many years now, only selling it because I'm moving and can't really afford to take everything with me. Comes with a pretty heavy duty strap, a set of aftermarket strap-locks, and the original tremolo bar. Probably needs to be set up, especially if you wanna use the tremolo, since I have the spring tension set pretty high. Electronics all work, a few screws missing off the pickguard, but not enough that it's a problem at all, and they could be replaced for a few cents if if they bother you. It's in pretty good shape, though there's a bit of wear here and there, some discoloration on the back cover, a bit of buckle rash on the body near there (tried to get a good picture of that, but you can't really see it all that well), but otherwise just a few very minor dings or scratches you really have to be looking for, you should take a look at the pictures to see everything in a bit more detail. It plays great, though it'll need some new strings and such, the ones on it are a couple years old at this point at least.", "ItemID": "223248897601", "EndTime": "2018-12-01T02:14:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-24T02:14:35.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Stratocaster-MIM-2001-wine-red-maple-neck-electric-guitar-mexico-/223248897601", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Wilmington, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232488976018080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjkw/z/QyUAAOSwRrlb-LAh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MTE=/z/-bEAAOSwEVtb-LAg/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HRwAAOSwcdxb-LAi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MTY=/z/lOsAAOSw-yJb-LAf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg3WDE2MDA=/z/DXIAAOSwfhlb-LAf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2Mjg=/z/cLUAAOSwe~lb-LAf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MjY=/z/VxsAAOSwosdb-LAf/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDM4/z/1OIAAOSwCvFb-LAh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU2NFgxNjAw/z/XSUAAOSwrQxb-LAh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JdQAAOSwYd5b-LAh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mPEAAOSwQZVb-LAh/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "45177", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bobayhol", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 651, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 15, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 270.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 270.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "d***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 43}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Stratocaster, MIM 2001, wine red, maple neck, electric guitar, mexico", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Mexico"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}]}, "HitCount": 609, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
