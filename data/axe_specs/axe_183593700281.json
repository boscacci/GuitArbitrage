Message me before buying for a shipping quote. 1998 MIM Fender Deluxe Players Stratocaster Electric Guitar w/Gig Bag For sale is a beautiful, 1998 Fender Super Strat! The 'Deluxe Super Strat' is the predecessor to the currently available Deluxe Player's Strat and had several unique features. Specifically, this guitar has a 9.5\" radius, a slightly wider 43mm nut and Fender's highly desirable Super Fat \"Super\" Strat pickups. Other specifications include Deluxe gold hardware, an Ash body, a one-piece maple neck with 21 medium jumbo frets, a 4-ply tortoise shell pickguard and a very cool, push-push bridge pickup activator switch. This guitar is the epitome of natural, age-caused relicing. It's in well-played condition with tarnishing on the gold hardware, plenty of fingerboard wear, moderate fret wear, small/superficial neck pocket cracks and several dings, scratches, pick marks and buckle rash. At only 6lbs 15oz, it's noticeably light and comfortable. Just remember, this instrument is well-used and might need a fret leveling at some point. Ships in a Case.
