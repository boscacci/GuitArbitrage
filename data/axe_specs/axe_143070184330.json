{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender 2011 FSR 57 Vintage Reissue Stratocaster Candy Apple RedThis guitar is exactly like the 1980's Red Strat that David Gilmour played even up through his last tour! I bought this Fender Special Run 57 Vintage Reissue in 2013. I've played a bit in studio/rehearsal, a few gigs, but it has sat mostly at home. Guitar is in fantastic shape - especially the neck. I put EMG DG20 pickups to make it like Gilmour's in within a year of buying it. I also put new strap buttons on it cause the original ones the strap kept falling off that I had. I can't find the originals strap buttons. The tremolo block and bar is a Callaham - I replaced the original one cause the bar snapped off in it as it got stuck. There is a few blemishes on this guitar but they are very minor, most of them look like natural wear since it is a Nitro Finish. Also, I installed the 5 way selector and do not have the original 3 way. The original pickups and controls were sold as well. Also the decals are not lacquered over like Fender did in the original 50's Strats. The Original Contour Body decal chipped a tiny little bit but it's not bad. It's got the standard 57 reissue 7.25\" radius on the fretboard and has a soft 57 V profile. Comes with the original vintage style tweed case. Great feel on this guitar, let me know if you have questions. This guitar is amazing and it breaks my heart to let it go but I need the money. Priced to move!!
