{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1989 fender Stratocaster made in Japan. I purchased this guitar the way it is now.Original tremolo system has been replaced with a kahler type tremolo system. The body has been routed to accept the aftermarket tremolo.and I know for sure that the bridge pickup has been replaced and has a lace sensor dually pick up and has been coil tapped. The other pickups I assumed to be original but I am unsure. The guitar sounds awesome and has many tunnel variations with the lace sensor and coil tap. I have too many guitars and much bigger projects to take on so I'm letting go of a few.The guitar is used and does show signs of use such as scratches knicks paint chips dents and what have you. Guitar is sold as is where is with no returns.
