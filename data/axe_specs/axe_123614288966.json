Paring down my collection, so I decided to part with my 2007 Midnight Blue Rickenbacker 360 guitar. Hardly used. Excellent condition. Plays great, no issues. Comes with original hardshell case and two sets of Rickenbacker strings and the original Rickenbacker guitar cloth. Free FedEx shipping included to USA only. Honest dealer; see my feedbacks. The Rickenbacker 360 is famous for the \"Beatles sound\" from the 1960's. Its special contour around the body perimeter is one of the most comfortable guitars of all time. Its body is carved from one piece of maple with a precisely fitted piece of maple for the back. The slim neck is made of maple with a rosewood fingerboard and dual truss rod. Two updated Hi-Gain pickups are their own high output pickups designed to be able to go from a clear clean to a biting overdrive. The bound body and Rosewood fingerboard, inlayed with triangular pearloid markers, provide an exceptionally attractive appearance. Stereo output is standard.
