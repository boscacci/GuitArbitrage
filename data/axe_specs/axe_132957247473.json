{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "\u25c6 DENON Denon DP-55M record player USED Description Purchased around 2013, it is with a genuine hard case. Since it is a musical instrument which was not used almost, there are no conspicuous scratches such as dent marks. I think whether there is neck warp. Payment We only accept PayPal payments.
