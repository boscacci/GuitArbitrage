{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Vintage 1975 Ovation 1117-1 Acoustic Guitar with Original hardshell case. Online description: GeneralThe first Ovation electric-acoustic guitar appeared in the late-'60s after the closing of Charles Kaman\u2019s helicopter design firm. Borrowing from his blade designs, Kamen built innovative guitars with rounded composite plastic backs and Sitka spruce tops. These synthetic backs and patented electronics earned Ovation a reputation as one of the most innovative guitar makers in the world. Endorsed by Glen Campbell and later Robert Fripp and Melissa Ethridge, Ovations like the Legend, AX, Elite, and Adamas Series are acoustics made for active performers. Okay...
