{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This has been my favorite guitar for years. It's been a workhorse. When I had it made I wanted it to be a bit lighter than my heavy Les Paul's which get heavier the longer on stage. So we came up with this slightly thinner chambered mahogany body and slimmer mahogany neck. Little did I know I would like the chambers so much. They really make it brighter on clean or simulated acoustics tones and actually give it depth on the chunkier stuff. Features some pretty great sounding Guitarheads gold post zebra pickups. Wilkinson gold bridge and tuners, Gibson speed knobs and all parts custom wirng harness.custom routed nut on bottom 3 strings which you will love the effect on sound and playability. The action is extremely low so she plays extremely easy. Custom engraved neck plate with rubber gasket. Let Me make clear this is a guitar I used on the road so she has some dings and dents which I tried to document in the pics. She will be well packed and fully insured so bid with confidence. To sum it up if you been looking for a guitar that really sounds good and place great but don't wanna break the bank here it's is.", "ItemID": "254040985403", "EndTime": "2019-01-02T22:54:23.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-26T22:54:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-Les-paul-Guitar-Bolt-neck-/254040985403", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "West Plains, Missouri", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2540409854038080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/HZEAAOSw6CRcH43W/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9~MAAOSw76lcH43X/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/I7QAAOSwq2xcH43T/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/es0AAOSwVAtcH43X/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jJ4AAOSw3bZcH43a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/va4AAOSwVCpcH43Z/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IeoAAOSwSONcH43a/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "65775", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "gibson1957james", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 115, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 102.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***z", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 136}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom Les paul Guitar Bolt on neck", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}]}, "HitCount": 146, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 105.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
