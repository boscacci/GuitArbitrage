{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale I have a Fender Lite Ash Telecaster in excellent condition. This is a fantastic guitar with a ton of unique features that make it a screaming deal. I absolutely love it, but I just don't have room for it in the collection, so now it needs someone to come swoop it up and take it to it's forever home. This guitar is completely stock:-Ash body with natural finish-Birds eye maple neck with smooth satin finish-Birds eye maple fret board with abalone inlays-22 Med/Jumbo frets-Cast/sealed tuners-REAL Seymour Duncan Alnico II pro's in neck and bridge positions (not just 'Duncan designed'!)-2 String trees-Oversized strap buttons-3 position switch (N, NB, B) with master vol and tone pots-Vintage style bridge with brass 3-barrel saddles-Weighs in at just about 7lbs, 10oz. (Legend has it the 'Lite' referred to the color, not the weight. Either way still a shade lighter than most others)This thing rips. I love it but I literally don't have room for it. The neck is dead-straight, frets show a little wear but have tons of life left, and there's barely a ding or scratch on the thing. The Chrome is shiny. It's got that great c-shaped neck feel and classic not-too-hot Tele tone everyone's looking for. Action is great - it plays fast but you can really dig in with a pick, fingers, or a slide. Intonation is great and it stays in tune very well. This is a true player's guitar that will serve someone very well for a long time. Comes with a Fender hard shell case also in great shape.", "ItemID": "264006973115", "EndTime": "2018-11-01T23:30:45.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-25T23:30:45.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Lite-Ash-Telecaster-Solid-Body-Electric-Guitar-w-hard-case-/264006973115", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Somerville, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640069731158080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTk4/z/dE4AAOSw7SpbyRJa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iJ4AAOSwT0pbyRHT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t3gAAOSwhh9byRJa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ukEAAOSwwb1byRJa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gzoAAOSwu3dbyRHW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YfYAAOSwTxpbyRJb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/t9sAAOSwDX9byRHR/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/W7QAAOSw--xbyRHT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jzAAAOSwWotbyRHT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/h~0AAOSwWW5byRHT/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ozgAAOSwTFBbyRac/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FyQAAOSw21RbyRbH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "02145", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "nativesoundandlight", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 7, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 550.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 454}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Lite Ash Telecaster Solid Body Electric Guitar w/ hard case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood, Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2006"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Lite Ash Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Light Wood Grain"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut, Volume Knob, With Pickup"]}]}, "HitCount": 225, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
