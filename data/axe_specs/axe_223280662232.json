{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Very nice playing short scale Dixon strat copy has switch to engage Humbuckers or disengage for single coil. A rare guitar with an well made comfortable bigger neck. Was told by previous owner the guitar is mij but probably MIK? The pickups are stock and sound nice with good mid range. Guitar Was just setup by my luthier at third rock music, guitar has a 1 inch or so stress crack in the right side and 1/3rd inch stress crack on left side neck pocket (last 2 pictures) but is overall just a quality guitar. The hard shell case is NOT included in the listing, this guitar will be carefully packed to ensure a safe delivery, thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "223280662232", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T21:47:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-11T21:47:36.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980s-Dixon-Lawsuit-Electric-Guitar-Cream-Humbuckers-And-Coil-Splitter-MIK-/223280662232", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2232806622328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/a58AAOSwIKNcBvTU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/~oYAAOSwTSlcBvTR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/HjwAAOSw7HhcBvTW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/qTIAAOSwi7VcBvTY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/r7gAAOSw96ZcBvTb/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDQ1MA==/z/fSAAAOSwHGJcBvUH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/LwcAAOSwG49cFbVU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/hIMAAOSw3bZcFbV6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "45230", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "onthereeldeals", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 872, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 5, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 168.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 168.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 494}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980's Dixon Lawsuit Electric Guitar Cream Humbuckers And Coil Splitter MIK?", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Dixon"]}]}, "HitCount": 135, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 171.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
