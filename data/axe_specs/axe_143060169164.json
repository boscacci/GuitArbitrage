{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Was purchased brand new in 2015 and I believe this was the final year Fender made this model. I am the original owner. It is in nearly new condition. Have played it only a handful of times at church or in home. Has all the buttons and whistles including the Fender S1 switching system (installed in the volume knob) which gives you an additional 5 pickup options, Fender's 3rd generation Noiseless Pickups, satin neck finish, fender locking tuners, 2 point tremolo with pop-in whammy bar, medium jumbo frets, bone nut, deluxe string saddles, and a cutaway heel for easier access to the higher frets. Comes with Fender deluxe hard shell case and includes locking guitar strap and all accessories it came with. The color is in beautiful Olympic Pearl with maple neck and a rosewood top. Everything is original factory stock as it came from Fender, has been kept in it's case, and well cared for. This is an opportunity to own a genuine American made Fender Deluxe Stratocaster at a more affordable price that is in excellent barely used condition, so please research and know what you are buying before you purchase. Please let me know if you have any questions.", "ItemID": "143060169164", "EndTime": "2019-01-18T22:17:26.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-21T12:54:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2015-Fender-American-Deluxe-Stratocaster-SSS-Olympic-Pearl-/143060169164", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fostoria, Ohio", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1430601691648080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pKkAAOSw8LZcHBq1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-VIAAOSwnZJcHBq3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WFEAAOSw11BcHBq6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/C0cAAOSw8OFcHBq8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mWQAAOSwfMlcHBq-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FZUAAOSwT5tcHBrA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/p0gAAOSwBfhcHNj8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/L~kAAOSwAP9cHOEr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mW8AAOSwckVcHOEt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XHkAAOSw27lcHUf3/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bbEAAOSwjQVcKkBx/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "44830", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "chadj1984", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 271, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1049.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1049.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 677}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2015 Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster SSS Olympic Pearl", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder", "Maple", "Rosewood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Delux"]}]}, "HitCount": 403, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
