{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Incredible guitar that sounds and plays like a vintage or custom shop instrument. I am so impressed with this guitar but it's a choice between keeping this or my beloved Les Paul I've owned since 1997, and sentimentality wins out. This thing is so \"live\" when you strum it it is scary! It is better than any Gibson Firebird I have ever played, including Custom Shop ones. The pickup has a great bite to it and overall it sounds and plays great. The only cosmetic issue is a small ding on the backside of the headstock. Someone who is good with superglue or clear nail polish could easy touch it up, but I haven't bothered as you don't see it from the front and I would just make a mess of it. Here's a link to the Epiphone page for the guitar that has videos of Joe Bonamassa playing one and A/B-ing with his vintage Firebird. it is amazing how close they are http://www.epiphone.com/News/Features/2016/Epiphone-Ltd-Ed-Joe-Bonamassa-Treasure-Firebird-I.aspx It also comes with an Epiphone hardshell case in addition to the signature gig bag, hand-signed COA and all case candy. According to Epiphone..._______________________ A \"Treasured\" Vintage Firebird Reborn: The new Epiphone Ltd. Ed. Joe Bonamassa \"Treasure\" Firebird-I Outfit was closely modeled after Joe's original 1963 Firebird. Joe worked closely with Epiphone's legendary luthiers in Nashville, Tennessee to recreate his rare single pickup Firebird that was made in the first year of the guitar's production at the Epiphone & Gibson factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan. And according to Joe, the new Epiphone \"Treasure\" Firebird-I far exceeded his expectations. \"The guitar is called 'Treasure' as it's based on the '63 Firebird that was graciously gifted to me 4 years ago,\" said Bonamassa. \"We A/B'd the new Epiphone with my two original 63s. The Epi's play and sound better! Ugh... I just paid $12,000 for one!\" Reverse Firebird\u2122 body shape Original Thru-Neck Construction The new Epiphone Ltd. Ed. Joe Bonamassa \"Treasure\" Firebird-I Outfit features a Mahogany body with a 9-piece Laminated Mahogany/Walnut neck with a period-correct early 1960s Rounded \"C\" profile measured after Joe's original. Epiphone improved on the vintage neck design by including a dual action adjustable truss rod. The Firebird was the first electric guitar to feature \"thru-neck\" construction along with the iconic Reverse Firebird\u2122 body shape. The neck has a Rosewood fingerboard with a 14\" radius, 22 medium jumbo frets, classic \"Dot\" inlays, and a 24.75\" scale length. The \"Treasure\" Firebird-I comes in two color finishes, a classic Tobacco Sunburst and Polymist Gold exclusive to Joe's Signature Firebird. The historic-styled white and black-layered pickguard has the classic \"Firebird\" logo. A premium custom gigbag is included. ________________________________ Note that this is a LONG guitar and the case is big. It will require a big box to ship I may have to send the gig bag sepatrately. If so, I'll ship the gig bag for free, but buyer pays for shipping of the guitar and hard case. Regardlss, it will likely be a little more expensive than normal guitar shipping costs. It is an awesome guitar and I wish I could keep it. Alas, we can't keep them all.
