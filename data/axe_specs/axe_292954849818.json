{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "2015 gibson les paul standard. Condition is Used,but this guitar is in like new condition. I have bought and sold over 100 guitars on EBay. I think I want this, then I think I want that. Live in a small town in West Texas. Only way I can test and play different guitars is purchase them and play them. I have had this guitar a lot longer than most. Love the wide thin neck. A very qualified luthier out of Dallas Tx, removed all the total, computerized crap out of the control cavity and replaced the pots with high quality pots and wiring. Also replaced the \u201cautomatic\u201d tuners with locking Grover\u2019s. All the parts that were replaced, I have kept and will be included with the purchase. Also replaced the stock pickups with Seymore Duncan \u201c59\u2019s\u201d. Unbelievable difference in the sound and clarity after getting rid of the computer chip crap. Check my feedback. It\u2019s 100% since forever. Any questions feel free to call or Tx me. 940-203-1071. Hard shell, rectangle case included.
