{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a real nice loaded Stratocaster body I picked up in a trade some time ago. I had it tucked away for a future partscaster project but am doing some house cleaning so it is time to let it go. Was told it is from an early 90's manufacture MIM Squier Series Stratocaster. I have had a few of these Mexican made Squier Strats and the quality is on par with their more exspensive Fender blue/gray label counterparts produced during the same era. The Squier Series however had cheaper hardware and the bridge and pickguard spacing are set up for import specs. This one looks to have it's original pickups and electronics, the pickguard has been replaced with a newer single ply one, the pickup covers and control knobs are aftermarket as well. The body is about 1 5/8 inch thick, solid wood and has a little weight to it. I do have the back plate which I will include minus the mounting screws, it is missing it's tremolo unit and springs as well as the strap buttons. A few things of note: the body color looks to be more of a cream or beige shade and doesn't look like it is from aging. The neck pictured is Not included, just the body. I have tested the electronics and everything is working however the 5-way switch is a little scratchy toward the bridge postion. Being sold as is for part/project, please look at all of the pictures closely and if you have any questions feel free to ask.
