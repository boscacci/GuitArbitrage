{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Epiphone SG G-400, Project Guitar, Bound Neck, with original Grover tuners. This is a project guitar, and was this way when I got it. It is more of a project than I want to undertake. The previous owner painted the top white, not a great job as the pictures show. A P-90 was installed in the bridge position, not sure of the brand, but looks similar to a GFS brand I have seen. The original Epiphone bridge pickup is in the neck position. The P-90 does not make much sound, not sure if the pickup is bad, or the volume pot. The neck pickup works fine, along with the volume and tone knob. Someone did take a little wood out for the P-90 , but a humbucker with a pickup ring will cover that up. There are no cracks or breaks in the body or neck. This was a nice guitar before someone decided to do this, there are not any big dings or nicks on the guitar. Someone sanded the back of the neck, taking off the glass finish, which makes the neck feel better. Almost no fret wear on the 22 fret Rosewood fretboard which plays really nice. Has a bound neck, which most of the G-400 guitars do not have. This is a project for sure, not too pretty, but with some electronics work, a set up, could be a great player. I will include a basic Epiphone humbucker with a pickup ring you can install in the guitar to replace the P-90. No case, but will be packed very well. Feel free to make an offer!!
