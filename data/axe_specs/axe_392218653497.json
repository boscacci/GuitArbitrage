{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "non-paying bidders please note--if payment/communication is not received within 24 hours it will be presumed the bidder is agreeing to cancel the bid and i will re-list the item as is allowed under ebay rules--bidders with less than 10 positive feedback please contact me before bidding Beautiful pre-Norlin no volute 1967 Gibson ES-330 in the coveted iconic cherry finish--in excellent condition with minimal tarnishing--all original and the P-90s are perfect with that classic Gibson snarlFull hollow body sut surprisingly little feedback.The case is in terrible shape outside and has been heavily duct taped but is in surprisingly good shape inside with no bad odors. It protects the guitar perfectly if you can get past the worn at the heels tramp on the street look of it.The only thing to mention is that like most if not all older hollowbody 330 guitars the top has sunk just a tad on this one--rather than run the pickup poles up to max my luthier build a brazilian rosewood shim--about 3/32nds of an inch--that is very discrete--beautifully made--and lifts the bridge pup up to where the pickup can speak to the strings in a normal position--the shim is not permanent and can be removed without leaving a mark but it makes the guitar much more stable to have it in place in terms of the sound options. You can see this in especially the 3rd photo.The sound is divine--both pickups together are a very familiar rock sound from the late 60s and there are Rickenbacker and Gretsch Beatles tones to be had--the cosmetics are as you see in the scans--minimal checking--minimal tarnishing--beautiful finish--excellent binding and the frets are also in great shape--the brazilian fretboard is in excellent shape--the neck is in excellent shape and the neck angle is perfect with action set right now at 1/8th for my preferences--truss rod is working and is not maxed out--the guitar present beautifully and sounds even better no reserve--the buy it now is $3400 which is reasonable in my estimationthanks for looking please ask any questions prior to bidding and i will do my best to answer them--between the scans and the description there are no hidden secrets--i will ship to Europe but please ask for shipping quotes before placing a bid--i'll have to open up your country to accept bids and want to screen this process first shipping is an estimate--if you live on the west coast it might cost less--east coast will cost more but i'll eat the difference and provide a scan of the original receipt upon request--remember that insurance is $2 per $100 of declared value-- i have perfect feedback in over 4500 transactions--all my instruments are completely gone over before i offer them--this one has new strings--a clean and polish and fretboard oiling and has been intonated as well as setup for my preferences-- thank you for looking--the guitar is also for sale on Reverb as well as locally so this auction may end if sold elsewhere--", "ItemID": "392218653497", "EndTime": "2019-01-28T20:04:34.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-18T20:04:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch":
