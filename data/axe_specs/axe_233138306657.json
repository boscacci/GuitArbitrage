{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale my beloved and babied Billie Joe Jr by Gibson. If you are searching for this guitar you probably already know way more than I can tell you. This gem was made to replicate the main guitar Billie used for pretty much the last decade and it is a work of art. It is loaded with Billie\u2019s custom H90 pickups to virtually eliminate hum and unwanted noises while maximizing gain and power in every chord. This baby is stage ready, wether you are playing a small gig or a stadium. It comes in a beautifully aged white that only gets better with age. The white version is extremely RARE and it is the only one I have seen for sale in a while, only one on eBay right now! It is in awesome condition, although it does show some some signs of use, nothing major as this axe was very well taken care of. I am getting married soon and some of my toys unfortunately have to go, though I\u2019m sure whoever ends up winning it will love it as much as I do. It also includes the original hardshell case with combination lock and its\u2019 killer looking leopard lining. Don\u2019t miss your chance to own this piece of Rock n Roll history, good luck and happy bidding! I will ship FAST! Within 24 hrs of cleared payment.", "ItemID": "233138306657", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T00:49:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-19T00:49:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Billie-Joe-Armstrong-Les-Paul-Jr-Gibson-White-VERY-RARE-/233138306657", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Eagle Pass, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331383066578080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIwWDQxOA==/z/12gAAOSwnM1ca09U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIwWDQxMg==/z/z2YAAOSw4S1ca09V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDEyWDYyMA==/z/psEAAOSw~jJca09U/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTI4WDM0Ng==/z/ZmwAAOSwOc5ca09T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDIwWDYyMA==/z/MrIAAOSwYnhca09W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjIwWDQ1Mw==/z/W7UAAOSw2Nhca09W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RkAAAOSwHF5ca09Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "78852", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "joeblack112", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 742, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 20, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1275.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 5}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE", "UY"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Billie Joe Armstrong Les Paul Jr Gibson White (VERY RARE)", "HitCount": 843, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1300.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
