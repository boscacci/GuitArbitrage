What makes this guitar special: The Ace Frehley \u201cBudokan\u201d Les Paul Custom is crafted with the traditional ingredients of the Les Paul Custom circa the early to mid-1970s. Its carved Grade-A maple top is joined to a Grade-A mahogany body that is weight relieved to reduce the load and enhance resonance. This classic tonewood pairing gives you the blend of maple\u2019s snap and articulation with mahogany\u2019s depth and warmth, cornerstones of the legendary Les Paul sound. Loaded with three period-correct, double-cream DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups for maximum rhythm crunch and lead tones of unparalleled fire and fury. To maximize the sonic versatility of the traditional three-way toggle switch and four-knob control section, the guitar is wired to select the neck pickup alone in the switch\u2019s upper position, both middle and bridge pickups in the middle position (sharing the lower volume and tone controls), and bridge pickup alone in the lower position. Neck: The quarter-sawn mahogany neck is carved to a traditional slim, yet rounded, profile with cream binding & black side-dots. Richlite fingerboard with white acrylic block inlays. Bound headstock with mother of pearl split diamond inlay. Grover tuners with pearloid banjo buttons. 1 11/16\" nut width; 24 3/4\" scale length. Body: Solid mahogany body & maple top with 7-ply binding. Stopbar tailpiece & Tune-O-Matic bridge with chrome hardware. Single-ply cream pickguard & chrome jackplate. Pickups: Open Coil, DiMarzio Super Distortion (Ceramic) humbuckers with cream bezels. Dual volume & tone controls with gold speed knobs; 3-way toggle switch. 9.25% sales tax for Tennessee residents", "ItemID": "132960438398", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T01:23:31.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-20T17:13:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Ace-Frehley-Budokan-Les-Paul-Custom-Electric-Guitar-2012-Cherry-Sunburst-/132960438398", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Nashville, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329604383988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIxOVgxNjAw/z/cIsAAOSw5E1cbYd2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODM2WDE2MDA=/z/13kAAOSw3k9cbYdv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MTE=/z/qHsAAOSwVblcbYd7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMxOVgxNjAw/z/18IAAOSw3k9cbYeT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzg4WDE2MDA=/z/7k8AAOSwxy5cbYds/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3NVgxNjAw/z/f6EAAOSwndBcbYeM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Yw0AAOSw4AJcbYeG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MDc=/z/3v0AAOSwb~5cbYd~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYw/z/TIoAAOSw3CdcbYej/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyOFgxNjAw/z/MU0AAOSwEbxcbYed/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4NVgxNjAw/z/BecAAOSwOylcbYeX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTYzWDE2MDA=/z/~98AAOSwdZJcbYel/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "37221", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "guitarsdrums4u", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3890, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "-***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 679}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Ace Frehley Budokan Les Paul Custom Electric Guitar*2012*Cherry Sunburst", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Ace Frehley Budokan Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2012"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 102, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=206736481", "StoreName": "GuitarsDrums4u"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Seller", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "TopRatedListing": true, "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Guitar is fully functional with no issues.
