{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a 2015 Gibson Memphis 1952 ES-295 in a beautiful Sixties Cherry with the original case and certificate of authenticity. This guitar is in excellent condition and in perfect working order. There are some light scratches, a couple dings, and a small surface crack on the top layer of the cutaway. This is pretty common and is supported by the block so it's not going to spread. Overall, I would give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 condition. Everything on the guitar is original. The neck is straight with no issues. The original frets are in excellent condition with no wear. The original case is in excellent condition and works great.
