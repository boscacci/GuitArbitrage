{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "NEW YEAR'S SALE PRICE $200 OFF If you are looking for one of these, the older ones are quite a bit harder to find and in my (honest) opinion of higher quality! My sale price includes a 30-day return privilege and the guitar comes in a perfect-fitting gig bag. Beautiful book-matched flame maple top with tight figure and tremendous 3-D depth. Very striking tortoise binding and an unbound soundhole that really shows off the flame maple. The AC features a one-piece mahogany neck with through-the-body design. It's got an ebony slab fretboard with small dot inlays & 24 frets. Nice, slim neck profile for comfort. It strings through the body for maximum acoustic projection and sustain. The good news is it weighs a shade less than 5 1/2 lbs. The ebony bridge has a piezo pickup under the saddle matched to a custom 9-volt preamp. Controls include volume, bass & treble and all the hardware is gold-plated. That includes the deluxe set of Sperzel locking tuners which all tighten snugly as they should. Plugged in it still retains an open, airy tone but can rock out if necessary. I have standard electric strings on it but a pro player will want to experiment with different gauges and/or alloys to get maximum performance out of the guitar. Good news; the only fret wear of note is on the first 3 frets under the G-string and (to a much lesser degree) the B and E-strings. The rest of the frets are nice & clean and above the 5th fret, they are virtually unplayed. The guitar is by no means in mint condition. It's been well-played with its share of dings, a 3/4\" side bump, scuffs & scratches but there is no damage or serious buckle wear. It's simply a player's guitar! I've got the action set reasonably low and have taken time to make sure the neck and truss rod are stable. But playing styles vary and if this guitar is not for you, simply contact me if you want to send it back. $30 USA SHIPPING and a 30-day return privilege if you are not satisfied for any reason.", "ItemID": "323638132345", "EndTime": "2019-01-11T17:34:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T00:50:48.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1990s-USA-CARVIN-AC-175-THIN-HOLLOW-BODY-A-E-GUITAR-FLAME-MAPLE-MAHOGANY-SUPER-/323638132345", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Scranton, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236381323458080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MFgxNjAw/z/XHIAAOSwR0dcHq3u/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NTY=/z/hI8AAOSwVXdcHq3X/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1MjY=/z/PIQAAOSwUpFcHq3n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI3MlgxNjAw/z/hhMAAOSwCXxcHq3z/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzgwWDE2MDA=/z/MGYAAOSwUWtcHq4A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzU5WDE2MDA=/z/SeUAAOSwsPNcHq4F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AYAAAOSwAx9cJ3d7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3rUAAOSwAVlcJ3eA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/F-EAAOSwT5tcJ3eC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzI2WDE2MDA=/z/AtIAAOSwfTlcJ3eF/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "18508", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "bassrmh", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2087, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 489.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 489.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 5475}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1990s USA CARVIN AC-175 THIN HOLLOW BODY A/E GUITAR FLAME MAPLE MAHOGANY, SUPER!", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model", "Value": ["AC-175"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990's"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Thinline"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Natural flame maple"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Single Cut", "Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["USA Carvin"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Acoustic Thinline"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple", "Flame maple top/mahogany body"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 284, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1060888262", "StoreName": "bassrmh"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "normal player wear, some marks typical of a 25+ year old guitar", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
