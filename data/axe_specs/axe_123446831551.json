{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for auction, this heavily modified USA Gibson Les Paul Junior converted to a Special with neck pickup. I think it is a 1986 model.The pickups are a Seymour Duncan soap bar in the neck and a British P90 style Bareknuckle humbucker in the bridge. The switching occurs using a push/pull pot in the volume knob, eliminates extra routes needed to install an external toggle switch. The routing for the neck pickup and slight deepening of the bridge pickup hole for the bridge pickup were done professionally by a qualified luthier.The neck has been professionally stripped of its finish on the back and treated with tung oil and it feels awesome. No breaks at the headstock or other worrisome neck joint stuff. The tuners were replaced a long time ago with Grover tuning pegs.It has strap locks. It is covered in playwear and bumps and scrapes and dents from years of honest playing and cuffs and buckles and rivets from jeans. Not intentionally \u201crelic\u201ded, it got the scars from being a darn good guitar being bumped around on stages and in jam sessions.It comes with a snug fitting shaped hard generic case made by Yorkville. Please ask lots of questions if you have them. I can't falsify values for duty or customs reasons so please don't ask me to do so.I only accept paypal unless you are buying it locally and picking it up in person.Buyers will pay exact shipping so email for a quote before paying please. I haven't boxed it up yet just in case it sells because I love this guitar. I can't keep them all though, so its time for someone else to enjoy it. The opening price is close to what I spent on the pickups, wiring, and case. Add a great American made Gibson guitar and you've got a rock solid, one of a kind guitar. I am a huge fan of the late/great Chris Whitley and built this guitar loosely mimic one of his. I have it for sale locally too. Bid early so I know there is interest out there.", "ItemID": "123446831551", "EndTime": "2018-10-31T04:22:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-24T04:22:20.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Gibson-Les-Paul-Junior-Special-conversion-1986-Duncan-and-Bareknuckle-pickups-/123446831551", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Winnipeg, Manitoba", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1234468315518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RGMAAOSwty5bxh79/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sNwAAOSwnhJbxh78/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/K4wAAOSw38Vbxh74/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pPgAAOSw~4hbxh74/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UxYAAOSwF2Fbxh73/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tFAAAOSwhBhbxh77/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LAAAAOSwuZpbxh79/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/g40AAOSwjBVbxh79/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/y-kAAOSw8U9bxh76/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GXcAAOSwPR9bxh73/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jrEAAOSwVx5bxh77/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/iE8AAOSwr3xbxh76/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "R3X 0L6", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "telebjorn", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 191, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 459.31, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 609.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***p", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 131}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["CA", "US"], "Site": "Canada", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Gibson Les Paul Junior Special conversion 1986 \u00a0Duncan and Bareknuckle pickups", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1986"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Junior Special"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 461, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "CA", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 619.0, "CurrencyID": "CAD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
