{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Lovely rare old Japanese made OM/Folk size guitar for your pleasure\u2026.. These guitars were exported from Japan to the UK from the early 70's\u2026.. Branded 'Saxon' and made for Henri Selmer of London, this one was most likely crafted in the world famous Matsumoku facility, Nagoya, Japan. Here in the afterlife, we have repaired, owned and played many of these so called 'lawsuit' Japanese copy guitars and they are very well made with decent tone woods used, even the laminates used are of very high quality compared with how they are today.Pay no real heed to the model number, as they tended to use the same numbers for completely unrelated guitars! Japanese sense of humour I guess! What is reliable is that this is a good quality Martin copy at the affordable end of the spectrum, at around ten times less than an original, she's a respectable option certainly. These Japanese vintages are generally superior to todays products, value steadily increasing too, hence good to own.The tone and volume are very pleasing on this example with a well balanced mature timbre with a surprising amount of edge to it for the body size, the playing action is easy going and can be lowered further if required - there is a good couple of mil left on the saddle. We have lightly restored and fully set up this lovely guitar, fitted with very nice UK made phosphor bronze light gauge strings.The structure is very good, spruce, rosewood and mahogany construction with a true straight neck and no distortion of the soundboard.The neck has a medium 'V' profile and combined with the narrow 43mm nut, this makes for comfortable handling even for those of us with smaller handspans. Cosmetically there are just light traces of honest use described in photo's, it has been described as excellent because the overall appearance is superb for the age, she's been played with discretion and care hence the condition is commensurate with a 40 year vintage guitar that has been played. Ms Saxon is waiting! Enjoy!!
