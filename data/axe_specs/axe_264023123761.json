{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "About the ESP Phoenix II Guitar; These are rare, and only made for 2 years. This is 100% original, except for the strapholders, which had Dimarzio straplocks when I acquired it. Replaced with original chrome Stock style. Seymour Duncan JB and Jazz pickup set, stock. Gotoh Magnum locking tuners, stock. Tune-o-matic style bridge and tailpiece, again, stock. Bound fretboard, with no visible wear on the frets. Typical U shaped ESP neck that has a stock satin finish on the back of the neck, and plays like butter. Neck Through Body, reverse headstock, and plays as good as, if not better then any Firebird I have ever played. About THIS ESP Phoenix; in 2006 I was playing Gibson Firebirds. They were not made to withstand the beatings I would give it on tour, and the replacement pick-ups never sounded right. On tour in Japan, my Gibson was falling apart and an ESP rep was there to help rebuild it. I asked if ESP still did a Firebird shape as they had in the past. They didn't still make them, but he had one in stock. I played it at that show that night and was hooked. I convinced ESP to make me a couple more but the US branch was reluctant. Till they saw mine in person. The original was a gold/green color and then they made 2 more; a black one and a white one. This is the white one that ended up going into production about 1 years later. It's got some scratches and dings on the back, but nothing to serious. The front is super clean and has the original Jack Skellington sticker on it, which can be removed very easily. The case is practically brand new. It comes with an 8x10 photo of me playing the guitar and a used guitar pick. Loads of history in this guitar, and if you don't care about that; it's just an awesome guitar. *will not ship until Nov 26*", "ItemID": "264023123761", "EndTime": "2018-11-11T15:09:12.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-04T15:09:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-Phoenix-II-Single-owner-Acey-Slade-Murderdolls-Dope-Joan-Jett-/264023123761", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Newark, New Jersey", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2640231237618080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/l1sAAOSwPDVb3wTM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/6EIAAOSwseZb3wSu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMwMFg4Njc=/z/ZXYAAOSw6gdb3wSu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMwMFg4Njc=/z/Nd0AAOSwL4tb3wSv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/4GgAAOSwCPZb3wSv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/SAIAAOSwcrZb3wSv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/WLQAAOSwxxVb3wSu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/OyAAAOSw7Spb3wSu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/NhoAAOSwF8Fb3wSu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/tCYAAOSw3zFb3wSv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/0Y4AAOSw-FNb3wSw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODY3WDEzMDA=/z/ldwAAOSwdUJb3wSv/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "07105", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "aceyslademusic69", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 86, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 49}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP Phoenix II Single owner; Acey Slade of the Murderdolls, Dope, Joan Jett\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Phoenix"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 913, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 1225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
