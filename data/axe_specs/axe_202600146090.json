{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Desolation DC-1 ST Trans Black **Any winning bids over $325.00 will come with a like new Road Runner case. All other bids will have the guitar shipped in a standard cardboard guitar box.** Guitar is hardly played and is in perfect working order. Two dings on the back(see pics). Small thin scratch on back of body that's only visible in the right light, and a few tiny scratches on the neck. The top is beautiful and clean.I removed the active EMG pickups and put in some GFS Dream 180 Humbuckers. The volume knobs are push/pull which puts the pickups in single coil operation when pulled up. No tone pot installed. These pickups sound great.Guitar plays perfectly and sounds awesome.Following is a description and the specs of the guitar:The Desolation DC-1 ST has a double-cutaway mahogany body with a carved top and neck-through-body design.
