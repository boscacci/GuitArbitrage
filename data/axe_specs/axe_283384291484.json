{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale here we have a Peavey Nitro 1 Electric Guitar. So, as you can see the original owner won this guitar. He was one of 5 grand prizes winners in the Mylon and Broken Heart \"Great Guitar Giveaway\" that was sponsored by Peavey. This guitar was strung and only played one time (you can tell, we thought it was new old stock until we found out it was played once). It has been stored in a climate controlled storage unit since 1990. Everything is super clean and in mint condition. We had it checked out by a local guitar shop and they too thought it had never been played, lol. Needless to say neck, body, everything pretty much looks perfect. The plastic is still on the back of the panels, we will let the buyer remove those upon receiving. Everything you see in the photos is included. This is a great piece for a collector we imagine due to condition and everything included. Please view all photos for a better view at contents and condition. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. \u201cOur return policy is the following: We have a 30 day return policy if any item is not described accurately by both written description and photos.
