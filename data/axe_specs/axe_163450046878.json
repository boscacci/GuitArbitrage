{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Selling a Jackson Chris Broderick signature Soloist 7 string guitar. An absolute beast of an extended range guitar, with tons of awesome features for the modern player. One-piece mahogany neck thru design with mahogany wings offers plenty of sustain and a very balanced tone. Rosewood fretboard with 24 jumbo frets is easy to play, with killer fret access all the way up the neck. The DiMarzio CB7 pickups are killer and contribute to this guitar\u2019s massive sound. The neck pickup offers a \u201cround\u201d sound that remains articulate even under high gain. The bridge pickup is punchy and aggressive, and brings a lot of attack to the low B string. Combined with a 3-way toggle, coil split on the push-pull volume pot, tone bypass on the push-pull tone pot, and a killswitch, there\u2019s plenty of versatility for anything you could play. A Floyd Rose Special bridge rounds out the guitar, keeping tune during even the sickest whammy tricks. This guitar is great, and I\u2019d love to keep it, but the holidays did a number on my finances, so I need to recup somewhere. (One less guitar around also keeps the missus happy.) Any questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Many thanks!", "ItemID": "163450046878", "EndTime": "2018-12-28T21:18:24.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-25T06:32:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Jackson-Chris-Broderick-Pro-Series-Soloist-7-String-White-DiMarzio-Shredder-/163450046878", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1634500468788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WdMAAOSwRYNcIczh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8IIAAOSwuZVcIczi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mIsAAOSwDX5cIczd/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8rkAAOSwjoFcIczZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pNIAAOSwD1pcIczz/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LwsAAOSwI9FcIcy-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/330AAOSwy3JcIczk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-uYAAOSwvERcIczl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "46268", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "awin3256", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 84, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 97.6}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 400.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "b***x", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 577}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Jackson Chris Broderick Pro Series Soloist 7 String White DiMarzio Shredder", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Jackson"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 117, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
