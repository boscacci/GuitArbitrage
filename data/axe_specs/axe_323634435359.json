{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Here is a nice 2015 Gibson ES-335 guitar in practically near mint condition. Never been gigged with, just played with in the house. It has been seldom used; I\u2019ve done my best to keep it in the best condition I can. Willing to look at offers, but don\u2019t lowball me. That being said, the guitar sounds fantastic. The neck is smooth, the pickups sound great, and it has a nice full sound to it. These guitars cost $2700 new... and I\u2019m selling mine for much less. Unfortunately, when I bought this guitar, guitar center didn\u2019t have the right case for it. So instead, they provided an epiphone hard case - the case that will be included in this listing. Thanks for looking! If you have any questions, just ask! I\u2019d be glad to answer them to the best of my ability. Sorry, I\u2019m shipping to the United States only on this guitar.", "ItemID": "323634435359", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T20:45:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-04T04:01:13.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2015-Gibson-ES-335-Block-Memphis-Semi-Acoustic-Electric-Guitar-Satin-Cherry-/323634435359", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Cumberland Foreside, Maine", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236344353598080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KqIAAOSwI9FcLtbf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/itgAAOSwNqxcLtbk/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cicAAOSwCCRcLtbg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lsUAAOSwIbtcLtbl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/UsIAAOSwFAtcLtbi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "04110", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "theclaw67", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 82, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1699.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 101}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2015 Gibson ES-335 Block Memphis Semi-Acoustic Electric Guitar Satin Cherry", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}]}, "HitCount": 652, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
