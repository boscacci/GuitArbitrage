{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a great looking and most importantly a great sounding guitar. The 57 Classic Pickups are one of the best features of the Guitar. With it's Mahogany Maple Body and a Brass Zero Fret Nut you are going to enjoy the clean sound of this guitar. But if you don't like it too clean, you have coil splitting and tone controls to shake things up a bit. The tuned coil taps are another nice feature. A Wine Red Body with trapezoid pearl inlays not only brings comfort but also style. Celebrating Les Paul's 100th Birthday, the back of this guitar's neck features a hologram sticker with a 3D picture of Les and 100 years blazoned over him. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the redesigned G-Force tuning system. It is a great feature. No more holding up the band while you're fiddling around trying to get that Drop D tuning. WIth 4 presets of Dropped, Altered and Open Tuning, with the touch of a button watch the robot spinners give you the exact tuning you need. You can also customize the tuning in many different ways and save it to the G-Force System. G Force comes with a Charger, but the rechargeable battery lasts for hours with absolutely no need to worry about it running down during a show, or two or three shows for that matter.. With a 57 Plus Bridge, this 57 classic design is sure to impress. I hate to get rid of this beauty, she is a great guitar. The only reason I am getting rid of her is because I am a piano player first and foremost. I just don't have the time or the patience to learn a new instrument.
