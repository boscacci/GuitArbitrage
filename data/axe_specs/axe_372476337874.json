{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fender Custom Shop For over 30 years the extraordinarily talented luthiers of the Fender Custom Shop have been providing the most illustrious guitar players of their day with their dream instruments. For guitarists who must have the instrument's original-era tone, look and feel, the '50s Telecaster epitomizes the guitar in the decade of its debut, with unmistakable early Tele style and snap. With its authentic vintage-style features and finish, everything about it takes you back to the time of diners, \"Ike for President,\" cars with fins, two-stepping western swing, a wild new kind of music called rock 'n' roll, and an upstart little Southern California company called Fender. This Telecaster boasts a lightweight roasted Ash body & Roasted Birdseye maple neck/fretboard, feeling comfortable to play for long hours at any late night gig. The appointments alone make this a stand out guitar, the Wide Chocolate Burst w/ Aged Closet Classic relic has a classic 50's look that will have people talking about the guitar for hours. Behind the appointments is Fender's classic tone, built into a Texas Special Neck pickup paired with a 51 Nocaster pickup in the bridge. The neck is a 10/56 V shape that fits perfectly for lead solo's or chunky rhythm. This Guitar includes a Tweed Fender Hardcase with a Cable, Certificate of Authenticity, and an Ashtray Cover. This Pre-Owned Guitar is in Very Good Condition and has been \"Closet Classic\" Relic'd.
