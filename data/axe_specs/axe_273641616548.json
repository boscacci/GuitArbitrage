{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is an excellent condition 2011 G&L Legacy USA! I play drums primarily, so this guitar has seen very little play. It sounds and plays exactly as you would expect a USA made legacy to, fantastic! There are no dead frets or issues with the fretboard in general. Electronics are all working as they should. It's in great shape! The guitar comes equipped with satin chrome Schaller locking tuners and gold Schaller strap locks with a nylon black Ernie Ball strap. It also comes with the original tuner pegs and the tremolo bar. Everything should be pictured.
