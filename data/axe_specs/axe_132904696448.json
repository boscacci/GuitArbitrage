{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Tobacco Burst Music Man Axis Super Sport. This guitar was manufactured in 2002 in San Luis Obispo, California. The condition is excellent with normal wear and a tiny little dinger on the top of the headstock (See photo.. I'm still crying over this..). Sounds and plays amazing as you would expect from a MM guitar. Neck is perfect with light fret wear. Comes with original hard shell case, and DOES NOT include the tremelo bar. Case is functionally perfect but is looking a little ugly do to the good work it has done.. :) This guitar is simply one of the best sounding and playing guitars I have ever owned.
