{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage HONDO Formula 1 Series - H762CS Sunburst Cherry Electric Guitar. 1984. This auction is for a cool cherry red sunburst vintage Hondo guitar known as the Formula 1 Series H-762. It was introduced in 1984 as Hondo's Ibanez Roadstar RS1000 copy, one of the first two models in the Formula 1 Series. Because of what an accurate copy it is, it is often mistakenly believed to have been made by Ibanez (or that the Ibanez was made by Samick; also not true). This body was later used for the Samick I model. Lots of images on Google with Gary Moore playing an Ibanez Rockstar. This guitar has been with me from new (35 years) & has spent most of it's life hanging on my wall. It is in superb vintage condition & I will be very sad to see this fabulous 80's guitar go. Solid ash 3 piece body, Grover Rotomatic tuners as standard & it also retains all it's original manufacture inspection & model number foil stickers ( A LITTLE GEM ). The guitar has a beautiful & easy to play bolt on maple C shape neck. The guitar is in excellent condition with only one or two very minor surface scuffs & one very small surface lacquer dink to front top left of body (really very minor). NO saddle, neck, hardware or fret buzzing issues & all electrics function well. Minor gold plating loss to hardware & one split to neck pickup cream plastic surround, minor pitting to neck plate surface. It comes with a full set of tuned medium weight steel strings so ready to go. These guitars are very well made with lots of quality features & are now fast becoming an invest piece. Overall a fantastic condition mid 80's vintage electric guitar . . .
