{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Thank you for visiting our Ebay store. This is a Super Rare 2001 Parker USA Fly SSH model guitar in what's believed to be Arctic Silver Finish. This an important year as it was part of the Ken Parker years. This is a fine instrument that is in Good Overall condition and shows normal playing wear for a seventeen year old guitar. This particular model has two Dimarzio Single Coils and a Dimarzio Humbucker in the bridge, all of which were custom wound for this model. Also features stainless steel frets, and piezo. Includes OHSC and tremolo bar as shown. You will not be disappointed as this guitar plays and sounds like a dream! When you buy from me, expect to receive what you see in the pics. I know the feeling of buying something sight unseen only to find out the seller was not that accurate. I have been selling on Ebay for more than a decade and I am only happy when you are happy! Buyer has 24 hours to contact me and 3 days to complete payment transaction. If this criteria is not met, the item will be sold to someone else. Please keep in mind with shipping, when you buy a guitar from me, you are not just paying for shipping. You are paying for my time and experience in packaging delicate items, as well as the cost of new boxes and shipping peanuts. Thanks. Please email me with any questions and good luck in bidding!", "ItemID": "332988567124", "EndTime": "2019-01-01T19:01:33.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-01T00:45:37.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Super-Rare-Parker-Fly-USA-SSH-Model-Silver-/332988567124", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pompano Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3329885671248080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/H9oAAOSwtvZcKrZu/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/ZdwAAOSw8zNcKrZx/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DhsAAOSwRs5cKrZ1/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/GQgAAOSwyPFcKrZ3/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/iPsAAOSwSidcKrZ6/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/FgQAAOSwm~1cKraV/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/eeMAAOSwNphcKraX/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/FgwAAOSwm~1cKrac/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/CKIAAOSwOWdcKrag/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/qrsAAOSwQGFcKraj/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/3gQAAOSwAmJcKrao/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/apQAAOSwQ5pcKrn4/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33065", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "spinesplitter", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1613, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1799.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 136}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Super Rare Parker Fly USA SSH Model Silver", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Country of Manufacture", "Value": ["USA"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Parker"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2001"]}]}, "HitCount": 52, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=11691455", "StoreName": "Hear For Music"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
