{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Thanks for viewing my listing! This is an early 70s (likely 71 or 72) Gibson SG - I purchased this guitar several years ago for the pickups by my guitar project days are over. The pickups are the rare \"embossed Gibson logo\" patent sticker version. Resistance measurements are shown. The guitar is a rare bird - it's got the controls of a special but humbuckers like a deluxe - I've only seen one other factory SG with humbuckers that has only single volume/tone controls. If you have any info on this guitar I can add it here. When strung up it plays fine - but as can be seen someone hacked the top of the trussrod. I haven't tried to adjust it, relief seemed within spec many years ago but assume the guitar will need some work here. Pots were replaced but all of the other electronics look original, including the tophats. Someone installed a fender bridge as well of all things. Tuners were Klusons and now have two strips. Will play once strung up. However, the value here is in the pickups. They are original, unmolested and covers have not been removed. Includes what I believe are the original rings. I have more pictures, ask if you are interested for something in particular. Includes the hardshell case shown. Check my feedback, and bid with confidence!
