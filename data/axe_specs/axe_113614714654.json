{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Early 1960s Imperial hollowbody guitar, made by Fuji Gen Gakki in Matsumoto City, Japan. In remarkably good condition for it's age. No major dings, dents or breaks. Seems to have been played very little. Straight neck, adjustable truss rod, and the frets are in very good shape as well. All electronics work. A good player, but could use a setup for best performance. Whammy bar has been missing for years, but replacements are easily obtainable online. $329, no case, but will be very well packed and shipped via FedEx or USPS in ConUSA. No overseas shipping. I have set shipping charge at $75, but if it's less, I will refund the buyer the difference less materials, as I'm not out to make a profit on shipping. I will consider reasonable offers, but please NO LOWBALLS. I am selling this for a friend, an older gentleman man who owns a small music store here in NJ. Ask any questions beforehand. I cannot hold this instrument, so please don't ask. I have a five star rating here, and a 100% positive rating on Ebay.
