{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "You're looking at a 1979 Fender 25th Silver Anniversary Stratocaster All Original including the hard case. Plays like a dream and has wear consistent with a 40 year old guitar that's been played. Various dings and scrapes but nothing unsightly or excessive. This is still a beautiful guitar as you can see in the pics. Almost no fret wear. Pretty deep rash on the back. No issues, modifications or repairs. If you're looking for a collector piece or closet queen, this ain't it. If you want a rare, killer guitar you found it. I have a personal luthier who works on all of my guitars and he has this guitar playing beautifully. I guarantee it's the best playing Anniversary Stratocaster available. Please ask any and all questions you may have before purchasing. Shipping to anywhere in the Continental USA will be a flat $25 Thanks for looking", "ItemID": "132934029899", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T12:51:04.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T11:41:23.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1979-Fender-25th-Silver-Anniversary-Stratocaster-All-Original-/132934029899", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Swartz Creek, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1329340298998080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTQxWDgwMA==/z/33wAAOSw3-9cUDk9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/w~YAAOSwzFhcUDkt/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDM0OA==/z/AMwAAOSwQqNcUDky/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDM3NQ==/z/JyQAAOSw6X1cUDlI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzIyWDgwMA==/z/wwwAAOSwDsZcUDlC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/cKAAAOSwpW5cUDlM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDgwMA==/z/WtUAAOSwYTtcUDlA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODAwWDY4Mg==/z/HFUAAOSwqLlcUDk1/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTM1WDgwMA==/z/aOMAAOSwckZcUDlG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzY4WDgwMA==/z/yoQAAOSwl7dcUDk6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDY5WDgwMA==/z/YlcAAOSwvpVcUDlL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDU3WDgwMA==/z/-88AAOSwTxJcUDlP/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "48473", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "shnookyl", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 586, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***y", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 2}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1979 Fender 25th Silver Anniversary Stratocaster All Original ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Silver"]}]}, "HitCount": 557, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
