This is as close to an American made LP Custom Black Beauty as you can get... at a third the price. TOP QUALITY MATERIALS, PARTS and BUILD. This is an EPIPHONE (by GIBSON) Elitist Les Paul Custom electric guitar. BLACK BEAUTY! Made in the Fuji-gen factory, JAPAN, MIJ, in 2007. Serial number F7007xx. It comes with the hard shell case you see in the pictures. Also included are the case keys, neck wrench, warranty card and owners manual. 100% Original and Complete. This guitar is truly show room clean. The back of the neck is perfectly SMOOTH! The frets and finger board look NEW! Some pick marks on the pickguard. Looks like it has barely been played.

Professionally set up. Everything works as it should... electronics, truss rod, bridge, tuners, etc. I have serviced the guitar... cleaned and polished the neck and body, cleaned and conditioned the fingerboard, cleaned and polished the frets, installed new strings (DR 'TITE FIT' 10-46), adjusted bridge etc. She is ready to play and PLAYS GREAT!! Buyer pays $49.95 shipping, insurance, packaging and handling to contiguous 48 states. Items over 2 lbs will ship Fed Ex ground, (no PO Boxes). I purchased this guitar last year from a smoker. The guitar is fine. I have aired out the case, but if a light odor remains you may have to let it air out a few more weeks. If that bothers you I can ship the guitar without the case. Thanks for looking and good luck. The following is common sense stuff, but needs mentioned: -If you have a concern with any item purchased, CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY by phone or email. I always offer a full refund of the purchase amount. You should not have to live with something you are unhappy with for any reason. If you alter, modify, change or \"repair\" the item in anyway without my consent, you are accepting the item \"as is\", at the price paid. All items are packed for safety. Often requiring reassembly, tuning and/or adjusting. -If you receive an item that has been damaged in shipping, CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY and save all the packaging. We will work through the claim together until things are right. -I can ship almost anywhere, but free shipping or a fixed shipping price is for the contiguous 48 states ONLY. If you have a foreign address, use an APO, live in Alaska, Puerto Rico, etc., message me for a shipping price BEFORE you buy. Due to the cost and risk of shipping I do not accept returns from outside the US. Once the package is delivered to the carrier, the foreign buyer is responsible for the item, including but not limited to taxes, fees, customs issues, delays, damage, lose, duty, etc.", "ItemID": "202559318770", "EndTime": "2019-01-07T16:19:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T06:36:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEAR-MINT-07-EPIPHONE-LES-PAUL-CUSTOM-ELITIST-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-FUJIGEN-JAPAN-MIJ-/202559318770", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Victoria, Kansas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025593187708080_2.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/k00AAOSwaiBcMuoO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/AFkAAOSwPuRcMuoE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dXYAAOSwHGJcMuoV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/euwAAOSwHPdcMuoH/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jgQAAOSwXchcMuoR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/O1EAAOSws0pcMuoY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CZ4AAOSw3GlcMuob/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/q4wAAOSwMKFcMuoi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CoMAAOSwKOZcMuon/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uroAAOSw6X1cMuot/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/WGkAAOSwGD1cMuo0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "67671", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "kpfeifer", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2699, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 949.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 949.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***q", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 53}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "NEAR MINT '07 EPIPHONE LES PAUL CUSTOM ELITIST ELECTRIC GUITAR FUJIGEN JAPAN MIJ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Elitist Les Paul Custom"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Applicable Regions", "Value": ["Asian craftsmanship"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2007"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Listing", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Archtop"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Bundle Description", "Value": ["with case and case candy"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Series", "Value": ["ELITIST"]}]}, "HitCount": 50, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=2985304", "StoreName": "TAP MUSIC AND MORE"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "EXCEPTIONAL, NEAR MINT CONDITION.
