{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello ! Up for sale is a super terrific 6 string electric guitar by Epiphone.....the Les Paul Junior ! An excellent lower price point guitar with the classic Les Paul shape ! You can Google it or go to Zzounds.com, etc., etc, to find out the features of this versatile guitar. So I'm going to instead talk about what makes this a cool axe! First, this guitar has a great amount of sustain! It can really sing. Both the nut and the wraparound bridge have been lubricated with graphite, so the guitar stays in tune much easier now !!! The guitar has been strung with the strings wrapped around ON TOP of the bridge, which I love ! It makes guitars play so much better as far as the action goes, in my opinion ! Speaking of the action, it has also been lowered to the point where the guitar is very easy to play, but without any dead spots or ringing frets that I've found. All of this sound and playability for only $125 bucks! Get it now before someone else does! Please read the condition description, these listing details, and examine the pictures carefully. Thanks so much for your interest and I hope you buy it now!!!!", "ItemID": "153350505563", "EndTime": "2019-01-24T19:31:40.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-23T20:08:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Beautiful-Epiphone-Gibson-Les-Paul-Junior-Tobacco-Burst-Serviced-Low-action-/153350505563", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Mill, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533505055638080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3MjQ=/z/1ZIAAOSwuNNcSMQh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2NzE=/z/LX0AAOSwgCpcSMQ0/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzNVg4ODY=/z/6PoAAOSwF7lcSMRN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3MTE=/z/xowAAOSw-rxcSMRk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3MDY=/z/YTcAAOSwEfVcSMR1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMlg4ODI=/z/VvYAAOSw4b1cSMSJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExOVg4ODY=/z/sc8AAOSwpLdcSMSW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ4OFg4ODY=/z/ZLkAAOSwXINcSMSk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc5WDE1ODc=/z/ykEAAOSwJ3RcSMSy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk5WDE1ODc=/z/HFwAAOSwYX9cSMTG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29707", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "heavyspender", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3195, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 124.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 124.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***t", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 106}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "Asia", "AU", "NZ", "EG", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Beautiful Epiphone by Gibson Les Paul Junior.

Would be in excellent shape if not for several dings and dents in the body, especially on the front. However, they are not noticeable unless you are pretty much in playing distance from the guitar. (See pics.) No major chips in the paint. The guitar has been loved cosmetically back into very presentable shape as we have cleaned/buffed the body and back of the neck of the guitar with Clayton polish. And the fretboard was conditioned with really nice smelling lemon oil! Before shipping, strings will be cleaned with string cleaner, even though they are fairly new. And the process of cleaning the body and conditioning the fretboard will be repeated as necessary....so the lucky buyer can just plug her in and start rockin' out !!!!! Both strap buttons are intact and present !", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
