{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1977 Gibson Les Paul Standard Tobacco Sunburst Electric Guitar w/ OHSC Welcome! Right now, you are bidding on a great piece.This is the 1977 Gibson Les Paul Traditional!Featuring the classic Gibson wood combinations - mahogany body, maple top and a rosewood fingerboard. If you're looking for that classic Les Paul tone, this is where you need to be. No weight relief at all gives this guitar incredible warmth and sustain. You can feel it vibrating with every note, equating to the famous Les Paul mid-range push. Dual patented etched humbuckers grab that natural resonance and add their own mojo. The bridge pickup has just the right amount of bite with a full body backing it up. These pickups are very dynamically sensitive, lighting your attack and the pickups clean up nicely, lean in and these open right up. Like an extension of your playing - the way it should be. A true tone machine.This guitar is in great overall condition. It plays incredibly, and has some scratches/dings/dents - please see photos. These have no effect on the performance whatsoever.It weighs 9 lbs 10 oz. 24 1/2\" scale length, and 1.68\" nut width.This auction is for the 1977 Gibson Les Paul Standard, along with its original hardshell case. This is a no reserve auction, so bid to win. Good luck! **This is a 1977. The confusion about the serial number came from the (06) 185534. During the period from 1975-1977 Gibson used a transfer that had eight-digit numbers. The first two indicated the year. In this example, 06=1977. The following digits are between 100000 and 200000. Made In USA was also included on the transfer. This is being relisted after a non-paying bidder.I hope this clears up any confusion - thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "123641564711", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T01:50:38.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-12T01:50:38.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1977-Gibson-Les-Paul-Standard-Tobacco-Sunburst-Electric-Guitar-w-OHSC-/123641564711", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Plainview, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1236415647118080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAy/z/7XEAAOSwo61cYfrK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MzI=/z/Dw8AAOSw-hRcYfrb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTQ1WDE2MDA=/z/d9oAAOSw9ZtcYfrI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjA2/z/-cEAAOSw1YRcYfrO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTM=/z/d90AAOSw9ZtcYfrM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDQ5/z/iFgAAOSw~6hcYfrP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzA2/z/IcUAAOSwHcdcYfrS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjY5WDE2MDA=/z/qIsAAOSw81lcYfrT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MDg=/z/p44AAOSwz4xcYfrV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nvMAAOSwOc5cYfrX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzgxWDE2MDA=/z/KwwAAOSwqiRcYfrZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11803", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "wolfnsx", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2088, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 52, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2224.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2224.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 458}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1977 Gibson Les Paul Standard Tobacco Sunburst Electric Guitar w/ OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Tobacco Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Exact Year", "Value": ["1977"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1977"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Volume Knob", "With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "California Prop 65 Warning", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 1481, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=3227610", "StoreName": "Tagmasters"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2249.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good condition.
