{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Guitar w/ Caseitem # 201818298-LBNG-?????? This guitar seems to play fine but that is about all the good one could say ! Looks like the poster child for road worn. I could not tell You about what all has been changed over the years, not really an expert on these. There are no serial numbers to be found on the guitar, was told it is probably mid 70's when they used decals. The physical condition is obvious in the many pictures I am putting up. The cover plate on the back only has one screw that is actually not stripped out (close though & one wrong size) Came with tape over them, leaving here with new tape over them. The pots are marked 1377535 - 70-034 (the 3 I could read) was told these came back to 1975, verify for Yourself please. This guitar weighs in at 10 lbs. 10 oz. on My freight scale.
