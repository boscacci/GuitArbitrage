{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I do not mean to sound harsh but this is the 3rd time I've listed this guitar. The previous 2 winning bidders both refused to pay. If you don't have the funds to make prompt payment...PLEASE. DON'T. BID. This is a wonderful, mid to late-90's, USA-made Carvin Kiesel DC127 in exceptionally nice condition. Alder body with maple neck and ebony 24 fret fretboard. Features neck-thru construction for a solid feel and exceptional sustain. The stock Carvin pickups have been replaced with Tyson Tone Lab's Precious and Grace PAF humbuckers (these are list priced at $325/set). The neck is perfectly straight and frets show very little if any wear. Sperzel locking tuners. Volume and tone knobs, pickup selector switch, and coil tap switches for each humbucker. Almost new Ernie Ball Super Slinkies. There are only 3 very, very small flaws in the finish, all on the back bottom edge as shown in the photos. This is a beautiful guitar with exceptional tone. You will not be disappointed. It has never been gigged with and has never left my home in the years I've owned it. I simply have now collected far too many guitars (this Carvin, an acoustic, a Gibson, 2 Strats + a strat project,, a Taylor and a Schecter). Some will have to go and it's truly not an easy choice which to sell. I am reluctantly listing this Carvin and one of my Strats, and likely the Gibson soon to follow. The case shown in the photo is NOT included.", "ItemID": "323607652834", "EndTime": "2018-12-28T22:29:06.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-18T22:29:06.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/MID-90S-CARVIN-DC127-FERRARI-RED-TYSON-TONE-LAB-HUMBUCKERS-/323607652834", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Georgetown, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3236076528348080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pkcAAOSwyUtbiy0b/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/e1MAAOSwn6Rbiy0k/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ss4AAOSw-cFbiy1K/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/4fQAAOSwvuhbiy1X/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hD0AAOSwh49biy1g/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uqoAAOSw4axbiy1p/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kMYAAOSwFWdbiy10/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zB0AAOSwAnlbiy2I/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xUcAAOSw0INbiy27/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1HIAAOSwdudbiy3F/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/TZMAAOSw0c9biy3H/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DfUAAOSwyGhbizkz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "40324", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "steve4630", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 572, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 465.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 465.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***d", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 816}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "MID 90'S CARVIN DC127 FERRARI RED WITH TYSON TONE LAB HUMBUCKERS", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Carvin"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["DC127"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["With Pickup"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 250, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 470.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
