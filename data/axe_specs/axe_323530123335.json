{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Red Fender FMT Telecaster with two humbuckers. Seymour Duncan JB pickup in bridge position and a Seymour Duncan '59 in neck position. Usually, these guitars come stock with a Pearly Gates in the bridge but the JB really makes this guitar sing! Neck through body construction (NOT a bolt on neck).An Earvana compensated nut has been installed which really helps the intonation. The mini toggle switch is a series/parallel switch for the bridge pickup. The tone knob has a pull out series/parallel switch for the neck pick up. I've put tape over the edge of the bridge pickup to prevent the high E string from getting stuck under the pickup bobbin. There's also a pick holder next to the tone knob that is secured on by some double-sided tape. As you can see in the pics, there are some scratches (mostly on the back.....\"buckle rash\") and a \"ding\" by the control plate. Frets are in pretty good condition (see pic). It currently has D'Addario EXL 140 strings on it (light top, heavy bottom). Also comes with a fender strap and a used gig bag that shows some wear but is in OK condition. Email me with any questions. Thanks!", "ItemID": "323530123335", "EndTime": "2018-11-03T08:06:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-03T01:30:52.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Telecaster-FMT-HH-Electric-Guitar-/323530123335", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "El Segundo, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3235301233358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1MTU=/z/k6gAAOSwwZxb2-zB/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7wkAAOSwXbFb2-zF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4Mzg=/z/994AAOSwXOhb2-zD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/CZgAAOSw7rlb2-zG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/blgAAOSwfcNb2-zF/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/gSYAAOSwU1Nb2-zE/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/SqIAAOSwnJtb2-zI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TsoAAOSwufpb2-zH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/od4AAOSwZKJb2-zJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/S-cAAOSw-eJb2-zJ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3pMAAOSwlxxb2~AD/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90245", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "jt64844", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 74, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 346.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 346.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 225}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Telecaster FMT HH Electric Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Red"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["262000520"]}]}, "HitCount": 42, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 351.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78630459", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
