{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Relisted due to error in ad. Ebay automatically added product details for an SE245 which are incorrect. This is NOT an import, this is an American made single cut 245 with a 24.5 inch scale, outline birds on the fretboard, stoptail bridge, mahogany neck and body with a beautiful maple top that has some nice quilting. SN 09 14554. Sorry for the confusion. Paul Reed Smith SC245 American made, way cool!. Used. Never seen another one like this. Bought this years ago from a dealer and had never seen this color before so I called PRS. What they told me is that the color might be a custom order or limited run. SN matched the exact description of the guitar. Overall it is in great shape, no chips or gouges but it does have some surface marks and a few tiny dings and could probably use a buffing. Plays like butter and sounds amazing. Hardshell case in excellent condition. Shipping is fixed $60 and I will insure it for full sale value. Ships to CONUS only.
