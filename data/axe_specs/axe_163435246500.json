It started as a fanboy suggestion, based on the growing popularity of Alnico 8 magnets and the affinity for the Parallel Axis design. Coming out a year before the Alternative 8, the Crazy 8 has been advertised as the first Duncan pickup with an Alnico 8 magnet. Now, the Alnico 8 had a phase of being the go-to solution for many of the tone sniffers that dive deep in to modding pickups. They cram an Alnico 8 into an existing product, generally the Duncan Custom, and make their way up to Pride Rock for all to behold.
