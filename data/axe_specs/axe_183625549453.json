{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "****** Scroll down for 55 High Definition images ****** Here's a 2004 Gibson Les Paul Custom Shop Slash Signature #268 with the factory piezo bridge. This guitar is all original and has light aftermarket playwear. The frets are in excellent condition and don't have any grooves. The top is very clean with a few light indents - the back has some light indents and a few light scratches - see pics. There are no breaks, repairs or mods. It's a well cared for guitar that was played lightly at home. Here's the details -- The magic and power of the Slash Les Paul Signature model from Gibson Custom is in the details. With the goal of making both a classic and versatile Les Paul, Slash and Gibson Custom have created one of the most resourceful \u2014 and beautiful \u2014 Les Pauls ever. \"It's exactly the way I like my guitars set up, with the thin neck, the Seymour Duncan Alnico II pickups, the old classic hardware, everything,\" Slash says. The Slash Les Paul Signature Les Paul model focuses on function as much as beauty, but starts with one of the Les Paul\u2019s most traditional features: a hand-carved figured maple cap fitted onto a solid mahogany back. The standard one-piece mahogany neck is topped with a 22-fret bound rosewood fingerboard with a long neck tenon similar to the Les Pauls of the late 1950s, which extends well into the body pickup cavity, resulting in more wood-to-wood contact and overall strengthening of the guitar. The neck profile is also modeled from the necks on Slash's original Les Pauls. Slash's Personal Choice of Pickups The Slash Les Paul Signature model features two Seymour Duncan Alnico Pro II humbucker pickups, which are the same exact pickups that power each one of Slash\u2019s personal Les Pauls. They are open-coil humbuckers made to Slash\u2019s specs, and powerfully deliver the deep crunch and singing leads he\u2019s famous for. Fishman\u2019s Powerbridge pickup system unleashes the natural acoustic potential of this Les Paul, offering players an incredible selection of acoustic and hybrid acoustic/electric sounds with a special three-position mini-toggle switch inserted between the guitar\u2019s two volume control knobs to help regulate it. Rather than changing the natural tone of the Les Paul, the Powerbridge acts as an additional pickup that can be used on its own or blended with the Alnico II Pros to create an entirely new category of sound. Comes with the Gibson hardshell case and Certificate of Authenticity as seen in the pictures. This guitar will be safely packed and shipped.
