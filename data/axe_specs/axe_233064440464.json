If you missed out on the last one I sold for $800.00 well your in luck cause I have another one. This 2009 ESP LTD EC-CZ Clockwork Zombie is number 211 of 900 made and comes with the Certificate of Authenticity and is in Good Condition with one visibility Chip pictures. How you see it is exactly how you will get it. NO CASE WITH THIS ONE There is a large sticker on the front and 1 smaller one on the back. A couple of the plastic covers on the back still have the plastic protective covers from the manufacturer . There is normal swirl marks on this guitar from use and one chip that you can see in the picture. This chip is about the size of the tip of your finger. I will not pull off the stickers as I will leave this to you. This is how I received the guitar when I bought this and I have played it with the stickers on the guitar. I did not want to take a chance of screwing it up and I have a Harley Davidson so it did not bother me to leave the stickers in the guitar. No Warranty and no returns. This guitar has an outstanding rating and is very very very hard to find one for sale. All knobs and pickups work as they should just the cosmetic issues I am selling because I have mostly Autographed guitars and am working a deal for a Prince Stage player and autographed guitar. So needless to say I need to sell a few pieces to achieve my goal. Please see the pictures and the ratings of this guitar. It is a dream to play and hopefully a dream for you to own one. When I bought this guitar I bought 2 of them. One to hand on wall and 1 to play. I sold the Mint condition one and now this one must go also The original purchase price of this guitar without a case was $799.00 new. Please note the cover on the back with the sticker are not scratches. It still has the protective plastic in it. SHIPPING IS IN USA ONLY!!! If you would like this shipped in a different method other than USPS please let me know or you can pick up in person and save the shipping cost Good Luck and Fire away. . Happy Holidays Remember this is a 1st edition Zombie Clockworks model EC-CZ and there are only 900 in existence. This is the Only one currently for sale I could find on any site.
