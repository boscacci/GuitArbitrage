{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Offered here is my 2005 Epiphone Elitist 1963 ES-335 Dot model guitar in vintage sunburst. This guitar is in excellent condition. There are a few very light scratches here and there, but none that are anything close to be through the finish. It is completely stock with the exception of the Kluson Deluxe vintage tuners I installed to make it look more \"period correct.\" This guitar has nowhere near the usage marks you would expect to see on a 2005 guitar. It is a joy to play. For those of you who are not familiar with the Elitist story, they were manufactured in a dedicated factory in Japan using all U.S. material and components under Gibson supervision. They have earned the reputation as being as good and some say better in quality than their Gibson Nashville and Memphis counterparts; while costing about one third as much as Gibson U.S. guitars. It is for this reason that Gibson decided to stop their manufacture, or risk losing continued sales of their U.S. manufactured guitars. They were, and are, all that good. This one has never been out of my smoke-free home. It has been infrequently played and there is basically no fret wear. I just need to thin the herd. Too many guitars - so little time. It comes in its original Elitist hardshell case. No international bidders, please. No exceptions - don't ask. I only ship within the U.S. Thanks for looking!", "ItemID": "163565518654", "EndTime": "2019-02-25T21:59:51.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-25T17:06:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Elitist-1963-ES-335-Dot-Electric-Guitar-O-E-M-Hardshell-Case-/163565518654", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Allen Park, Michigan", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635655186548080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NUcAAOSw~jpcYwvl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hfwAAOSwPaBcYwv3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/USwAAOSwYXVcYwwU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XroAAOSwbu1cYwwz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/eFYAAOSwL8xcYwvC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/I7wAAOSw6xVcYwvG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Gr0AAOSwdfVcYwxP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~VcAAOSwqhtcYwvO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "48101", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "golfsnobdennis", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2205, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 1350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 1350.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 103}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Elitist 1963 ES-335 Dot Electric Guitar with O.E.M.
