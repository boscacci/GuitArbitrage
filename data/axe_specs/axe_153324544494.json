{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale, a Jackson Randy Rhoads RR1T finished in Snow White with black pinstripes and in near mint condition, complete with the original hardshell case. A rare hardtail version of the RR1, this USA-made Jackson is designed for speed and articulation, with a resonance not afforded the more common vibrato-equipped iterations of the Rhoads model. The Rhoads guitars follow in the footsteps of the axe that brought Jackson to prominence. Originally commissioned by the late, great Randy Rhoads, his namesake guitar was actually the first Jackson made. It quickly gained a following in hard rock circles soon after production began in the early 1980s, and has been played by such luminaries as Metallica's Kirk Hammett, Megadeth's Marty Friedman, and Adrian Smith from Iron Maiden, among many others. More than 25 years after the design first made waves, the Rhoads' aggressive body shape remains unmistakable, and it plays as fast as it looks.Crafted with maple neck through construction, alder body wings, and loaded with Seymour Duncan humbuckers, the RR1T is a versatile, resonant guitar with a great range of traditional humbucker tones. The Seymour Duncan JB SH-4 humbucker in the bridge position is a unique design which uses a completely balanced coil configuration to produce great harmonics and a high output with just the right blend of sustain and distortion. The neck position SH1 '59 model is a vintage-output humbucker which has a complexity and response befitting a PAF. The guitar is remarkably light at 7lbs 1oz and has been strung with fresh 10-46 strings.The maple neck has a very slender and fast C shaped profile, with a compound radius (12\" to 16\") ebony fretboard and jumbo fretwire. The frets are flawless, playing cleanly up the 25 1/2\" scale. The nut is a full 1 11/16\" in width. All of the electronics work as intended, with sleek black anodized aluminum hardware. Cosmetically, the gloss Snow White finish accented by black pinstriping is clean as can be, and we can't find a scratch on it.The original SKB molded hardshell case is included.
