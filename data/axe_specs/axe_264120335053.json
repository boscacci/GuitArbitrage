{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Ibanez S7320 7 string electric guitar for sale, with ZR tremolo. Everything works fine and it plays great with nice thin wizard neck, set up with nice action, in excellent shape was barely played, only problems are a couple hairline scratches and small dings, and some tarnished screws on the tremolo, see pics. The trem is set up works well and stays in tune, the screw wheel makes it really easy to set up with new strings, also includes ZPS2 stabilizer which I took out for easier tremolo, but it's easy to just pop it back in. Comes with Gator guitar slinger bag, new Sinister Strings 7 string set, original 700 dollar receipt for the guitar, and other stuff pictured.
