{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "If you looked up the definition of \u201cwork-horse guitar\u201d in the dictionary, this guitar would appear. This guitar has been in my family for awhile and it has been used on small local recording projects in South Alabama and was my cousin\u2019s main gigging guitar before his passing in 2017. It\u2019s a great guitar with only a few minor flaws. The frets are slightly worn on the first 3 or 4 frets, but nothing to lose sleep over. The finish towards the bottom of the guitar is stained from where my cousin and former lead guitarist had a Roland synth hooked up to the guitar. Lastly, the saddles will probably need to be replaced if this guitar is going to heavily gigged again. They are not in total shambles, but they were rusted over after sitting for a while. I did my best to clean off all the rust, but ended up having to replace one of them. Now with the cons out of the way, time for the pros. The guitar\u2019s intonation is pretty solid. The timers are fully functional. The electronics have been cleaned and play flawless. The neck is super fast to play on and is also an enjoyable experience to jam with. I hate to part with it, but some family matters have arose.
