{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale is a vintage Guild X50 cordoba archtop electric guitar. This is a X50 has a great sound and features a surprisingly strong and high output Guild style P-90 pickup. Made in Hoboken, New Jersey, this is a great example of the craftsmanship Guild's of yesteryear which are becoming increasingly popular. Structurally, this guitar is in great shape with no binding, bracing issues, and the top is not sunken in at all. This guitar has been professionally re-fretted and plays like a dream. The pickup and the electronics are original, but I just replaced the tuners with quality kluson tuners. The original tuners will be included in the structured bag that is included. The pots are original and work, but they are a little scratchy and some times the volume pot is a little finicky when set on 100% volume.The Brazilian rosewood fingerboard and bridge look and sound awesome. This is a great chance to get one of the rarer Guild models out there from a historic era of Guild guitars. The guitar will be professionally shipped and insured.Free Shipping in the Continental USA!
