{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For sale 2011 Fender American Vintage 52 Hot Rod Telecaster with Original Hardshell Case, tags etc. This guitar also has a Fender 60th Anniversary Neck Plate commemorating the 60th year of the Telecaster. This guitar is a beauty, a real player's guitar that is difficult to put down. The frets have a lot of life and the action is lower than usual and you can still do full bends anywhere on the neck without it fretting out or buzzing. The neck is a U shaped neck that is thick but comfortable. There are three small blemishes in the body (see pictures)but is a thin nitro finish so it's going to age very nicely. I took the pictures so you can see exactly where they are at, and how small they are. I honestly always forgot that they were there, that's how good they blend in. Other than that the guitar is immaculate, that's the only reason I am listing it as very good. No dings or dents on the neck or anywhere else other than the three pictured. Comes with original Fender G&G case. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!
