{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "**UPDATE** Found the original case along with information about when the guitar was bought. This is mid 90's Ibanez. Likely an LGM. I have bought a new Floyd Rose bridge since purchasing this guitar and replaced it as the old one did not work well. New bridge didn't have a whammy bar but I'm including the old one with the whammy bar as a bonus. The whammy bar fits but has a locking mechanism that the new bridge doesn't have. I added locking mechanisms for the bar strap. Including strap with locking nuts. The bridge pickup is a Seymour Duncan PATB-2 Parallel Axis Trembucker 21.3k. The middle and neck are Parellel Axis Single Coil Stack Humbuckers PA-stk1w 6.8k. These pick-ups new are worth easily $300. 5 Way switch. The volume position is a concentric pot that does both valume and master tone. The next knob is a pull-up pot that is in series mode and rotates from dual coil to single coil in the down position and in parallel in the up position. The buttom knob run the bridge pick-up and in the down position fades from both coils to a single coil in series and in the up position put the humbucker in parallel mode. Maple Neck. Body feels feels heftier than basswood. It was painted with Automotive acrylic enamel and many clear coast and the buffed down to a high gloss. Minor paint chips. Works perfect.", "ItemID": "372559633954", "EndTime": "2019-01-13T17:55:08.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-06T17:55:08.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/UPDATED-Custom-Ibanez-Floyd-Rose-Bridge-Seymour-Duncans-included-case-/372559633954", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Staunton, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/3725596339548080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/v2UAAOSwmvpcMj~9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/68AAAOSwwDJcMkAA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IzkAAOSwiT1cMmuq/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RjcAAOSwws5cMmu~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s1YAAOSwXF5cM9C7/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NosAAOSwmPlcM9C-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xgAAAOSwU65cM9C~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/2EQAAOSwzExcM9DC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "24401", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "hump_3578", "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 4, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 229.4, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 229.4, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "g***7", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 117}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "**UPDATED** Custom Ibanez Floyd Rose Bridge with Seymour Duncans (included case)", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Green"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 468, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 231.9, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
