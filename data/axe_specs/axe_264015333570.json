{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "OVERVIEW:Adult owned. Have had it less than a year and it's in great shape. Never taken live, plays and sounds fantastic. Mainly just selling it because I will be moving into a new apt soon and need to cut costs somewhere. FLAWS: Only real flaws that I could find are just a couple finish flaws. (see pictures) One of them looks like a tiny spec of dust or wood shaving got caught under the lacquer at the factory and the other one appears to be a crack, but I assure you it isn't. Small little red line in the finish, less than 1cm and that's lacquered over as well. Very hard to notice unless you're looking for it. EXTRA GOODIES:The guitar has also been upgraded with a no load 500k tone pot as well as a push/push volume pot, as opposed to the push/pull that it originally comes with. There are also Schaller strap lock buttons preinstalled and you will receive the Dunlop strap as well as the locks, as you can see in the picture. Last but not least you will also receive a random assortment of picks just for the sake of sweetening the deal a little more. Two Snarling Dog 1.14mm Brain Picks, three Gravity Picks (.90mm Razer, .9mm Sunrise, 1.1mm Classic) and two Dunlop Max Grip 1.14mm Nylon picks. The Gravity Picks alone go for about $5 a piece. --- SPECS:Maple and Alder Body, Flamed Maple LaminatedMaple Neck with Rosewood FingerboardGraph Tech TUSQ NutSeymour Duncan Pickups/SP90-1n, TB-14Push-Push Coil Split Control (Volume Knob)No load 500k Tone PotHardtail Bridge with Graph Tech String Saver SaddlesGrover Locking TunersLet me know if you have any questions!
