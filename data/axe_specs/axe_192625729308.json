{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for sale is an 80\u2019s Burny RLC-70 electric guitar. The neck was broken at the heel joint and completely separated from the body. It was a pretty clean break with minimal splintering. Franklin Tite Bond was used to glue the neck back into place. Its a strong repair and aligned properly. You can barely feel the crack line when playing but there is a small dent right on the crack line that can be felt. A piece of the top and binding at the neck joint near the pickup selector was chipped off and filled with black epoxy. It looks okay from a few feet away but obvious when inspected closely. The guitar appears to be completely original. Overall, the guitar is in good playing shape. The action is pretty low and the neck profile is a slim 60\u2019s. The neck is straight and truss rod functions as it should. The frets are in great shape showing some minor wear. All electronics are checked and sound great. Original pickups which are apparently VH1\u2019s. Gig bag included. I will ship well packaged in a proper box. Thanks for looking and please ask any questions. Most my items ship the next day if purchased before 8pm EST.", "ItemID": "192625729308", "EndTime": "2019-01-04T07:02:36.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-08-13T00:13:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/80-s-Burny-Japan-RLC-70-Les-Paul-Custom-Electric-Guitar-Black-Repaired-/192625729308", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1926257293088080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pPMAAOSwBsNbcMoT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uI4AAOSwymBbcMoV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f4YAAOSwLg5bcMoW/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gfgAAOSw6U9bcMoY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pSEAAOSwcgxbcMoZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kFAAAOSwmcZbcMob/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vdQAAOSwIUFbcMoc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mOYAAOSwVmVbcMoe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JosAAOSwmodbcMof/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LgkAAOSwcjdbcMoh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g4EAAOSwkNZbcMoi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Q84AAOSwWo5bcMoj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "15241", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "stigatsu", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Green", "FeedbackScore": 6611, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.9}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 560.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "v***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 3}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Worldwide"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "80\u2019s Burny Japan RLC-70 Les Paul Custom Electric Guitar Black Repaired", "HitCount": 12390, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
