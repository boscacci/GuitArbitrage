{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Heavily modified Line 6 Variax, 500 modded with a USACG Birdseye maple neck (25.5\u201d (648 mm) Scale Length 1.650\u201d (42 mm) Nut Width 12\u201d Radius (305 mm) Sperzel locking tuners with all power supplies and cables, comes with gig bag, plays great and sounds great, also has a Lollar Charlie Christian style pickup in the neck position. comes with a gig bag. The Variax was working when I purchased this in March 2018. Now I get a green light on the box but I'm not getting any sound from the Variax setting. It could be an internal switch or wire. I use it primarily for the synth and the Lollar neck pickup. The USAGC Telecaster neck is very well made. It has a wider nut width. This was made for playing jazz and chording. Ebony fretboard. The neck alone must have cost $400. The Synth was modded as well and an extra power supply was mounted internally. . The switches allow for Synth, Variax, and standard pickup, in any combination or together. Includes all power supply and cables for the variax and 13 pin cable. This is a one of kind guitar for someone who wants to trouble shoot the Variax issue or just use it as I do now. I have a Roland VG 88 for sale if interested. Please contact me with questions .
