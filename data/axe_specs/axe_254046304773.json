{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "I am having a STOREWIDE SALE this week!! I am taking some needed time off and I am blowing out a limited amount of items. Sale ends Sunday! IN BUSINESS for 33 YEARS!! 45 YEARS EXPERIENCE! Brick and mortar to the end! Michigan Guitar Show Promoter since 1989! Note: Our 30th ANNIVERSARY GUITAR SHOW is coming June 29th.-30th. 2019 at the Emerald Theatre in downtown Mt. Clemens, Michigan just 20 miles north of downtown Detroit. Stay tuned our website for more updates. This is going to be 'The Event' of the year! This fine guitar is VERY clean and is in almost in mint condition. The top is PERFECT! The frets show NO wear. The back of the body has some almost invisible belt buckle marks that do NOT show in the pictures and are VERY hard to see in person. There are a few nicks in the finish on the back and sides of the body that are very small with a spec of a nick to the wood right near the cavity cover. I mean this 19 year old guitar,,,, looks NEW!! By the way I cleaned, seasoned the fretboard with fresh Ernie .10-.46 strings and she rings out loud without being plugged in. A ringer of a guitar with a lot of TONE! Plays fantastic. Man does this thing look gorgeous on stage under the lights,,,????? I can only imagine!! I mean I have seen or sold maybe 2 of these in the past 19 years. This guitar is hard to stop looking at!!! Weighs 9 lbs. 5 oz. Comes with the original Gibson Brown combination case.
