{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a beautiful 2008 American Standard Stratocaster with original hard shell case. The case candy is included as well. This guitar has seen very little use, studio only and has never been played out. It is very clean, with only the most minor clear coat scratches and a couple of minor dings on the headstock as shown in the pics. There are also a couple of minor but more noticeable clear coat scratches near the jack that you can see in the pic.The pictures don't do the sunburst justice. It sounds great, plays great, and is expertly setup and intonated. There is little to no fretwear as it was just used in the studio from time to time. This is a great guitar and probably one of the cleanest you'll find. I really hate to part with it but bills must be paid. Thanks for looking and please let me know if you have any questions.", "ItemID": "283231802268", "EndTime": "2018-10-31T00:00:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-28T00:00:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-2008-Sunburst-OHSC-MADE-USA-/283231802268", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Bardwell, Kentucky", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2832318022688080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1OTQ=/z/CtcAAOSwBFlb0Qsx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjM0WDE2MDA=/z/dFgAAOSwB5lb0Qsj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMlgxNjAw/z/5-cAAOSwEJlb0Qss/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDM2/z/edsAAOSwjatb0Qs4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzA5/z/U4kAAOSwgPBb0Qs~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDc0/z/zZMAAOSwRBVb0QtE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDUz/z/5C8AAOSwZdRb0QtJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg1NTc=/z/bZwAAOSwfjVb0QtP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzY5/z/LtsAAOSwk35b0QtV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Nzg=/z/QO0AAOSw1fJb1N9v/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzc4WDE2MDA=/z/45sAAOSwy45b1N9z/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Njg1WDY5OA==/z/Tm8AAOSwoVZb1OHa/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "42023", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "canarymburns", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1088, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 13, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 621.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 621.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "t***2", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 305}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender American Standard Stratocaster 2008 Sunburst with OHSC MADE IN USA", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["American Standard Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2008"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 586, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 631.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Very clean, just minor clear coat scratches from normal use and a couple of minor dings on the headstock.
