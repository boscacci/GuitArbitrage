{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "NOTICE: I tried several times to revise the shipping to calculate based on buyers location, it would not do it. please be advised that I will send buyer an invoice at the end of auction. Usually between 25.00 and 55.00 based on location. you will pay what I pay, no more, sorry but I tried. Very nice Ibanez guitar in excellent shape, not a beater, has been well cared for. The neck serial number is GS120312910 . Ibanez Gio. It has the really neat looking Shark Tooth inlay on the neck. I installed the new Custom White strings to match the body color and they look cool and sound good as compared to the older colored strings they came out with a few years back. This unit comes with a new White strap and three white picks to match as well. eBay says its a RG, it is not, I tried to revise listing twice, refer to numbers above.Included is a genuine Ibanez fitted hard shell case which is also in excellent shape, no broken feet or bad latches. These cases are 149.00 new on eBay all the time. Thanks for looking and may God Bless.", "ItemID": "202525883190", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T01:44:37.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-05T08:00:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-Excellent-shape-Shark-tooth-inlay-neck-custom-White-strings-/202525883190", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Carlsbad, New Mexico", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025258831908080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Z1sAAOSwXgxcB4Ee/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/gDEAAOSwenJcB4Ep/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/l04AAOSwySZcB4Ez/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/nXEAAOSwzqtcB4E6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/6lsAAOSwzXJcB4FA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/YGEAAOSwEONcB4FY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/BKcAAOSwdHpcB4Fw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/qloAAOSws2RcB4F9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/PD8AAOSw6X1cB4GG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Nf8AAOSwtYZcB4GQ/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/Yq8AAOSwCNlcB4Gc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/aJQAAOSwcttcB4G8/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "88220", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "vetruck50", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 799, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 150.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "1***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 28}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez, Excellent shape, Shark tooth inlay on neck, custom White strings.", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["Unknown"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Gio"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 152, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78667127", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
