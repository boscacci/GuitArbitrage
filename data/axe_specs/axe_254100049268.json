{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars!!! Shipping to the lower 48 states FedEx only,no PO Boxes.I will not ship anywhere else.Make sure to check out my other 100 guitars at my ebay store \"Axes Bold As Love Guitars\". Here is a very cool Epiphone Les Paul 100 arch top with some nice upgrades. The guitar is in good condition but has a good size chip on the back edge near the control cover plate,also has a small indentation near the neck pickups tone control knob, otherwise just mild surface scratches. First I traded out the tuners with some nice Grover style diecast tuners. Next I did a quick set up to get some nice low action going on. I also changed the pickups to some nice Hot Epiphone Black/Cream Zebras from an Epiphone Les Paul Slash AFD [12k-neck,16k-bridge]. I then upgraded the stock tone capacitor with some nice Japanese Nichicon polyester film and foil caps. Sounded very full on clean tones and growled like a junk yard dog once I added some gain. Get a really good playing ,great sounding Les Paul if you can deal with the chip. Guitar plays and sounds way better than stock. Guitar looks,plays,and sounds great. Please study the pictures to get a better idea. I only ship fully insured to the lower 48 states,and nowhere else. I describe all guitars to the best of my abilities.I don't take every guitar apart to check every freaking screw.I disclose all pimples just so there are no misunderstandings.All guitars are sold as is. Insurance is included in my shipping and handling charges.I will not ship out of the U.S. My feedback is public record,and I aim to keep it good. I will no longer do local pickups period.
