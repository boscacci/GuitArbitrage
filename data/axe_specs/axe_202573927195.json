{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "For auction is a Kramer Focus 1000 guitar made in Japan original Kramer with Floyd Rose Tremelo. This guitar has good action. Very low and frets are in great shape. Not sure if pickup is original but it sounds great. Guitar has some marks on body no cracks in finish and neck is smooth. Back plate has chipped corner and wear. Front of headstock has some scratches. Overall guitar is in great cosmetic shape. This guitar has the original Kramer case that has some wear. Case latches good and is not bulky. The floyd works good. I have it set to my personal preference I have been using other guitars more than this one recently and dont take this one out at all. Could use a string change. Coming from a smoke free home. Shipping is $90 on this guitar. I ship these with care. Shipping in USA only.", "ItemID": "202573927195", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T02:43:17.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-23T03:51:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/1980s-Kramer-Focus-1000-Original-Case-Floyd-Rose-Made-Japan-Blue-Rare-/202573927195", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Shelbyville, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2025739271958080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/OVoAAOSwgbdcR-R7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vCIAAOSwyPFcR-SI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/S5YAAOSw3T5cR-SV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8noAAOSw5pRcR-O7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/bkQAAOSwV0NcR-PA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QsMAAOSwNepcR-PE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/udgAAOSwi6dcR-PJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Zn0AAOSwqLlcR-Sm/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "46176", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "d_k77", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 543, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 98.1}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 399.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "0***v", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 747}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "1980's Kramer Focus 1000 with Original Case Floyd Rose Made in Japan Blue Rare ", "HitCount": 198, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
