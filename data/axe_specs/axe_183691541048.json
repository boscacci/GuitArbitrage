{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Lovely original 24 fret 1984 Rickenbacker 350 in jetglo. USA made in the early eighties to represent john lennons famous 60's 325 but with 24 frets if it had been available at the time. Really great condition with a few minor blemishes and very minor buckle rash (see description but they really are tiny and i'm pretty fussy). Everything works great, its awesome but to be honest i got it very recently (i've only had it a month!), but now really need the money hence new low price. Im also more used to guitars with a floyd rose and cant really condone having yet another guitar just because i've always loved the beatles. Rickenbacker are re-issueing this in the form of the 350v63 liverpool now which have a much higher price and come with a 2 year waiting list. Personally i prefer this original.It really has the most beautifulll neck (Polished bubinga i think?) great paintwork. All electrics working and original, 3 high gain pickups which mean its got the beatles vibe but is in no way limited to that, and plays beautifully. With plenty of fret life. Nice slender neck and original R tailpiece, all chrome in great condition.(apparently I was told these are over 400 gbp from Rickenbacker alone but you'll have to check that). The blue lined case is also in great condition, especially for it's age and includes 2 keys. Would prefer cash on collection but if not buyer to pay actual postage, email prior if international for shipping quotes. You're welcome to choose a courier but I will arrange collection. You are also welcome to come and see before buying. Im confident you'll love it. Guitar for sale elsewhere. i'll be Really sad to see it go. If collecting I can drive a reasonable distance or meet halfway. Payment by Paypal, bank Transfer or cash. All reasonable offers considered. No silly offers or time wasters please.
