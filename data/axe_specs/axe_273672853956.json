{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a custom professionally-built Stratocaster with many extras. Mahogany (I believe) body with smooth satin stain finish so wood grain shows, some Fender American parts, DiMarzio Steve Morse Humbuckers, Mighty Mite maple neck with 22-fret ebony fingerboard, Sperzel locking tuners, great trem system, with Fender gig bag. It is super clean, plays great, sounds amazing. No issues, cracks, scratches, etc. There is some finish lifting on back next to the trem access plate. That is a rough spot but not noticeable when playing. See photos. What looks like marks around the plastic back plates is just the original plastic still on them - has never been taken off. Some minor marks here and there, a minor indentation in back of neck - all from gentle use. No buckle rash. Guitar weighs in at 6 pounds. Fender gig bag does have two broken zipper pulls on the outside pockets (zippers work), and one missing pull on the outside small pocket, so that small pocket does not close. There is one main zipper and it works fine. It cost about $800 to have this guitar built to my specs - I just don\u2019t play it and it needs to be played. Will include two new sets of D\u2019Addario 10\u2019s in the gig bag pocket as well as the Fender electric guitar stand in photos. Will also include the truss rod wrench and a set of Fender Strapblocks - there are Dunlop strap button now on the guitar, but I do not have the top pieces. Neck is wonderful and ebony fingerboard is sweet. Very very minimal fretwear on first few frets - can hardly see it. Please ask all questions before bidding as there are no returns. Will be professionally packed and shipped insured.
