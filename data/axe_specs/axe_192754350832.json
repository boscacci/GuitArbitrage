{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for Auction is this beautiful vintage \"top of the line\" 1980 Gibson Les Paul Custom in natural color with an ebony fingerboard. This was purchased by me over twenty years ago used but well taken care of. The history was told to me by the owner that it was played in a semi famous band in Columbia S.C. during the early eighties when Athens GA. and Columbia were exploding with new bands and new music. Called the \"Fretless Wonder\" this type of Les Paul is and was used by Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, Chris Cornell, James Hetfield, Randy Rhodes and many more first class guitarists.The guitar is in very good shape considering its age and was played very little by me. More of a show off piece than a player.It does have some signs of wear because of use, but does not distract from the sound or tone. I had it professionally gone thru and set up when I purchased it and was told by the tech that the tuning keys had been replaced some time in the past but this is common on Les Pauls. It does have a minor scratch and a nick that I've shown in two of the pictures. The pick ups and the pick guard are in excellent shape but the screws have some patina which can be cleaned up very easily. I personally left them this way because I didn't want a set of five dollar screws to take away the history of the sweat and tears this guitar has seen. It by no means is a show piece but wouldn't take much detailing to get it that way. It definitely is a head turner and sounds amazing. I have to unfortunately lean my collection due to financial stress so jump on this piece you wont be sorry. I put no reserve on it so take advantage of this and get it before Christmas. I had it appraised a while back and it fell in the $2500-$3500 price range. Maybe more now because of all the Japanese stuff. The manufacture date was 12/19/1980 and made in Michigan. It does include the original hard shell case with furry lining. I've set the shipping at $100 plus or minus because I want it protected but if it comes in lower I'll refund the difference back thru Paypal. Auction winner give me your zip and i'll find the cheapest and best. Some sellers make money off of the shipping but not me. So keep the shipping in mind please. Thanks for looking and check my feedback for confidence in me as a seller. I've done my best to accurately describe this beauty but seeing is believing! If you have bad feedback then don't bid because you will be deleted. Payment is due within five days, Paypal preferred and remember if you want it before Christmas pay for it quick and i'll try to get it out within one day.", "ItemID": "192754350832", "EndTime": "2018-12-18T03:00:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-11T03:00:01.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-1980-Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom-electric-guitar-Natural-in-Great-Condition-/192754350832", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1927543508328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XmwAAOSwcDdcDs7T/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/GcQAAOSw9g1cDcqw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/zKAAAOSwEp5cDcrG/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/hdAAAOSwylhcDcrV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/lK8AAOSw175cDcrm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uKwAAOSwQH5cDcr4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9MQAAOSwu4dcDcsM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ikcAAOSwp3dcDcsb/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IXYAAOSwKSlcDcsu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/d1cAAOSw19dcDs6m/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/pmoAAOSw0YlcDs67/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "29577", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mid*life", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 286, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 26, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2576.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2576.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***b", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 223}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Vintage 1980 Gibson Les Paul Custom electric guitar\u00a0Natural in\u00a0Great Condition ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson Les Paul"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1980"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 847, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 2626.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
