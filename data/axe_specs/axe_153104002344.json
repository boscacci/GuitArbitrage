{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello! Up for sale is a super terrific, USA made Fender Stratocaster style guitar by Peavey....the Predator ! Vintage from the 1990s Low hours ever since it's been owned by me. All solid woods (maple neck, poplar body)I believe this guitar's body finish is in a nitrocellulose lacquer All electronics work good. And boy does she sound great plugged in through an amp, like my Baby Budda, also for sale here on ebay !!!! Straight, fast neckWith minimal fret wear Nice grain character on the fretboard, especially starting around the 11th fret. No wear on the back of the neck, which does not seem to be lacquered, making it easier for your hands to glide up and down the neck for speedy playing! Professionally setup by a reputable dealer here in the greater Charlotte, NC metro area.Literally plays like butter! (as well or better than a Strat) Comes with a nice chipboard type case, still harder than a gig bag. It's not the prettiest looking thing. But we try to ship our guitars in as hard as a case as possible (or available) so that there is an extra layer of protection to survive the rigors of being handled by the shipping companies ! Highly rated and regarded by many guitarists.These USA Peavey guitars are way underrated overall, though. Put this up against any off-shore,MIK, or MIM guitar. About the same price point as the MIM strats, but imho, superior in many aspects!Great bang for the buckYou will not be disappointed by this axe ! Buy AmericanUSA, USA, USA made Please read the condition description, these listing details,and examine the pictures carefully. Thanks so much for your interest and I hope you buy it now!!!!!!", "ItemID": "153104002344", "EndTime": "2018-12-30T03:17:07.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-07-17T23:05:18.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Made-USA-Red-Peavey-Predator-Excellent-clean-almost-flawless-shape-/153104002344", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fort Mill, South Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1531040023448080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2MjM=/z/BwUAAOSwxblbTnST/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg2Njc=/z/~SMAAOSwc15bTnSy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA5N1g4ODI=/z/zOEAAOSwOaBbTnTn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg1NzA=/z/QtAAAOSwj~5bTnUL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExOVg4ODY=/z/wJ8AAOSwzbdbTnUh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3MzM=/z/EjgAAOSwxipbTnVB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg0WDE0ODc=/z/SrEAAOSwedRbTnVj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM0N1g3NTU=/z/RDwAAOSwj~5bTnWD/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODg4WDE1NDM=/z/LyYAAOSwjvJbTnWk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDMwWDE1ODc=/z/qcIAAOSwkuVbTnW~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU4NFg3NTA=/z/e20AAOSwDg1bTnYA/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MzYxWDE1ODc=/z/VrEAAOSwjMdbZIxY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "29707", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "heavyspender", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 3195, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 96.7}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 295.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "2***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 156}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["Americas", "Europe", "Asia", "AU", "NZ", "EG", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Made in the USA Red Peavey Predator !

Looks almost mint save for one ding in the paint about the size of a pinhead on the back of the guitar on the lower bout. We have dabbed red marker in the spot and it is barely noticeable unless you are really looking up close and looking for it. Before selling, we will clean/buff the body and back of the neck of the guitar with Clayton polish. Strings will be cleaned with string cleaner, even though they are pretty much brand new. And the fretboard will be conditioned with the same polish and not lemon oil, because the fretboard is maple.......So the lucky buyer can just plug her in and start rockin' out !!!!!", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
