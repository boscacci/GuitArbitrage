{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Epiphone Zakk Wylde Les Paul Custom Plus Bullseye Item Description Ozzy Osbourne / Black Label Society guitarist Han in Han \"Zakk Wylde\" signature model arrived! Because this instrument will be a model made by Epiphone which was discontinued with production being missed, is not there a lot of people looking for? It is reflected in the satin finish maple neck and signature that can get smooth fingering and clear brightness to the top paint of bull's eye which is also a trademark of Zach! Of course, the pickup is equipped with EMG 81/85 and the gorigori sound which can be obtained because it is stress-free and noiseless is driven by the impulse to unintentionally want to decide picking harmonics! It is a perfect gem for those looking for Les Paul who feels Han! \u3010SPEC\u3011 Body : Mahogany Neck : Maple Fingerboard : Rosewood Pickups : HH Weight : 4.2kg Color : Bullseye Serial Number : Condition: Used Although there are very few pick scratch marks etc., since the neck condition is good and all the electrical parts parts are exchanged for new goods at our shop, you can use it with ease at ease.
