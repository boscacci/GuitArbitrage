{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Very Good Condition Junior Model, with a 700T humbucker. Great guitar for a beginner or collector. These discontinued models rock. Far better than anything in their price range. These 2 guitars were used as displays for a trade show and was only played for testing before selling. The plastic is still on the pick guard and the compartment cover. I removed the plastic from the pickup for testing. There is a couple of very small indents which do not show in pictures. Other than that, the guitars are in excellent condition. The neck is straight and the action is nice, for a stock set up. I have treated the neck and polished the body.", "ItemID": "382771947796", "EndTime": "2019-02-26T02:24:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-06T19:33:32.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-PRO-1-Les-Paul-Jr-Electric-Guitar-Pack-Alpine-White-Used-/382771947796", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Los Angeles, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/3827719477968080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ZDUAAOSwmo1cWzUt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dKwAAOSwu4dcWzU2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Y4MAAOSwY4JcWzU~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/VwYAAOSw5rlcWzVX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/~UAAAOSwB0lcWzVw/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YrEAAOSwPYRcWzV5/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/icMAAOSwsTJcWzWi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90040", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 2, "Seller": {"UserID": "mrqualitycontro1", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 10, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 2, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "MX"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone PRO-1 Les Paul Jr Electric Guitar Pack (Alpine White) Used", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["PPEG-ENPLAWCH1"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["700T Humbuckler", "Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Junior"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Indonesia"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2015"]}]}, "HitCount": 736, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalRefund": "MoneyBack", "InternationalReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsAccepted", "InternationalShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitars were used as displays for an event, and played them only for testing.
