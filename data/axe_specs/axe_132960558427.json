{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here is a Washburn Dan Donegan DD-60 Maya electric guitar. It is in very good condition with little wear with the exception of 1 ding on the left side of the guitar. I have it pictured. Other than that this guitar is pretty flawless. This guitar features a mahogany string thru body, a mahogany neck with rosewood fretboard, the Buzz Feiten tuning system, Grover tuners, and a pair of hot Egnater humbucker pickups. All electronics function as they should with no problems. Fretboard has very little to no fretwear. What makes this guitar stand apart from others is the custom finish that is on it. It seems to be a gray mystery finish with faces and skulls. It is in both front and back and up the back of the neck and both sides of the headstock. The pictures really do not do it justice. It\u2019s a beautiful guitar. This guitar is a metal machine. Sounds great, plays great, looks great. It will be shipped in a very nice padded gig bag. This would be a great gift for any guitar player or an excellent addition to any collection. Thanks for looking and good luck.
