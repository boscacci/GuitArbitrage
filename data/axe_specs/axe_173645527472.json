{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a Really old original set of Joe Barden prototype Pick Ups. 99.5% used by Danny Gatton. I am Not listing close up's of the documentation, but it is available if needed because I do not want to hold anyone responsible for any (.5%) reason. I got these pickups from someone who owned a vintage guitar shop in/near Virginia Beach VA. and he bought Danny's 1955 Gibson Les Paul Custom from a client who lived in Washington DC. These pickups were in the guitar and the original pickups were in the case. He re-installed the original P90 and Alnico V and put these in a box. He bought the 1955 Les Paul a few years after Danny passed away from a collector who lived in MD., he then sold the Les Paul to a \"well known\" group in Dallas TX who I contacted and they verified that that did \"A lot\" of high end guitar deals together. I tried contacting Joe Barden, he had already gone into \"retirement\" but a Very reliable source (he is in the paper work) who works at JBE Guitar and Bass pickups told me that these pickups are authentic Bardens. They are Strat pickups housed in P90 cover. He told me these may have been Joe's or Danny's attempt to put a noise free pickup into one of Danny's guitars. He also states that Danny himself was a tinkerer, so whether Joe did it for him or Danny did it himself or if either one did it at all? So there is the \"only question mark\". I truly believe \"feel it\" that all roads lead to it..... I was friends with Shaw Lane, I remember when the Guitar Player magazine came out with Danny on the cover and the issue had one of Shawn's first page articles, we when to the store in East Memphis and got every copy of it they had.. I have very rare recordings and videos of Shawn that would \"Never\" be sold for money etc. Having said all of this, I got these pickups because I wanted to put them in one of my guitars and play them, I have second thoughts about this. I think they need to go to someone or somewhere to a different level guitar player than I am. NO RESERVE. Free Shipping. A piece of musical history. 901.834.5829 Please contact me or email with any questions/concerns \"before\" bidding or buying. Thanks for reading all of this and good luck - God Bless.
