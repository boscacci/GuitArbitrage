Fifty years later we are proud to share a piece of that history with you. Description On a chilly evening in March of 1968, Jimi Hendrix asked a young Seymour W. Duncan to walk his guitar up onstage. That Strat was loaded with pickups Seymour had wound just for Jimi, and that unforgettable night would set in motion Seymour\u2019s future \u2013 and his legacy almost five decades later. Now you can be a bit closer to Jimi\u2019s world with our Jimi Hendrix\u2122 Signature Strat Set. Like Jimi\u2019s music, the Jimi Hendrix Signature Strat Set pickups have their roots in the traditional but with an eye on the future. Each is custom wound for a richer, melodic tone. The bridge model has an aggressive attack that cuts through while staying true to his iconic lead tone. The neck pickup sounds thick and full and is great for chord work, bluesy melodies, double-stops and Jimi\u2019s signature hybrid chord/melody style. And in the in-between positions there\u2019s plenty of that classic Strat \u2018quack.\u2019 To help you to get even closer to Jimi\u2019s earth-shattering tone, each pickup is made with a reverse magnet stagger to capture the effect of playing a right-handed guitar upside-down and restrung for a lefty. The white pickup covers showcase Jimi\u2019s signature. The set also comes with a commemorative booklet and stickers. Put a set in your Strat and prepare to be Experienced!
