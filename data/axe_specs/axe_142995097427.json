{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is an American Special Stratocaster. The body is a 2010 model loaded with a Super Vee Blade Runner tremolo, Custom Shop 69 Neck and Middle pickups, and a Fralin Steel Pole 43 Bridge pickup. It is shielded with conductive copper tape. All of the pots have been upgraded to 250K CTS pots, and it has an added treble bleed on the volume pot. The tones are currently wired to the middle and neck pickups. The neck is a 2014 USA American Special Strat Maple neck in excellent condition. The made in USA decal on back of headstock was removed before I purchased. Otherwise...Neck is in great shape. This will make a fantastic guitar, as the body is very resonant. There are some scuffs, dings, and dents on the body but no chips in the paint. There is no back plate included with the guitar. I've included a picture of the labels removed from the body and Fralin pickup, for verification purposes. Comes with the tremolo bar and padded gig bag. Will ship to lower 48 states only.
