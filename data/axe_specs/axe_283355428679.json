{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This auction is for a beautiful like new, working man's Tele ash loaded body in white with vintage mint green pickup cover. Pickups are Suhr Classic T neck and Suhr Classic T Bridge pickup. The middle on this Nashville style setup is a Suhr Middle V60's Low Peak. These are connected to a Oak Grigsby 5 way switch that gives five great tones; bridge, bridge and middle, middle, neck and middle and neck. Positions 2 and 4 are hum cancelling with the RWRP middle pickup. Tones in position 2, 3 and 4 are like the great strat tones from the 60's. Positions 1 and 4 are classic tele. This guitar can cover it all and does it beautifully. I can't sat enough about these pickups. Tones are absolutely amazing! All the awesomeness you have heard about Suhr Pickups is true. After playing and building guitars for 20+ years these are some of the best sounding tele pickups I have ever played. Sweet Classic telecaster tones from bridge and neck. And this middle Suhr V60's Low Peak is just amazing. Middle is so good I found myself going here over and over for smooth tones and that strat sound. As a combined, balanced set, you would be hard pressed to beat this combination. Capacitor is a vintage Russian PIO 033uf. Very nice quality. Switch is 5 way Oak Grigsby. Pot are 250K Bourns wired up with vintage style Gavitt cloth shielded wire. Everything on this build was done right. I build all my guitars with the goal of making an great player that will not break the bank. I've invested over $240 just in pickups, capacitor, wiring and switching. You could easily spend over a grand to get a setup that compares to this tonally. This is a lightly used body and there is some small paint chips around the ferrules and other minor signs of use. Overall paint is very good. Body weighs 6 lbs 5 oz +/- loaded. String Ferrules on back are just a little out of line. Nothing too noticeable and it is the back so your fans won't ever see it ;) All cavities are shielded for low noise. Bridge plate is a Fender pat. pend. with compensated brass saddles. Neck pocket is great. I fitted a Warmoth Tele neck and the neck pocket sizing is perfect. Just snug but not so tight as to cause any cracks. If you have any questions shoot me a note through EBay. Pictures are part of the description. Neck is not included but is shown in pictures just for an idea of what the complete package can look like.", "ItemID": "283355428679", "EndTime": "2019-02-01T22:30:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-27T20:59:47.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Tele-Body-Loaded-Suhr-Classic-T-Suhr-V60-Fender-Telecaster-Pat-Pend-Bridge-/283355428679", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Waynesville, North Carolina", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833554286798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/X3wAAOSwlSdcTg78/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dUEAAOSwvGZcThBy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wEQAAOSwPNhcThBm/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/rlYAAOSwF5VcThB-/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/XdcAAOSwH61cTg8e/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/dmAAAOSwgdtcTg8M/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ba4AAOSwQT9cO6VH/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/1e4AAOSwKwhcThFy/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/c1QAAOSwLgpcThCi/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RNEAAOSwfepcThC1/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTY1WDE1NTQ=/z/8gUAAOSwu4dcTiI2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ODIAAOSwusdcTg73/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "28785", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "1cheapracer22", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 303, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 259.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 259.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "k***k", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 107}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Tele Body Loaded Suhr Classic T Suhr V60 Fender Telecaster Pat Pend Bridge\u00a0", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Unbranded"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Custom"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["White"]}]}, "HitCount": 303, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
