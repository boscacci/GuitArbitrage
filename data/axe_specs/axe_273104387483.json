{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is this pretty rare gloss Candy Red made in Korea Squier By Fender HM Stratocaster Guitar with a factory Floyd Rose 2 Tremolo Bridge. This guitar has the HSH pick up configuration which offers the most tonal versatility. This is a 22 Fret shred machine. There is very little info on the web about these guitars. There is no case or Tremolo arm. The body on this particular model is based on that of the USA Fender Prodigy Guitars. There are two string locking blocks missing on the Floyd Rose Bridge high E & B string Saddles but they can be bought here on Ebay for pretty cheap. This guitar will need a set of strings and a set up to your liking. This guitar will come with a used gig bag. No hard sell case just a used gig bag. This guitar is in excellent shape for being almost 30 years old. The only flaw in the finish I can find or worth mentioning is on the side of the guitar by the rear strap button but it doesn\u2019t go through the finish and is hardly noticeable since the guitar (see first pic). This guitar is used but you\u2019d be hard pressed to know given its current condition. This is about as close to new as you\u2019re gonna find. These guitars are pretty rare and don\u2019t come up for sale very often as they are highly under rated and not many people even know they exist. You will not be disappointed with this guitar. Please review all pics as they are part of the description. Please ask any and all questions before purchasing as I do not accept returns. I only ship to the lower 48 states of the USA. That means that I do not ship to Alaska or Hawaii. I do not ship internationally so please don\u2019t ask. I do not ship to PO boxes or APO addresses. I only accept PayPal payment. This item will be packaged safe and secure and insured so that it arrives to you in the exact condition it leaves here. Please review my feedback and buy with confidence. This guitar is in fully functioning condition as are all the items I sell.", "ItemID": "273104387483", "EndTime": "2019-01-12T02:11:32.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-03-10T20:57:34.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-Squier-HM-Floyd-Rose-Stratocaster-Candy-Red-HSH-P-U-Gig-Bag-/273104387483", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Fredericksburg, Virginia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2731043874838080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IAoAAOSwlL1apEQJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9nEAAOSwqURapEQD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cy0AAOSwCNpapEP2/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LV4AAOSwKX9apEP-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LSsAAOSwKX9apEPr/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/awYAAOSwBoBapEPn/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vcQAAOSwrBdapEPh/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/lIUAAOSw3ZNapEPJ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tk0AAOSwAghapEO4/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/O8AAAOSwlL1apE7-/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/qowAAOSwKNhapEPZ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/5koAAOSwfqFapEO6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "22405", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "rodney6024", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1034, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.2, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.2, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 242}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender Squier HM Floyd Rose Stratocaster Candy Red HSH P/U & Gig Bag", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Squier"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["HM Stratocaster"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Candy Red"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Floyd Rose 2 Bridge"]}]}, "HitCount": 2997, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=299144936", "StoreName": "Happenstance Store"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
