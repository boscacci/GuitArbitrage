Ibanez - MC300 Musician Vintage Japanese guitar building at it's peak! These guitars combined all the knowledge the Japanese builders had learned from making incredibly well built copies of American guitars and then designed their own models. The MC300 has a neck through design, 2x Super 88 humbucking pickups that can be coil-tapped and in/out of phase for maximum number of tones out of one guitar. The neck is comfortable and plays fast, just an all around great guitar! This guitar has typical play wear for an instrument of it's age, some minor dings and surface scratches. Nothing major though, it was definitely well cared for by previous owner/s. All electronics are working 100% and the guitar plays very nicely. Please be sure to see all posted photos for detail on overall condition.
