{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Vintage American 1983 Fender \"Dan Smith\" Stratocaster in outstanding original condition with a factory hardshell case. Sienna burst finish on solid alder body. One piece maple neck with rosewood fretboard and skunk stripe. Early 80s rounded C neck profile. Medium jumbo frets. 9.5 fretboard radius. The neck is straight and the truss rod fully functional. The action is very low without any string/fret buzz. All electronics functions as it should and the guitar plays and sounds wonderful. Top loader Dan Smith tremolo bridge. Fender-Schaller tuners. Three flat-pole pickups. Powerful X1 bridge pickup. Great sound for the 80s pop and rock music. Original factory white pickguard and aged white pickup covers and knobs. One volume, one tone. Rare original unmodified guitar from early 80s that looks and plays like new. Minimal to no fretwear. Barely played over the last 35 years. Definitely a closet queen of investment value. No noticeable wear on the body and neck. One barely noticeable ding towards the edge of the upper bout of the body, but not through the finish (please see photo 11). One minor hairline finish crack on the outside of the neck pocket, treble side (the camera cannot capture it). The rest what you see on the photos that resembles any form of wear is nothing other than the camera glare. Overall condition of the guitar can be rated 9 out of 10. The Fender hardshell case shows some wear from sitting in storage/closet for many years and has couple of latches replaced, but is structurally sound, can be locked and fully protects the guitar. The guitar is sold as is. No surprises, no disappointments. Priced to sell fast. No returns. No international sales. No overseas shipping. The auction is limited to the continental U.S. (lower 48 states). No exceptions. Free local pickup and/or inspection.
