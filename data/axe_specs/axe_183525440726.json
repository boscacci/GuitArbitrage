{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Up for sale is my personal Gibson Les Paul Studio, with Ebony Fretboard, Chrome hardware in very good condition. It weighs in at 9 pounds, 5.3 ounces. It really sounds and plays very well. It's in beautiful shape, and all original, outside of the Schaller strap locks I had Sweetwater put on it (comes with original buttons). I am also including my *nice* soft leather strap. Comes with non original hardshell case (which is in \"does it's job\" condition, but if you're going to gig, I'd recommend a new and better case). It was set up with new strings by Sweetwater 9 months ago. As you can see, there is mild wear and tear on the guitar, but it's in very good condition given the vintage of this 25+ year old instrument. There are various small dings and imperfections in the lacquer, but no major flaws or damages. it's actually in really good and clean shape. I would rate it at 9/10. I think it's likely one of the nicer examples out there, given the age. Shipping from right here in the good 'ol USA.. not a weird scammy auction from Japan! Will be shipped with the strings loosened. I unwound each string working from the outside in by one turn at a time (properly).
