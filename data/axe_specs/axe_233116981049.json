{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Eastport Music Scene proudly presents this Used 2010 Gibson ES 335 Dot Reissue in Tobacco Sunburst with a beautiful Flamed Maple top and back. Please see all the photos in the gallery. Made on Sept 2nd 2010 in the U.S.A. this guitar has had only one owner who is an avid collector of fine instruments. The top and back of the guitar are Flamed Maple and look stunning. The finish is a Nitrocellulose Lacquer that has a few signs of wear that would be expected but overall it's really looking great. The neck is slim and has a beautiful Rosewood fretboard with jumbo frets. It plays so smoothly across the entire neck. Featuring two Gibson Classic Humbuckers, three way toggle switch, chrome hardware, two volume and two tone controls. This guitar is all about superior tone. In the neck position it's warm and silky, however in the bridge position the tone has bite and really cool grit to it. From Jazz to Blues to straight up Rock N Roll this Gibson delivers. It has a few minor scratches here and there but nothing to really dwell upon. It's a used guitar. The guitar will ship in the Original Hard Shell Case (OHSC). Overall this is a very clean, hardly played, beautiful Gibson ES 335 Dot Reissue. Enjoy! This guitar is being sold \"as is\".", "ItemID": "233116981049", "EndTime": "2019-02-02T20:08:35.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-01T02:55:42.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-2010-Gibson-ES335-Dot-Reissue-Flamed-Maple-Top-Sunburst-w-OHSC-/233116981049", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Eastport, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2331169810498080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTc2/z/YpwAAOSwbKVcU6TK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTUy/z/ao8AAOSwPg9cU6TO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mzc=/z/YpYAAOSwbKVcU6TC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NjQ=/z/Y~0AAOSwu3ZcU6TE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg4MTg=/z/YsIAAOSwk-1cU6TT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDcz/z/RF4AAOSwPA1cU6Te/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTEyNFgxNjAw/z/AWkAAOSwALlcU6Tl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTIyWDE2MDA=/z/M5MAAOSwsaVcU6Ts/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "11941", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "themusicscene", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 531, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "o***z", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 898}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Used 2010 Gibson ES335 Dot Reissue Flamed Maple Top Sunburst w/ OHSC", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Gibson ES"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Flamed Maple Top"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Gibson"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["ES-335"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 42, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=8043786", "StoreName": "Eastport Music Scene"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "This guitar has a few little scratches here and there but it's really clean.
