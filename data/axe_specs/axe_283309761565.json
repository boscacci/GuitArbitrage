{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This stunning Mosrite-style guitar is in barely used condition. It is hard to do justice to this guitar's looks, but I tried my best with the pictures above. Apologies for the strong glare. I detect a couple of light scuffs on the bridge pickup's plastic cover, but other than that this guitar looks new. The hard shell case (gator-like material) is in excellent shape too. Back story: When I ordered this guitar in the spring, it took two months before it was shipped because Hallmark was still finishing up this run of 60 Customs. While waiting, I had the opportunity to get a really good deal on a discontinued color from a friend of a friend. So the only reason I'm selling this one is because I don't need two of them, and this green and gold beauty is in superior condition. I couldn't resist playing it, but it was only briefly. It plays great and sounds amazing, just like the one I'm keeping. As of today (7/29) there is no fret buzz or any other issues.", "ItemID": "283309761565", "EndTime": "2018-12-29T16:50:01.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-20T02:25:04.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Hallmark-60-Custom-Sunset-Burst-Sparkle-Excellent-Condition-2018-/283309761565", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Lemon Grove, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833097615658080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IgUAAOSw~~NbXiHi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/haAAAOSwYSBbXiGg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IiMAAOSwjRFbXiHR/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RjAAAOSw9CRbXiHb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3MDE=/z/9f0AAOSwyglbXiG-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/kO8AAOSw98FbXiHK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/XTEAAOSwEfBbXiH-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/tZcAAOSwBp1bXiIk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "91945", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "megavila", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 294, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 699.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "i***h", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 22}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Hallmark 60 Custom Sunset Burst Sparkle Excellent Condition 2018", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2018"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}]}, "HitCount": 72, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Less than one hour of playing time.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
