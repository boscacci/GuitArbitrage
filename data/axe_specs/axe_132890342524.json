{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "A now discontinued guitar, this is a well-taken care of Paul Reed Smith SE Torero Electric Guitar in a Sapphire Finish. There is only one very minor ding in the binding on the body, about one inch above the 22nd fret area (as shown in last picture). It plays and sounds great, but I got this as a gift and find myself stuck on my Jacksons. I currently have it set up in Eb standard tuning with 9\u2019s, I believe. I\u2019d be willing to set it up differently if required. Here\u2019s a quick rundown: The SE Torero marries PRS playability with a Floyd Rose bridge, EMG pickups, and neck through body construction. The minimal/unpronounced heel smoothly blends into the body and the deeper, lower cutaway gives easier and smoother accessibility to the upper frets while the pick-ups provide power, clarity, and definition. These features all contribute to the Torero\u2019s notable sustain, and the bound ebony fretboard with jumbo frets and no inlays paired with a mahogany body and flame-maple veneer give this guitar a very distinct look. Perfect for the musician looking for that slightly heavier tone in a PRS instrument.
