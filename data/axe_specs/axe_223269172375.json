Supro - Hampton Lefty The Hampton is a 21st-century update of the Supro electric solid-body guitar. The elegant comfort of the 1960\u2019s-era beveled-edge Ozark body shape and the mighty sound of the original field-coil pickups have been enhanced with an ultra-fast satin neck, Tune-o-matic bridge and updated wave tailpiece. The Hampton\u2019s Gold Foil pickups use the same internal construction as the original \u201cClear-tone\u201d pickups, providing a massive, broadband sound with remarkably low noise for a single-coil design. The mini-humbucker-sized version of the Supro Gold Foil pickup found in this guitar has the same internal construction as the humbucker-sized versions found in the other Island Series models. The Hampton\u2019s bridge pickup is wound slightly hotter than the others, while the middle pickup is RWRP, providing fully hum-cancelling sound in the \u201c2 and 4\u201d positions of the 5-way blade switch. This guitar is in near mint condition and little to no wear and tear.
