{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello eBay Friends! For sale today we a 1989 Kramer Sustainer 1989 Kramer Sustainer Guitar w/ Floyd Rose Sustainer Hard Case Original Paperwork PLUS FREE SHIPPING!!!!!!!! I was the only owner and the Kramer Sustainer in great working condition ready for the stage or studio. Serial number on the guitar is F 9344 and built on September 28th, 1989 (see pictures for the paper work verification). PLEASE NOTE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS GUITAR: #1: This guitar is set up in Eb (half step down) with brand new Ernie Ball Hybrid Slinky Stings in the gauge of (009, 011, 016, 026, 036, 046) IF you want to take this guitar to Standard tuning you will have to use Ernie Ball Regular Slinky Strings (or any size that you want) but please know that you have to get the bridge re-set up for what ever new gauge and tuning that you want. Any pro guitar repair guy can do this in about 10 minutes or less so no big deal. #2: The Volume potentiometer has a broken post so you or your repair guy will have to place a new potentiometer, again no big deal and about 10 minutes of work to get it done. Volume potentiometer does work but the knob is just a bit loose and you will see that when you get the guitar. Two 9 volt batteries are required in the back small square plate to operate the Sustainer so make sure you place two NEW batteries in, the guitar is not shipping with batteries for safety's sake so that you are aware. This guitar comes from my personal collection so take care of it well, it will bring you magic songs :-) Buy with confidence, I have a 100% PERFECT eBay selling score!
