{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Hello. Here is an early 1994 Paul Reed Smith CE 24. Built in the first factory with all the desirable components. Nicely Flamed Maple top. Luscious Royal Blue. Alder , or Mahogany back. Wide thin neck with short/small heel. Frets are in great condition , with only slight string wear/ Frets were polished, and the rosewood board was treated with linseed oil. Low action, fast, and easy bendabilty. Smooth, and super easy to play! Phase 1 Schaller Germany made wing locking tuners. PRS Unobtanium nut. Super tight neck joint with no stress cracks.You can feel the vibe when strumming unamplified. NOTE: Pics. taken with an LG Phone. Not the best HD quality. Finish has some normal handling wear for a guitar this age. Some insignificant scuffs, some marrs, some dings, and swirls. No bad at all for a guitar this age. Overall super Clean, and looking super inviting. She Polished up superbly with Virtuoso polish. This has the 2nd phase PRS tremolo which has a great feel to it. Not stiff like the phase # 1 Mil Coms. Go figure? Tremolo has No wear at all. Looks Excellent. The original 5 way wafer rotary switch. and the original PRS treble bleed circuit. The Original White Label HFS, in bridge, and the Vintage Bass pick up in the neck dishes out all the tone you can ask for. Awesome tone, and tremendous control of your tone with the circuit, and the 5 way switch. PRS OHSC in good cond. The middle latch is a little crooked, but works( can be bent back to shape with vice grips) Tremolo arm in case. No paperwork, no hang tags, and No spec. card. I am Open to best offers, but somewhat firm as this is a rare , adult owned, and well kept piece of PRS History. I will cover full insurance on the guitar when shipping to you via Fed Ex.
