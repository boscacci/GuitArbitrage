{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fallen Angel electric 2008 (limited/legacy model) custom designed and made by Halo Guitars of California These guitars are getting very rare, as this was one of their launch models from over a decade ago that was very limited. Features: Solid carved mahogany body with a transparent crimson red finish 2 piece rock maple neck 24 easy access frets on a select rosewood fretboard with mother-of-pearl inlay fret markers 19.5\u201d long fretboard, 2\u201d wide Licensed Floyd Rose Tremolo system (works better than the ones on my Ibanez RGs!) Two high output GFS Power Rail humbucker pickups (LOUD!) Weighs about 8 pounds I am the original owner, a non-smoker, and have taken care of this guitar with professional guitar cleaners and wax. I'm certain you could restore it to museum-quality with little effort. I did not gig with this guitar. It was at home only. So there is absolutely no travel damage. No deep cuts or hard scrapes through the clear coat. There are just small scratches on the back (they are actually clear, but the photo light makes it look white), some very light pick scratches, a few tiny nicks on the headstock, and a very small dent below the tremolo (arrived from factory like this). For the collectors, I am also including my stack of business cards, referral documentation, and Halo guitar pick.
