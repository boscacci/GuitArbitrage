{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Fernandes Silver Gray Revolver Electric Guitar: serial #FG11111006, This is still a great playing little axe with a great neck (excellent frets) and low play actiojn. The electronics all work fine w/o any static or dirt. Tremolo is complete and works well. The only flaw is it has a few nicks and digs as the pics show. ** it looks almost green in the pics but is more silver gray- headstock pic is closest) Strings are getting near their end. I am going to sell it as it sits so we can keep the price down.
