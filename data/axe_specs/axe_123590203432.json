Beautiful carved flame maple top, dark red translucent finish, set neck, humbucker-single-humbucker pickups,Shark fin inlays,single volume control,single tone control,5-way switch to control which pickups you want to use,Licensed locking Floyd Rose type tremolo, and cast tuning gears. Except for a couple micro-dings this guitar could pass for new. In fact it's better than new because after restringing it with D'Addario 9-42s I spent an hour and a half setting up the tremolo and adjusting the intonation. This is crucial to the playability of the instrument and dealers (let alone internet outlets) WILL NOT take the time to do this. This guitar was built in Korea for Brownsville Guitars out of New York. It is a THIN BODY guitar that is extremely comfortable to play! Pictures show how clean this guitar is!
