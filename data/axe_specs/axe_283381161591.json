{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This Custom Shop Stratocaster was built in 1990 by JW Black, founding master luthier of the Fender Custom Shop facility in Corona, Ca. It is signed by him on the headstock w/ the Custon Shop label of the time period as seen in photos. The Certificate Of Authenticity (COA) is included and is signed by John Page, who was the original, founding Custom Shop Manager. This guitar was played by Joe Walsh in a 1993 Eagles concert in Aspen, Colorado. A full sized (30\"x36\") poster is included with the guitar where you can see the distinctive grain pattern in the photo which proves the authenticity of this - Glen Frye is standing next to Joe singing (see photo). So this guitar has quite the pedigree!! It is finished in a transparent blue-burst with metal-flake sparkles. The birdseye maple neck is straight and fast with low action. This guitar plays like butter. Wonderful tone and feel ! There are no major scuffs or dings - just normal wear you would expect for a guitar almost 30 years old. It has been pampered and well cared for. Incredible sounding, Kinman noiseless Hank Marvin custom pickups.This is a truly fine instrument that fully lives up to Fender's Custom Shop reputation. Tweed hardshell case included.", "ItemID": "283381161591", "EndTime": "2019-02-19T14:03:25.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-15T20:35:55.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Custom-Shop-Fender-Stratocaster-1990-COA-w-tweed-HDC-Joe-Walsh-Eagles-concert-/283381161591", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Floral City, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833811615918080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/~I4AAOSwUPlcZxUI/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA4MFgxNjAw/z/szsAAOSwaAtcZxUw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTUwWDE2MDA=/z/SJcAAOSwWiJcZxVl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTYx/z/4vwAAOSwtOZcZxVK/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMzc3/z/ZDcAAOSwOKlcZxVa/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg3Mzg=/z/dJ4AAOSwRiFcZxWV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2NjY=/z/RDEAAOSwM6VcZxWX/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/FJsAAOSwA4VcZxV4/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjMwWDE2MDA=/z/zOoAAOSwY7lcZxWA/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/~KkAAOSwIVVcZxWV/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQ2MVgxNTk5/z/a4oAAOSw9C5cZxWl/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjUwWDE2MDA=/z/zRQAAOSwTkFcZxWu/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "34436", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "skydog2211", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 252, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 3250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 3250.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***5", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Blue", "FeedbackScore": 92}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Custom Shop Fender Stratocaster 1990 COA w/ tweed HDC.- Joe Walsh Eagles concert", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1990"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Ultra"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}]}, "HitCount": 94, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
