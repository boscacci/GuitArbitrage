{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Tagima is the largest Brazilian manufacturer of guitars and basses/ The company was founded by Seizi Tagima a top Brazilian luthier of Japanese ancestry, in the 1980s. All guitars were made in Brazil until 1996, after that some of the production moved to Korea and then China. The BLUES 3000 model is manufactured by Zhunyi Shenqu Musical Instruments, a smaller \"boutique\" manufacturer in China. The guitar is a top-quality copy of ES-335, comparable, if not superior to the best Epiphone and Ibanez Artcore semi-acoustics. I chose this one because it had slaightly larger frets and more interesting pickups than an Epi -- powerful, crisp and sensitive to picking dynamics. The guitar is in mint condition and has been professionally setup. The frets have no wear. The action is low and comfy and the instrument has excellent sustain and plays beautifully overall. The guitar is all maple, including the body and the neck, and being such, it weighs about the same as a Les Paul. I installed AllParts locking tuners on it but will include the original ones too. The heavily padded and sculpted hard case is very nice and secure.
