{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I've sold 3 of these and people love them. They are beautiful instruments! The genuine American-made Seymour Duncan Jazz (neck) and JB (bridge) humbuckers give it 'tone to the bone' - clean or distorted. Play blues, rock, jazz, anything your heart desires! (I use a Boss BD-2 Blues Driver pedal and play it through a Kustom Defender 50W tube amp. Tone to die for.) Distinctive design with uptown appointments. Comes with a brand new deluxe gig bag- an OSP Vintage Tweed Duraguard 25mm thick bag. See the listing for one at https://www.ebay.com/itm/OSP-Vintage-Tweed-Duraguard-Electric-Guitar-Gig-Bag-25mm-3-Compartments-/131556643334. I'll also include the strap shown in pics (leather). This is a PC model NOT the newer, cheaper PS !!!!!!!!!! I believe it's a 2008 model based upon the serial number on back of headstock. W05088554 I would consider a trade (we both buy each other's listing) for a decent cello...long story. Check my feedback and buy with complete confidence! I ship within 24 hours of purchase. It will be fully insured and signature will be required for delivery. (Porch bandits would love this). If you need to give it as a present, I'd print off a picture and give them that until it arrives! If shipping with insurance is less than $45, I'll refund difference but prices keep going up.With its semi-hollow single-cutaway mahogany body and flamed maple top, this modern spin on a vintage-classic looks fantastic and sounds incredible. The ESP Xtone guitar features a 3-piece maple neck with rosewood fretboard, decked out with pearl and abalone block inlays. A 3-layer creme binding trims the body, neck, headstock, and f-hole, while gold hardware completes its uptown appearance. The Seymour Duncan Jazz (neck) and JB (bridge) gold-covered humbuckers gives it class and tonal versatility. Equipped with a tune-o-matic bridge with stopbar tailpiece and XJ frets. Controls include tone and volume for each pickup and 3-way switching.FEATURESConstruction: set neckScale: 24-3/4\"Body: mahogany with bookmatched flamed maple topNeck/Fretboard: 3-piece maple/rosewoodNeck Shape: Thin UNut: Standard / 43 mmInlays: pearl and abalone blocksPickups: Seymour Duncan Jazz (neck) and JB (bridge) gold-covered humbuckersElectronics: 2 volume, 2 tone, 3-way toggleHardware: goldTuners: GroverBridge: tune-o-matic with stop tailpieceBinding: triple-layer creme (body, neck, headstock)Frets: 22 XJ", "ItemID": "233078677618", "EndTime": "2019-01-08T23:43:15.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-02T22:18:44.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/RARE-ESP-LTD-XTONE-PC-1-Semi-Hollow-Electric-Guitar-Real-Duncans-NEW-DLX-GIG-BAG-/233078677618", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Carmel, Indiana", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2330786776188080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/HbIAAOSwpTBcB-kS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/5fkAAOSwt3hcB-wC/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/alcAAOSwaalcB-kN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/-EUAAOSwvfpcB-kP/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/50wAAOSw0YlcB-kU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/xtcAAOSwRjxcB-kW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/DFIAAOSwbKdcB-kY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/N8gAAOSwwqVcB-ka/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDEwNjc=/z/ukIAAOSwu4dcB-kc/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDEwNjc=/z/-6EAAOSwc6ZcB-kf/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/54MAAOSwvqVcB-kI/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2N1g2MDA=/z/BZYAAOSw6dhcB-kK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "46032", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "honestabemusic", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1778, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 449.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***n", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 548}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "RARE ESP LTD XTONE PC-1 Semi-Hollow Electric Guitar Real Duncans NEW DLX GIG BAG", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Semi-Hollow"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["PC-1 Ltd Xtone"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple top and Mahogany body"]}, {"Name": "Features", "Value": ["Seymour Duncan Pickups", "Grover tuners", "Single Cut", "Volume Knob"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Xtone"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Korea, Republic of"]}]}, "HitCount": 84, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Fantastic condition.
