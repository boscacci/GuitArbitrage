Purchased new in Kentucky, in 1999 for $340+tax and that was a sale price,*guitar was assembled in Japan in 09/1998. ( thats over $500 in today's money, only when adjusted for inflation) I bought it for my collection , 1st owner, manual/warranty papers included as picturedfor 20 years,it was mostly just sitting in its hard-shell case and now, its up for sale so i can offset some large purchases that i have recently made.Fernandez Decade is a Japanese answer to Fender Jazz-master / Jaguar . If you love Fender Strats ,Jazz-masters Jaguar, Mustang etc.. you will love Fernandes its a MUST have for people who know and can appreciate these high quality instruments or who collect them or, who like a rare instrument.I doubt that there are more of these out there in this condition/ deluxe version.
