{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a very nice pre-owned Charvel DS-2 of the Desolation series. The specs below were obtained from a couple guitar sights in order to give you as much detail as possible. I am not a guitar expert so any information provided is based on best efforts to properly describe the item. The guitar is in very good condition but not mint. You can see from the pics there is a varnish bump on the bottom edge. The remainder of the unit seems to be in great shape and ready to play. The guitar comes in a Roadrunner soft backpack carry case which is also in great condition. The Desolation DS-2 ST has been upgraded with new multi-ply neck and body binding, new metallic \u201ckeystone\u201d fingerboard inlays and stylish satin-chrome hardware. Continuing premium features include a carved-top single-cutaway mahogany body, through-body mahogany neck with scalloped heel, compound radius (12\u201d-16\u201d) rosewood fingerboard with 24 jumbo frets, dual Charvel active humbucking pickups with three-way toggle switching, Charvel bridge specially designed for compound-radius fingerboards, three-on-a-side Charvel tuners, and solid and trans finishes (flame maple veneer on trans finishes) with matching headstocks.
