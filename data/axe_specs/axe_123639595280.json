{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is an Electra guitar from the late 70s and early 80s. I was able to sand the body and neck down to the natural wood color. It\u2019s original color was a walnut. It has DiMarzio Style pickups that work as they should. There is a phase switch that allows for a single coil sound. One volume and two tone controls. I originally wanted to stain it the original color. It can be made to be new like. Guitar is made thinner and lighter than the Les Paul models and has its own style. The original case is included and is very good condition. Paypal preferred. Returns made within five days. Please notify seller with any concerns. Will require signature for delivery.
