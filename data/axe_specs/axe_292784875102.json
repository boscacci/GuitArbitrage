{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "What it is is a 2008 Ibanez RG2550z Prestige Its a great sounding and playing guitar, and from a foot away looks pretty good. What it\u2019s not is a closet queen. Things I know about it are it has its fair share of dings mostly around the edges it looks like and the typical neck pocket surface cracks. It has vinyl wrap on the front and back that doesn\u2019t look bad at all but, I have no idea how it looks underneath it as I took it on trade and it came to me this way. If these thing don\u2019t bother you this is a great guitar for you. It\u2019s missing the truss rod cover and strap screws. I\u2019ve tried to describe it best I can please ask any questions before buying it is sold as is. It 100% works and does play and sound really good and it\u2019s still a MIJ Prestige, For this reason alone I\u2019m really torn about selling it.", "ItemID": "292784875102", "EndTime": "2018-10-30T20:29:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-10-23T20:29:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2008-Ibanez-Prestige-RG2550Z-Guitar-Team-J-Craft-MIJ-Read-Full-Description-/292784875102", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Adamsville, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2927848751028080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg2Nzg=/z/HAsAAOSwtItbz4A9/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9uUAAOSwJiRbz4BC/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/eZcAAOSwRBVbz4BE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3OkAAOSwE95bz4BN/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jyIAAOSwF2Fbz4BK/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/jOcAAOSwL4Rbz4A8/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/KJ0AAOSwAE9bz4BG/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/NLwAAOSwFxJbz4BI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwMFgxMDA2/z/MhYAAOSwRF1bz4A6/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMTA0/z/Fe0AAOSwv1dbz4A~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vAUAAOSwArFbz4BA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/o0cAAOSwhGtbz4BH/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "35005", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mjones53", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 543, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 3, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 373.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 373.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "r***g", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 378}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2008 Ibanez Prestige RG2550Z Guitar \"Team J Craft.\" MIJ Read Full Description", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ibanez RG"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2008"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Ibanez Prestige RG2550Z"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Galaxy White"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 495, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 378.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
