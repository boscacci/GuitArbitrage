# GuitArbitrage

## Trawls eBay for undervalued used guitars.

The idea was initially to train a model to estimate what the final auction price of your guitar would be - before you post it. 

Estimates would be based on the item sale settings and item characteristics: Auction duration, return policy, and other technical features, combined with the features you enter about the guitar (body material, country of manufacture, brand, color, right-or-left handed..etc), as well as the text you enter into the title, description, and other fields.

So I pulled a lot of real eBay data: about 15k closed used guitar auctions that ended in sales (caveat). I parsed and visualized the data, wrangled the seemingly relevant features, and threw them at a lasso regression model. This included TF-IDF transformed text bigrams, which resulted in features like "hardshell_case" and "mint_condition". 

Predictive performance on a holdout test set wasn't very good; RMSE was only about 18-25% better than just guessing the mean.

What I then realized was that mine was a pretty conservative estimator, price-wise: It usually guessed too low. If I re-framed it as a classification problem ("will a guitar sell for more than X dollars?"), then I had far more false negatives than false positives. This led me to believe it wasn't totally useless.

So now it's trained to trawl eBay for what it thinks are undervalued guitars, put together a little email with its findings, and send them wherever you like.
